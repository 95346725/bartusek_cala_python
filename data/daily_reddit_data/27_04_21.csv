**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

mznup5,,stocks,post,1619528230,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies. Following is the split of recommendations. 

|Rating |\# of records |% of total |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy|35,158|52.9%|
|Hold|27,033|40.6%|
|Sell|4,041|6.1%|
|Others (Cautious, Speculative etc.)|284|0.4%|

 For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation

b. One month after recommendation

c. One quarter after recommendation

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.

**Results:**

**Performance of Buy Recommendations** 

|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Week|0.5%|0.3%|\+40.7%|
|One Month|1.7%|1.4%|\+23.2%|
|One Quarter|4.9%|4.0%|\+22.8%|

 Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

**Performance of Sell Recommendations:**

|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Week|0.3%|0.3%|\-7.3%|
|One Month|1.8%|1.5%|\+17.1%|
|One Quarter|5.4%|4.0%|\+36.0%|

Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative) 

 **Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** 

you can find the chart [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mznidl/oc_i_analyzed_66000_buy_and_sell_recommendations/)  

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired.

**Conclusion:**

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

The Company ultimately sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $551,000,000. Net proceeds will be used to continue accelerating GameStop’s transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening the Company’s balance sheet.

Maybe someone has a method for it, but this is mine: 

I try to think of an industry I'd like to get involved with, and then I google companies within that industry. After that, I start digging into financials for those companies, and based on value investing principles, I try to find out if some of them are trading below what I think their intrinsic value is.

Value investing is a time-tested approach to investing, but it takes time to do your DD on those companies. The usual book recommendations are Benjamin Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor"". In order to learn how to analyze stocks, I usually suggest to learn the basics of financial accounting and taking it from there. 

There are thousands of companies listed on NYSE. Few people have analyzed all of them, but if you list them all on a spreadsheet and pick one at random, chances are you'll land on a ticker you've never heard of.",['GOOGL']

They were put in my parents name.  We found the actual stock certificates after going through some old boxes.   Apparently in 2016 the state I live in (Virginia) sold the stock as there are some laws that say(I'm terribly paraphrasing as I don't understand this at all) if nothing was done with the stock and it was deemed inactive, ownership of the stock is given to the state of the last known residence of the original owner.

Edit: I'm looking at them now.  The 8 shares bought in 1992 were purchased in December of that year so post split and the 16 shares purchased in 1998 were purchased on July 9th of that year.  So would that mean the 8 from 1992 would have turned into 24 in 1998 and the 16 bought in 1998 look like they missed the split by like 3 weeks (lol god dammit) for a total of 40 shares in 2016 when the state sold them?",

mznq3x,,stocks,post,1619527799,"What is going on with stock valuation right now?Tl;dr I want to buy stocks but everything has a P/E ratio double that of what is historically normal, what is going on and why are value ETFs long on so many overvalued positions?

Hey all, newbie question here:

I’m new to investing and learning the basics of stock valuation. The way I understand it, you start by looking at a company’s price to earnings ratio, or P/E. From moneychimp.com:

> Although discounted cash flows is the correct way to value a company, people naturally like to use simpler rules of thumb. The P/E ratio is the most popular because it's easy to understand. **If you buy stock at a P/E ratio of 15, say, then it will take 15 years for the company's earnings to add up to your original purchase price - 15 years to ""pay you back"".** That's assuming that the company is already in its ""mature"" stage, where earnings are constant.

It goes on to say that you may want to buy at a high PE ratio if you expect earnings to keep increasing. 

My understanding is also that the average P/E ratio historically has been somewhere in the ballpark of 13-15. Anything below that, all other fundamentals being equal, is considered a healthy buy.

Now I’m looking into large cap ETFs (I don’t have any positions yet) and checking the valuation of their top holdings and.... I’m seeing P/E ratios *way above* the historical average. Just some examples from this morning:

AAPL: 36.42

GOOG: 37.20

MSFT: 38.96

WMT: 29.06

JNJ: 28.99

AMZN: 81.51 ?!!

TSLA: 1,158.65 ??!!?!

I get that the highest values here are tech, which may have a strong expectation to keep growing, but Tesla with a P/E ratio in the thousands? Is this normal? Is this the result of massive money printing going straight to Wall Street and inflated stock prices relative to consumer goods (and thus relative to earnings)? What is going on? Thanks in advance.","['MSFT', 'WMT', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'JNJ', 'TSLA']"

mznq3x,gw1o4jc,stocks,comment,1619528901,"There is a lot of talk about the markets being in a bubble, especially when it comes to tech. 

I'm not going to go into whether or not it actually is a bubble, since that's a different discussion, but no one would disagree that many companies, such as the ones OP has listed, are trading at what is **historically** considered pretty overvalued. 

You can't stare too much at a single metric, though. P/E is useful, but you have to consider it in the wider context of a given company's financials and market share. Low P/E can lead to investing into a value trap, i.e. it looks cheap but there's still a reason for it being cheap. 

Now, given high P/E values, it doesn't mean the price of a given stock can't appreciate even more. Regardless of how justified or irrational you consider those valuations, the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Historically speaking, current valuations aren't exactly normal. There are many reasons for this, including but not limited to: tech is booming, liquidity, money that should be in bonds find their way into stocks, meme/hype. But what is normal? The markets have never been exactly ""normal"". It's possible we're looking at a wider paradigm shift here and that's the cause for current valuations.

Presentation material from RTX website, where it goes into detail:

https://investors.rtx.com/events/event-details/first-quarter-2021-earnings-conference-call

Zacks Post:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.zacks.com/amp/stock/news/1461160/raytheon-technologies-rtx-tops-q1-earnings-estimates

**TEXT**

Raytheon Technologies came out with quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.78 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this an aerospace and defense company would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of 4.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Raytheon Technologies, which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry, posted revenues of $15.25 billion for the quarter ended March 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.83%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $18.21 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Raytheon Technologies shares have added about 12.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.3%.What's Next for Raytheon Technologies?

While Raytheon Technologies has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Raytheon Technologies was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.80 on $15.72 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.64 on $65.13 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense Equipment is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.","['SPGI', 'RTX', 'AMP']"

mz7esj,,stocks,post,1619469583,"As someone who started their investment portfolio in January 2021, I have finally broken even todayI have been following the stock market very peripherally for a few years now.

When the COVID pandemic happened and stocks tumbled, that made sense to me. What did not make a whole lot of sense was the unbelievable ascent that took place immediately after.

I’m a grad student and so I don’t have a job at the moment (will graduate next month though and finally start earning money hopefully), so I couldn’t risk putting my savings in the markets and instead I sat on the sidelines watching everybody make a ton of money except me.

By the end of 2020, I said enough was enough and decided that it was time to stop watching and finally start my own investment portfolio. That was my New Years resolution and by the middle of January I had finished my due diligence on all the companies and stocks I wanted to buy and I moved two-thirds of all the cash I had in my name into the stock market...

It was a very good few weeks for me after that, and then February happened...

I felt like such a dumbass for watching all the gains take place and then as soon as I moved my money in a correction took place. Of course I was overweight on tech and growth and so I was down about 12% of my investments all within the first 4 weeks of when I started trading.

It was definitely a gut punch and made me question if I actually knew anything at all about stocks, but I knew that selling would be stupid so I just waited.

It was hard not checking my Fidelity app every single day, but I’m happy to say that today I’m finally back to where I started. I could sell it all right now and it would be as if I had just kept all my money in my savings account this entire time.

myvz3u,gvxojcn,stocks,comment,1619448699,"I think the important thing to consider here is the volume you are trading. Also, you need to consider the 'Wash Rule', which I only recently learned about due to that article that hit earlier this year. 

Wash Rule Summary: Any losses you receive on a stock are added to your base price if you buy back into the stock within 30 days. 

Wash Example using 1 share for simplicity: If you have a basis of 100, sell for 90, you have a $10 loss. If you buy back in 29 days later at $80, that $10 loss is added to the $80 cost, meaning your new basis for the share is $90. 

Because this rule, you cannot count that $10 in 'Losses' against your taxes, as it is now part of your new basis for the shares you purchased. 

&#x200B;

Now, if you were to sell 1000 shares at 90, you would have $90k on hand, with a loss of $10k. If you use the $90k to buy 1200 shares ($75/share), you have increased your position by 20%. Your cost basis for the 1200 shares is $83.33 ($100k / 1200 shares). 

&#x200B;

So basically, it CAN be worth it (with large volumes), but may not be once you factor in taxes too. Re-purchasing the shares like this resets your 'Long' position into a 'Short' position, pretty sure anyway. 

If you are doing small volumes, don't waste your time and money unless you somehow anticipate it dropping immensely. As others have said, time in market is better than hoping to time the market.",

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

mzgodf,,stocks,post,1619498660,"What are y'all bullish on these days?I am actually quite bullish on tech right now and it's the highest percentage of my portfolio that it's ever been, more than 7%! I have positions in lam research, amd, Snap, and I want back into intel (sold before earnings because it was getting a bit crazy and easy to see the drop coming.)

AMD I scooped up on a dip and have been happy, I bought some more today and averaged up a tiny bit. I am actually not the biggest fan of their pc parts, but it's because I'm old school and just prefer intel CPUs and nvidia gpus. But many enthusiasts are actually using AMD these days, and their numbers have been well. They have a PEG of ~1.5 which doesn't exactly make it great value right now, but I think the stock is undervalued compared to peers. I will hold this and average down if when I get the opportunity.

Lam research has a PEG of 1.2 and I expected it to be higher honestly. I bought the stock with the intent to hold for long and average down over time but I haven't even had that opportunity yet. Wish I bought a bit more to trim, but I think I will stick to my guns and hold it long. 

Snaps just a long hold, definitely way overvalued, but I expect to average down at some point. I'm honestly in snapchat because my portfolio has been very boring lately, and I've owned the stock before at much lower prices. Their earnings report wasn't terrible, wasn't great, but I think as the years go on the company will be able to do well. I'm not really too attached to this play, it's a small percentage and it's a bit speculative and not really my style, but for now I'm a happy holder especially since they did breakeven on this earnings.

Intel is a powerhouse and many call it a value trap, I think the markets just waiting for them to stop making mistakes and I think Pat will be able to SLOWLY turn them around. Long hold and I will buy some soon, haven't gotten back in it yet.

I'm also extremely bullish on oil and energy. Brent has been doing very well and holding for now, and I think that the debt the oil companies has accumulated was actually beneficial because it's so cheap. Exxon and chevron I love, as well as the pipelines. (I sold all my enbridge early, and may sell some puts to try and get back in at a small discount)

Carbon capture is a tried and true method of reducing emissions, albeit not the best way of going green, but it will be profitable IF Biden can put a price on co2. BP, shell, and exxon all already do this as well as many other companies. Don't know too much about it but I did some light reading for a couple hours and it's old stuff been around since the 70s, but it does work and is a realistic next step in reducing emissions. Definitely not a permanent solution but I see it as a necessary stepping stone and there may be money to be made.

Oil is also not going anywhere for at least a decade, probably longer, so I believe these companies are all extremely undervalued even after their run ups. Going forward 2 years I think even when oil prices normalize,  I think the giants will be in a better position overall. 

I like GE for their wind turbines as well, although it's much smaller scale and doesn't really bring much to stock price. I believe Siemens does this as well, but I do not own siemens. With Biden in office and oil prices getting high, it's the perfect storm for greener energies.

I went into this earnings season a bit bearish and I still expect it to be rocky, so properly hedging should be on everybodies list as well. But I believe the bull market will be fine over the next year, albeit not completely smooth. Healthcare is a solid industry to invest in during times like these as the big names are quite undervalued. I'm not bullish on healthcare, but it's a savings account and it's not volatile when everything else is, so its a defensive play when IV is very low.","['INTC', 'GE', 'PEG', 'UPS', 'LRCX', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'CVX']"

mzumed,,stocks,post,1619546728,"Analyzing an Earnings Report (quick and short version)For earnings reports, public companies are required to submit a 10-Q (quarterly report) or annual report (10-K) with the SEC. The 10-Q is unaudited, meaning it has not been approved by a certified external auditor. The 10-K is audited. You can read more about the details of 10-Q and 10-K forms on any financial website. Or google.

So let's go over the fast way to read an earnings report.

1. Before an earnings report releases, make sure you look at the past earnings metrics or have it with you to compare the upcoming earnings report. Some things to consider about any earnings report: sentiment going into earnings, industry momentum, and macro condition can affect the swings in stock price to make option plays worthless. Trade carefully.
2. Take a look at the revenues, earnings per share, and net income. Compare it to past quarters and the last few years in that same quarter. Did the company grow Q/Q and Y/Y? Does the company have a history of seasonal cycles?
3. Look at expenses. Did they spend more/less than previous quarters/years? What was the operational margin? What's the profit margin on their products and/or services? Was there anything unusual in their operational/product expenses that wouldn't normally be there?
4. If a company performs poorly compared to estimates, do research on why. Some variables can be: supply chain issues (like many companies are having right now), decreasing demand in their products/service, increasing competition, changing trends, talent going to other companies, execution of various strategies (marketing for example), etc.
5. Even if a company performs well after an earnings report, take a look why. It's easy when you your favorite company's stock goes up. It's green, it doesn't matter. Well in fact it does. Because if you want your favorite company to perform well in every or most quarters in the future, you have to understand its business model. Pay attention to their guidance and how the executives phrase their words. An [article back in 2017](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/finance/2017/article/how-listen-hidden-data-earnings-calls) dissected the words from 17,419 earnings call transcripts. On average, ""have an issue"" ranked in the top phrase used in those calls coming at just more than 3%. In those calls it was repeated just more than 5 times. Coming in 2nd was ""headwind"" and was repeated just over 10 times in an earnings call. In short, listen to the earnings call or read the transcript. News media outlets will spin words to make a company appear bad (like Tesla) when in reality nothing bad happened. Educate yourselves. Media is just noise.

So in short, ask yourselves:

How did the company perform financially Q/Q and Y/Y? What factors led to these results? What does guidance say about its future? Will the financials grow more, less, or the same? What are the headwinds and tailwinds? Will upcoming trends and macroeconomical conditions affect future growth?

If you can answer these questions, you're on a good path. If you cannot, more research is required.

For some companies, understanding their business model and the industry they're in can be difficult to assess. Tesla is a great example because of the extremes of the two sides, bulls and bears (TESLAQ). Tesla is in a unique position because their earnings consist of EV credits, and in this earnings cycle, they sold about $100 million in Bitcoin. They also didn't have an S/X models delivered or produced because of the refresh. So how did the company beat on earnings? What's their guidance? I'll leave that for all to research yourselves :)

Anyway, this is just a quick way to understanding earnings reports. Understanding a company's potential is based on some factors like the industry its in, business model, and more. It takes a few hours or less to read an earnings report and understanding the financials. It takes hours or days to actually understand a company as a whole. IMO, don't read stock books. Read about businesses, the industries they're in, their TAM/SAM/SOM. If you really want to make money, you need to understand where the world is transitioning to. Ask, ""are electric vehicles the future?"", ""is telemedicine relevant even after COVID?"", ""do I and my friends/family/coworkers go to the gym anymore? or do we attend zoom fitness classes?"", ""are users moving away from Netflix to other streaming services?""

Hope this helps some people with their research!","['NFLX', 'TSLA']"

There seems to be a lot of opinion on CDR (Warsaw) aka OTGLY (ADR) so I figured I would throw mine into the wild as well. This is mostly bullish and I do hold a very small position so obviously, I am biased. I posted this in another thread prior but someone pointed out that its probably good enough to get its own, so here it is. Feel free to correct my numbers or point out material stuff I may have missed.

Not all comparisons are apples to apples. They are just used to help me quantify things in a way so that I can make a valuation call.

Here is my analysis:

1. They have about 1100 workers now
   1. Witcher 3 only had 250
   2. CP2077 had 400 by release
   3. Supposedly about 50 work on app stuff and another 100 on online games
   4. .. do the math... A lot of missing workers who havent been seen in a long time. Where are they?
2. The  last presentation stated clearly that they will be working on 2 AAA  games in parallel by 2022 and they wanted to push more into mobile and  side stuff thought they didnt elaborate on this.
   1. Odds are they already are working on the next AAA if you are following the logic from #1 above.
3. CP2077  sold 14m copies by end of last year... this is far from failure as some people have claimed. In  fact it was extremely profitable and they had their best year in company  history.
   1. It only did poorly on consoles but most of those sales are on PC where the game was playable from day 1 and was no more or less buggy than any other big open world game.
4. Their current PE is about 16... granted its very cyclical due to release times but even so, that is extremely low and see points 1 and 2 above. It seems that the cyclicality time frame is about to get reduced or possibly normalized with other products.
5. Witcher as a franchise alone, is probably worth more than $4b by itself.
   1. What is the VG brand worth? It has global recognition now.
   2. It has enormous sales. Witcher 3, alone, sold 30m copies. Lets say average $15 net each overall gives us a net profit of $450m.
      1. Total rev is probably north of $2b.
      2. This is just Witcher 3... what about the other related games?
   3. The  only issue with net/revenue is timing. If its once per 5 years, its not  so great but thats simply a function of the company who owns it, not of  the franchise itself. At a bigger company, there is no reason why they  cant leverage scale to do a yearly release of some sort, be it offshoots  or major expansions.
      1. Clearly, CDR has already realized this hence the huge employment push.
   4. Now some perspective.
      1. The last 5 Star Wars films, grossed about $1.3b worldwide each. Their net combined was reported to be $1.8 or about $350m each. Now obviously, SW makes money in other ways as well so its not apples to apples, but the point here is that Witcher games are likely to outperform SW movies and no, the movies are not cheaper to make. They cost about more than $250m each. Witcher 3 was reported to cost $265m.
      2. Total sales of Witcher 3 rival those of COD (2019), Diablo 3+extras, & Skyrim.
6. Their profit margins are higher than most other companies due to their own  publishing & marketing platform at GOG. So there is a good chance the average net is higher than I listed.
   1. GOG  is the #2 publisher outside of consoles. That has to be worth something  to someone. Even though it doesnt generate much profit yet, it has a good reputation and is generally preferred over all the competitors not named Steam. That has to be worth north of $2b if not more for the customer install base alone.
      1. Growth here should be good going forward because it is decoupled from their own releases specifically.
      2. They  seem to be pushing to innovate the platform. Its needed and it also  means that there might be a lot more profit to be made here down the line.
   2. Sales are still trending to digital sales. Digital sales are more profitable so future releases are likely to have better margins.
7. I honestly dont think their reputation will be hurt by CP2077. I think thats a reach by highly emotional people. Will people not buy Elder Scrolls because the last 2 Fallouts sucked? ... come on... not a chance. I cant wait for it myself despite knowing that they will keep dumbing it down for masses. Thank goodness for mods. And mind you, FO76 was far worse than CP2077 at release.
   1. Further, CDR handled the problem like professionals. They didnt just laugh and walk away.
8. The one thing I dont like about CDR is their Polish local. Poland is known to be more corrupt than other EU nations but AFAIK, that seems to be isolated to a few specific corporations, namely in the energy sector. It is still EU and corruption exists everywhere so I take it on a case to case basis. CDR has been around a long time. So far, I dont know of any government issues with them.
   1. On the plus side. Wages in Poland for devs is incredibly cheap compared to the USA... software devs average sub USD $2000/mo.... yes thats not a typo. Thats how much journeymen in development make in Poland. Obviously cost of living there is far lower too so thats probably why. But since they sell their game globally, thats a big competitive advantage.

So IMHO, Witcher + GOG alone are probably worth north of $6b... the  company right now is valued below $5b... Thus, right now, this seems like the  gem of the gaming industry. I cant imagine that other gaming companies arent eyeing it for buyout but CDR has stated in the past that its not interested. That was a long time ago so I dont know the current status.

Also my $6b valuation assumes Cyberpunk is worth $0... 14m copies sold  mostly on PC is no joke. Release cycles are also about to get cut in  half. See point 1 and 2 above.

Last, I think there is a good chance we will see a AAA release next year or early 2023. I would be  surprised otherwise because, again, about 500 employees are MIA right  now and have been for about 2 years.... what are they doing?

Other rev  streams will include CP2077 on consoles bringing in some extra cash, DLC  after that, and some other smaller projects and of course, whatever  they make at GOG which is profitable right now though not a big cash  maker yet.",['MO']

i understand how CSP work. (atleast in robinhood).

if you sell to open lets say arbitrarily, $40p 14 may 21  on company ABC. to open a CSP, you need $4000 in cash in your account. this cash gets tied up and you get the premium. if underlying goes below $40, you buy 100 shares of ABC at $40 each with the $4k that was tied up. if it stays above, you pocket the premium and you get your $4k back.

Here is a small part from the article I found regarding upcoming Apple earnings: ""

Apple could crush Street estimates, writes Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, who has an Overweight rating and a $158 price target on the stock, up 17% from Monday’s close of $134.72. She sees the top line above $80 billion, with all segments growing at least 19% year over year. She is especially bullish on Mac and iPad sales, with estimates far above consensus—53% for Macs and 52% for iPads. She also expects Apple to increase its dividend by 10% and expand its stock repurchase program by $60 billion.

mze4nb,gw0c9he,stocks,comment,1619492621,"First of all, what does the company do? Why is it something that will either be relatively stable or even more important to humanity in the future? I don't feel that bullish about buying coal stocks this year.

Ok, how about other companies who do the same thing- why wouldn't you rather buy their stocks instead? Is your stock belonging to a small but growing company in that sector? Why is it growing? What is it doing right? There are a ton of EV companies in China getting attention this year. Why did Warren Buffet pick one and WSB another?

Is it a good time of year for buying your stock? For example, everyone wants to have clothing retailer stocks when they are reporting Q4 earnings. Nobody wants to be buying then. Buy after everybody else is done taking profit.

What's the company's situation with debt? High debt to assets (more debt than assets) or not so much? Is it mostly short-term debt or long-term? Is the company turning a profit? All the revenue in the world is not impressive if it gets eaten up by keeping the lights on. A certain stock beloved by non-human primates has shot up today upon news that a ton of the company's debt has been retired early, and the at the market offering of 3.5 million shares has been completed without the stock falling like a stone. That company's balance sheet is now a lot healthier, and they will be able to use the rest of the new money to change the business to run primarily online and be more customer service focused. I'm not convinced it will end up being the lunar phenomenon that the most ardent fans say it will be, but I'm happy to see that the company will have a second chance at life thanks to the likes of Ryan Cohen.

What kind of uncontrollable things might affect your company? This year, everyone with their eyes glued on semiconductors has gotten a lesson in Taiwanese climatology. Turns out water is pretty important to TSM's bottom line.

Go to Finviz and look at the chart for your stock. Is now a good time to buy? Does it look like it's at a temporary peak and volume is decreasing? Maybe hold off. Is the RSI over 70? Just wait a few days and pick it up at a discount. On the other hand, does it look like it's hit a bottom, bounced, hit the same bottom, bounced, and hit the bottom again? Now might be a good time to buy in that case. Check out the moving averages too... 20 day MACD shooting up over the 50 day is good news for bulls, 20 day MACD falling down below the 50 day is good news for bears.

While you're at Finviz, take a look at what analysts are saying about the target price of that stock. It's not that the analysts are always right, it's that people often listen to them. 

Ok, now price to earnings is a little controversial. Historically, a ratio of 39 or higher was considered bearish (see the crash of 1929 for more details), but due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in due to the pandemic, speculation is higher than normal right now and for the moment that's ok. Once we start reopening fully, if a company's price to earnings stays ridiculously high, that's not a great sign. Take a look at a bunch of car companies like Ford, Toyota, GM, etc. Check out their price to earnings. Then look at Tesla. The Tesla fan excuse is that TSLA is not purely a car company. If you want to buy a stock with some weirdness going on with the price, make sure you have put some thought into why it might be inflated.

Let's talk about the options chain. I know, you just want to buy shares, but the options chain will let you know if people are anticipating big moves in either direction. Compare the ratio of puts to calls to get a feel for how people expect the stock to move. Of course, they could all just be wrong and theta gang wins again...

Finally, check the news about your stock. Google news search is your friend.","['GOOGL', 'GM', 'TSLA']"

mz8dh1,,stocks,post,1619472098,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 26, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 26, 2021**

The stock traded mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) continuing strong momentum from last week while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly fell. Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Last week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.

For simplification, and because on [page 6 of the 10-k for 2020 it is listed as the primary source of revenue](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001801368/7c83b453-4580-4c19-935a-5d198af27e58.pdf) this analysis will focus on Neodymium-Praseodymium (NdPr) for the forecasting.  Now we can [find the Q4 production yield in the annual results presentation easier](https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf) so it gives a production volume of 9,337 MT of ore - an 8% YoY gain.  But they do project modest gains for the full year on slide 11, so for this analysis I'll keep it steady.  

But that part isn't interesting, what is interesting is [I found a source which gives the historical price of REOs by element](https://www.kitco.com/strategic-metals/).  This is a really great source because now we can find the average price of NdPr over both Q4 and Q1 and get a scaling factor.  The last piece is cost - because the cost of production will be the same assuming a flat production rate, and because the overhead costs have no reason to change, we can assume the costs for Q1 should stay relatively constant.

With all that in mind, [I compiled the data to find the average price of NdPr](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5HiTyzSbs7v7xsNUM-YF-lY1LEEG9VwYUIqFtdPy0E/edit#gid=0) over Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, and it just blew me away - NdPr is 50% more expensive in Q1!  So with that in mind, a little bit of math will tell the EPS:  

## Q4 2020
Costs: 18M

Sales: 42M

Net Revenue: 24M for EPS of $0.14 

## Q1 2021

Costs: 18M

Sales: 67.4M

Net Revenue: 46.7M for EPS of $0.27

## Analyst Estimates and Price Targets

[This EPS kills the high analyst estimate of $0.10 and average of $0.08 for Q1](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates).  Now with those analysts giving a price target (making an assumption it is the same set of analysts, let me know if this isn't a good assumption), the high target price is 52.  By beating the high target by 2.7x, what do you think will happen after killing earnings by that much?  

Even for those of you who don't think analyst estimates and price targets are worth a damn, I went ahead and also calculated the annual EPS given a low ball 2% increase in production per quarter after Q1 and even reducing the price of NdPr to the mean of the Q1 2021 and Q4 2020 price.  Again - lowball - but the annual EPS came out to just shy of $1.  

Why does this matter?  They are still finishing their stage II plant meant to process the ore, then stage III to create finished products.  They will be a vertically integrated production facility enabling a massive increase in potential profit.  So that $1 EPS now is just the beginning, but they are (1) profitable now and (2) flush with cash after the share offering and green bond a few weeks ago.  And with the global demand for electric cars alone, there will be plenty of money to be made for the foreseeable future!

N.B. - The EPS from Q4 does not include non-recurring items, specifically a $66.6M fee to end an existing contract.  So when I say profitable, I'm talking about recurring costs.  

## Threats 

Yes, China flooding the market is a threat.  But considering Shengde, a Chinese company, owns 15% of MP - to me that minimizes that risk and honestly makes for a strong partnership until they get their stage III plant up and running.  Add to this, China's demand for REOs is also skyrocketing, the bigger threat might be China cutting off the US to only supply their own manufacturers.

Edit - Forgot to disclose my positions: Long MP, got assigned one CSP at a cost basis of 41, but bought a few hundred shares and a handful of June 18th 30c and 35c when it was around $28.  Currently sitting at an unrealized profit of $2,700 so not just some bag holder :)",['BLL']

I was thinking about entering into VNO, because it seems like a great value play for the long term. VNO owns properties In New York, chicago and san Fransisco I believe. But in my reading I stumbled upon that office real estate is a very fractured market and no player owns very large amounts of the total office space in any one city, making it very competitive.

It seems VNO is not doing great because of covid due to their focus on New York properties, but I usually like to buy value stocks going into weakness because they don't have a lot of upside priced in. Should I do the same style when I invest in reits?

mysz54,,stocks,post,1619425918,"Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE)JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose ""enormous competitive threats"" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them “taking over and revolutionizing banking” with “a wholesale transition” of “a $16 trillion market cap”.

In this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:

&#x200B;

Common bear arguments:

\#1 Old business

\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat

\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult

\#4 No growth

\#5 Slow growth

\#6 Not profitable

\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.

\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell

\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.

&#x200B;

\#1) Old business. 

Paysafe’s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Much of Paysafe’s business is in back-end payment processing so most don’t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method” and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Paysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They’ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Aside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service. 

In preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun & Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.

As Chairman Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab…I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. 

&#x200B;

\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. 

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe’s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,“a fortress. It’s got a moat… We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise."" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion ""unbanked"" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors

From SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: “To be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“To be a winner in this space, you’re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That’s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we’ve entered.”

&#x200B;

\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. 

Synergistic inorganic growth through M&A is a key pillar of Paysafe’s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” (2, 4)

&#x200B;

\#4) No growth. 

It’s true that Paysafe’s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev

2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)

2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).

2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, “exited low value referral channels” and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

—Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

— Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.

&#x200B;

\#5) Slow growth. 

Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe’s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.

Analyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”

In the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:

1 ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

2 ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""

3 New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

4 ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""

5 ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

6 ”Delaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March""

7 ""Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%""

8 “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL""

10 “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling”

11 “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting”

12 “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear”

13 “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools”

14 ""Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization""

15 “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal”

16 “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think“

&#x200B;

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

&#x200B;

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Notes:

1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.

2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.

3 As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.

4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.

&#x200B;

\#6) Not profitable. 

Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, “Paysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company’s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.”
These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:

Repay: -0.67,

Affirm : -2.18,

Nuvei : -1.08,

Paysign : -0.19.

Bill : -0.62,

Shift4 : -0.43

Average EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69
If you read their transcripts and presentations, you’ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They’ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.

&#x200B;

\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   
Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity’s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”

Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: “Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.” 

Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:

Square: 77.8X

Repay : 8.7X

Fiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X

GPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X

Shift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA

Affirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA

Paysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA

Bill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA

Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe’s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they’ll be able to fund M&A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.

&#x200B;

\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. 

The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it’s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.

Importantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley’s time-tested M&A playbook.

Blackstone itself says (9), “The term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.” With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”

In a recent interview Foley said, private equity’s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the table…All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.”

The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand his both his M&A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the “The Foley Network” (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity’s massive transactional volume). In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, “The thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it’s a great asset.”

Besides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn’t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe’s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square’s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.

&#x200B;

\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. 

According to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.

Importantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.

Total FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 % 

Blackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 % 

CVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 % 

Other Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 % 

Cannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 % 

PIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 % 

723,734,536 100.0 % 

Below are some examples of the warrant cashless conversion rates per the chart in the S1 (7). Cash redemption is more profitable when commons trade above $18. 

$18 : $6.50

$17 : $6.08 

$16 : $5.57

$15 : $5.05

$14 : $4.54

$13 : $4.04 

&#x200B;

Despite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of “fake sell walls” and HFS “short ladder attacks” as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. 

I think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for “sticky” customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.

&#x200B;

Note: Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe’s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:

$360 million revenue

$220 million gross profit

$105 million EBITDA

mznz36,,stocks,post,1619528597,"Are all pension providers a scam?Now i'm just a dumb ape, but I have been trying to educate myself on the ways of the world financial. Here in the UK we have some kind of auto-enrollment workplace pension scheme where you start a job, you get a side-along pension pot with whatever random pension provider that company chooses into which funds are deposited. I suspect i'm not alone in my generation of largely ignoring this obscure financial thingy and have never made any attempts to manage these pension funds, so i started looking in to consolidating various pots and finding how my money is invested.

My main pot is with a company called 'Nest Pensions'. Their highest performing fund is bizarrely called '**Sharia fund** - A fund with an investment approach based on Islamic law'.... ok, what ever, but it's weird to me a company i never chose to invest my money focuses heavily on islamic banking?

So i'm trying to find details of what fund i'm in and how my money is invested, except my fund isn't listed in their [Quarterly Investment Report - Q4 2020](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/dam/nestlibrary/61537-QIR-Q4-2020-210223.pdf) 

For some reason, they only list the 'Nest 2040 retirement fund'. Ok, that's great, but how is my fund performing and what is it invested in?

So here I am reading their '[Statement of investment principles](https://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/dam/nestlibrary/SIP-Mar20-Mar23.pdf)' document.



Which states:

>14.2 The foundation phase refers to the early years of younger scheme members’ working lives as they develop the savings habit. This phase typically lasts five years. The objective for the foundation phase is to keep pace with CPI after all charges.

>14.3 The growth phase is where the maximum growth in assets is being targeted through investing in asset classes that are expected to grow in value relative to inflation more than other investments. The objective for this phase is to outperform CPI plus 3 per cent a year after all charges over the long term.

**Am I reading this correctly, or is the operation of this company to make as little money as possible for 0-20 years? wtf?**

If i was a pension provider, i would take that money, let's say £1000, invest it wherever I want with let's say a ridiculous yolo £1000 return, but oh dear, sniff sniff, poor 0-5 year investor only gets 2% of that money, a whooping extra £20, and i bank £980. Is this legal? How is this legal?

**Wtf is the point of investing money to literally make no money?**",
mznz36,gw1o360,stocks,comment,1619528881,"These type of pension funds are based on your age, closer to retirement, they shift their focus from stocks to bonds / cash deposits, to reduce risk, it’s common in these type of funds, Vanguard has one for every year for the next 50 or so years.

mz30vx,,stocks,post,1619458120,"Roblox is worth twice as much as Take-two InteractiveI'm genuinely curios, maybe someone more knowledgeable around here can explain this to me. How come that Take-two Interactive (Rockstar games) is currently valued at 20 billions, while Roblox is valued at 40 billions? I don't know much about valuing a company based on financials and stuff, and i can definitely see the value of ROBLOX, but comon, GTA is a way more established IP that is definitely going to keep growing in the coming years (well, just my opinion of course), while ROBLOX feels like a waaaaay weaker brand, with less history and less future growth.

mz30vx,gvydhqn,stocks,comment,1619459276,""" while ROBLOX feels like a waaaaay weaker brand, with less history and less future growth ""  


So my impression (granted I'm not a child, don't use RBLX and don't know too much about the company) is that it is a totally different type of platform than GTA/games. I think its like an online social platform for coding/games... So think like TikTok meets games, but the kids can code the games themselves. So all the games they have are made by their users.   


The other thing is saying ""waaaay weaker brand"" is tough because I think this is a trend and has huge potential - over 1/2 of 16 year olds in the US played on the platform last year (which is insane).

It's just been cratering. I know there were a lot of issues with Cyberpunk (issues which speak to major internal problems) but they have still made a ton of money on it. I guess I'm wondering if someone knows something I don't before I do a deep dive. I mean, is the reputational hit of one bad release worth this much of a hit to the stock?",
mzfbtl,gw0lyy6,stocks,comment,1619498737,It's not so much that the stock was hit. It's just that it had been pumped up to silly levels before the release. Considering the disastrous launch CDR is fairly valued at about 140-160 zl,
mzfbtl,gw0ms2v,stocks,comment,1619499317,Pink sheets are trouble,
mzfbtl,gw1bbkt,stocks,comment,1619520682,"A few quick thoughts because I am also considering jumping in:

- the cyberpunk release was a complete disaster; not only was the game unplayable for console gamers, but it was nowhere near what was promised, they were actively misleading players
- the release was too early, because they wanted it to be out by christmas and before next gen consoles so that people might buy the game twice
- the negative press might be shortlived, but their reputation definetly took a hit (+ they got hacked)
- they had to do a complete strategy update with organizational restructurings
- the multiplayer was basically cancelled (they explicitly said they want to focus on singleplayer rpgs)
- they don't have another huge release in their pipeline afaik (I heard they were working on something on the side, but I don't know what)

So yeah, sure the stock got slaughtered, but for good reasons. It was overpriced, because the hype around cyberpunk was too crazy. I mean what do you expect from a game that was 8 years in development? 

Don't get me wrong, I love buying when there is blood in the streets, but CDPR has some fundamental proplems that will take time to get solved. I see no real catalysts for the near future. 

With all that in mind, is the market currently overreacting? I don't know.

myo8zn,gvw3we0,stocks,comment,1619407810,"Love this question as that's essentially all that investing is about. To me the price movement each day should not have an effect on your decision to add/subtract to your position unless the movement itself is a symptom of a newly revealed issues with the company.

Presumably once you have decided that a company is undervalued, you want to build a position that you are comfortable with and stop. Some people think that technical analysis can be helpful to find an entry point (I don't subscribe to tech analysis, but to each his own). I myself will build a position immediately if I truly think that a company is undervalued at market price. This is because if the company is truly undervalued, it's statically likely that every passing day gives it a chance to ""revert to the means."" And this seems true btw, for every undervalued stocks I bought, it took about 2-3 quarters or less for the stock to show outsized gains compared to the index. Remember that your time dedicated to do DD about a company is also valuable. Why waste that value on the hope that the stock would fall even further?

So, if the price drops, you want to find out why. Does anything change with the company that affects your DD. If so, maybe the new lower price is justified. If the price goes up, does it have to do with good news that were not part of your original DD. If so, maybe the new higher price is justified.

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**

I’ve basically been working on trying to build a monthly income from high yielding monthly paying dividends and just wanted some clarification on workings and whether the below would work. 

I have downloaded a spreadsheet of all the monthly dividend paying companies, and work out the best value for money based on dividend yield and price. 

Appreciate there will be some price differences between the below and current as this was put together some time ago. I also understand that dividend payments can change and price fluctuations could effect income and P/L. I also understand that using this method may not draw out the ‘best’ companies.

So does this mean for roughly $97,000 I can get paid roughly $720 per month?

**I’m from the UK so it basically translates to £71k for roughly £570 per month.**

The plan is to slowly build the portfolio, one stock at a time achieving the total number of shares to provide roughly £100pm, reinvesting the dividends as I go. I will eventually (if achieved) continue to add more ‘secure companies’ paying monthly/quarterly dividends stocks (AT&T Etc). 

Just wanted to know peoples thoughts, risks, advantages / disadvantages and whether this would be feasible. 

Thanks!",

While a 7%+ dividend sounds nice, it doesn't really mean much if the share price is dropping every month.

I would try to find more solid companies that have been paying steady dividends for years (commonly known as dividend aristocrats).  The dividend rate won't be as high, but the companies are a lot more stable.",

mzf9rs,,stocks,post,1619493379,"Question on Diagonal SpreadsSo, I'm a newer person into investing and most of my interest is with options and I'm seeking to turn this into a primary source of income. I've been looking into stuff like the wheel strategy and poor mans covered calls (I believe they are Diagonal Spreads?) and my question is a simple one. I mostly already got the gist on how they work, I think. To make sure I'm the right page, for a poor mans covered call, you basically buy a far out, in the money call, and then as a second leg, you sell a call out of the money and closer to expiration. My question is, that in the event you DO fuck up, and get assigned on the short call, it's supposed to use the long call to cover the short call, would I gain the difference in the strikes, or does it all just go poof? Like, if my long call is at a strike of 8, and my short call is at a strike of 14, it moons, and I get assigned. Do I get the $600 out of that, or is it just all lost? If it depends on broker, I use TD Ameritrade. I feel like it's probably an obvious answer, but doesn't hurt to be too careful about it. ",['LEG']
mzf9rs,gw0emdw,stocks,comment,1619493984,Yes you get the $600. You end up being short shares at $14 and you cover by exercising your option to buy at $8. Rarely would you get exercised except close to expiry and even then it’s rare.,

First, doesn't sound like you have a plan/goal when you're buying.   Take $CRSP for example.   Did you buy it to own it, or to trade it?  If to trade it, what was your target profit??  Having a plan going in allows you to be less reactive to the ebs and flows.

Second, if something gaps up way past where you thought it would be/above your target price for profit,  but you think it's got more room to run, you can always take your cost basis off the table and let the rest run.   That way you're guaranteed profit, maybe less than what you planned if it drops, but you still have exposure if it continues to run.  And again, since you covered your cost, it's all house money, so it should be a little less of an emotional experience.

I get that GOOGL is a high dollar stock, so one share can immediately throw off allocations.  But AAPL doesn't need to. 

IMO, I'd rather see you buy 1 share of GOOGL (get the class A stock) @ $2317, then 9 shares of AAPL at a total of around $1150 and maybe 5 shares of HON to help balance you out a bit more

One thing she has told me many times is that her pensions, minimum distributions and other things are producing too much cash such that there is just a shitload of uninvested cash sitting in an account producing basically zero gains. She was recently saying she got an email from some money market fund warning the interest might soon go negative thereby losing money. Im young so I Love some risky ventures but thats probably not really what they are looking for. my mom says she has auto deposits enabled for some investments that I don't know about to buy twice a month or so. she is thinking like should I stop or hold back incase the market takes a downturn at some point. 



My question is if you are fucking flush with cash and cant figure out what to do with it. Why wouldn't you put it into something barely risky like just a sp500 etf or something. if you really have more money than you know what to put it into then dont you by default have plenty of  room to make more volotile investments.????

I know variance is the risk of a stock / portfolio but what is standard deviation supposed to represent? Cause if it is just the square root of variance then why should I even calculate it if I can just worry about lowering my variance? Thanks, also sorry if the question is confusing to read, I’m not sure how else to word it.",
mz30vz,gvyeoef,stocks,comment,1619459776,"I’ve helped teach statistics at the graduate level and have tutored college students professionally. Your question is more or less how to detangle variance and standard deviation.

I’ll keep this simple. I’m cutting corners on showing all the math. 

Imagine if you had a small array of 5 numbers. The mean of this array was calculated as X (the exact number doesn’t matter in this example). 
Let’s determine how far away from the mean each of the 5 numbers in your array are: -3, -1, 0, +1, +3 (pulling this out of the air for example’s sake). In other words, one of your five numbers is 3 integers below the mean. Another is 1 under. Another is exactly equal to the mean. Another is 1 above. The last is 3 above. If you had to sum the total difference each number in the array was from the mean, you would get zero. Try adding -3, -1, 0, +1, and +3. But how do you show there were difference between each number and the mean? Well...you can square these differences.

So with the example, we can square -3 to get +9. square -1 to get +1. Etc.
If you square the differences between each number in the array from the mean   and add them together (sum of squares), you found the variance. Variance works because numbers squared are always positive. But this number is much larger than what we were dealing with (Again, look at a difference of -3 becoming +9). The variance can be reduced by taking the square root. This is why Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance. This is why we use SD because it sort of recalibrated the scale and numbers used.

This has applications in stocks for stuff like price and volatility.",
mz30vz,gvycfbh,stocks,comment,1619458825,"Same thing, different units. Variance is average deviations from the mean of all data points. Standard deviation is the square root of variance (like you said)... the measure of dispersion... so if the standard deviation of a set of observations is 10... that means that 68% of the observations in that group are within 10 of the mean (+10/-10).  


I think its just a preference - if you're a finance major you're learning about modern portfolio theory and they quote variance instead of std dev",
mz30vz,gvyc4g1,stocks,comment,1619458697,"> The calculation of variance uses squares because it weighs outliers more heavily than data closer to the mean. This calculation also prevents differences above the mean from canceling out those below, which would result in a variance of zero.

> Because of this squaring, the variance is no longer in the same unit of measurement as the original data. Taking the root of the variance means the standard deviation is restored to the original unit of measure and therefore much easier to interpret.",
mz30vz,gvyfts5,stocks,comment,1619460267,"STDEV is the average distance from the mean.

Variance is STDEV squared.

The reason Variance is squared is to remove the +/- from the equation, because if we just add the individual differences from the mean we'd get 0.

While I have been investing in various stocks since junior high, I've made multiple profit and losses(including a recent GME investment caused by r/wallstreetbets) and learned some important lessons: it is always important to look long-term in order to accumulate wealth.

My ultimate plan is to create a $40M \~ amount of wealth from the investment while successfully building up my career as a Cybersecurity researcher - a job with an entry-level wage of  $50K and goes up to $200K at maximum once become a senior-level employee.

Currently, I'm planning to invest in CIBR(Cybersecurity ETF), TECL(Tech 3X ETF), FAL(Financial sector 3X ETF) and hedge the risk by investing 20% in VIXY(VIX index fund). According to my calculation using efficient frontier(which I learned from college econ class), an optimal portfolio creates an annual return of 35% with bearable risk.

Mimedx (MDXG)My largest holding reports earnings this week with a conference call Thursday morning before Market open. Mimedx has developed Best in Class advanced wound care products from dehydrated human amnion chorion membrane (dHACM) derived from donated placental tissue. With respect to Advanced wound care applications, these products are used to care for difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers/venous foot ulcers, and for the repair of surgical and other hard to heal wounds (including amputations, dental extractions, and for healing burns without or with only minimal scarring). Reimbursement for Mimedx advanced wound care products was recently approved by the nation's  largest commercial  payor, United Health.

Mimedx is a turnaround play, with an entirely new Board and Management and their Advanced wound care products with 85% gross margins are alone worth the price of admission. But the real potential gamechanger for this company is its micronized injectable products for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.  Phase IIb trial for knee osteoarthritis and Phase III trial for plantar fasciitis are underway with data expected soon. All indications are that the data will show meaningful efficacy with no adverse risks. Other potential indications include shoulders, elbows, hips, etc. Medically, this is an area of great unmet need and Mimedx's Amniofix Injectable product has been given Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation status by the FDA wifh the potential to speed up the approval process. The potential market for these products, if approved, is in the billions annually.

mz3gdq,,stocks,post,1619459248,"Market data API that provides International Market data? (The price of a stock located on several Exchanges)Hi all, 

I [posted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/myeiqu/where_do_market_websites_get_their_realtime/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about where market websites get their data from. I really appreciate all of the responses. 

Today my question is about International Market Data APIs. I was informed of a few yesterday (Alpha Vantage, Factset, etc.) Do either of these have the ability of providing quotes for securities listed internationally (in several countries)? 

Example: [https://www.tradingview.com/](https://www.tradingview.com/) 

If you look up a security (Alibaba for example) on their website, you are able to find the price of that security in several countries it is listed in (Russia, China, U.S., etc.). Does anyone have any idea of what API/program they would be using to accomplish this? I appreciate any and all help. Thank you!

""While Tesla has navigated a myriad of Chinese government PR issues,  chip shortages, and a further spotlight on its auto pilot safety record  (given the Texas crash) over the past month, the Street is now laser  focused on gauging the annual delivery trajectory for 2021,"" previews  analyst Dan Ives.

The German world-wide wholesale retailer Metro AG: $MTTWF (or $B4B in Germany) is overlooked in my opinion.

$MTTWF was originally founded in 1964 and has grown to operate across 26 countries. It was spun-off from $MTTRY in 2017 and the share price has been falling ever since.

$MTTWF shows stable revenue from wholesale (2017 - 2018 dip was because they stopped reporting the hypermarket department revenue, sold in 2020). The wholesaler is leading the pack in multiple countries, and is growing in other countries.

It’s been trading side-ways with 5 - 6 P/E lately so I’ve done some comparison between $MTTWF and $WMT. $WMT is financially doing 20x better than $MTTWF (possibly due to business model diversity + dominating the US market). However, the market cap of $WMT is almost 100x that of $MTTWF

Assuming $WMT is trading at fair value today, doesn’t this entail that $MTTWF is massively undervalued (20% - 30% of fair value)?

Position: I own 572 shares of METRO AG as of today, and got some spare cash incase of a dip

They have to be authorized to increase shares for doing it but that doesn't necessarily mean they plan on raising the maximum, or necessarily any at all. Sort of like cash buybacks, the company will be authorized to spend $x on buybacks but they can chose to do so at their discretion.

&nbsp;

The [items of business](https://i.imgur.com/5wxsOvY.png) for the meeting include an approval from stakeholders to allow the company to **increase the number of authorized shares of common stocks**. This is what is called a [share dilution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp). 

Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 — Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock **from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares** https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png

&nbsp;

>Description of the Proposed Amendment
Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to **increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the
proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock
for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for
adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.**

...

>If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the
date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

...

>As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed
Amendment **would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for**
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, *expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,
including shares we would be obligated to issue* **in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited**; stock
dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional
capital. Such issuances would occur **without further action or approval of our stockholders** and would be subject to and
limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.

...

>Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the
potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.

...

>**The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval** of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.

- they make a [statement regarding the pending acquisition of ARM](https://i.imgur.com/bk38IIf.png); TLDR; they put a downpayment on it; they say it will happen, and they give an estimate for Q1 2022. also, softbank get paid lotsa $$ and shares. if it doesn't happen for whatever reasons, the company *may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell products*
- they specialize in the [gaming, professional visualisation \(VR\), data center, and automotive industries](https://i.imgur.com/b4unjGl.png);  gaming & data center 🚀
- they talk about [risks and risk strategy](https://i.imgur.com/3ROHfMe.png); they are reliant on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. to manufacture our semiconductors

Please go through the document by yourselves (link at the top). I am not experienced, nor that smart. I did not read everything in the document.

I am thinking to vote for approval of proposal 4. In my opinion it is good for the long term. Please remember you are responsible for your own financial decisions. I hold a low amount of shares, and I'll be holding for the long term.

Edit: today's green day brought the price above the resistance line at $614.24. Consolidation in the 600-640 area looks good for the next 2 weeks, unless news catalysts. I am not experienced so make of this what you will.

Stock futures are flat this morning. Nothing doing at all really. Yesterday all but the Dow Industrials were positive and the S&P and Nasdaq closed at new record highs..

It should be a busy day with plenty of earnings to move things along. As I write this, UPS just came in with a beat on earnings and revenues. That’s another good sign for the economy. During market hours we’ll hear from 3M, Hasbro, JetBlue, Starbucks, Wynn Resorts, and others. After the close it will be Google/Alphabet, AMD, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, and Visa. Many others as well but those are the ones that have my attention.

We also have the start of the Fed meetings today, but shouldn’t be hearing very much from that until tomorrow.

Stocks have been quietly ‘melting up’ for awhile. That may accelerate. Commodities are cranking along, with copper, wheat, corn, soybeans, and coffee at or near multi-year highs. The ‘soft commodities’ (wheat, corn, soybeans) are particularly frothy. Check out the charts if you have a chance.

Until the inflation narrative takes hold and forces the Fed to start tapering it should still be all systems go for risk assets. Some earnings disappointments notwithstanding of course.","['MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'MMM', 'SBUX', 'UPS', 'SPGI', 'TXN', 'AMD', 'WYNN', 'NDAQ', 'DOW']"

I also get why the value of municipal bonds would vary with the market and interest rates.

With a difference of 2% growth rates over the next 20 years there can be massive differences in the end value of your investment.


The historical CAGR (with dividends) of the S&P500 over the last X years (ending Dec 31 2020) is as follows:

100 Years: 10.46%

90: 9.92%

80: 11.23%

70: 11.54%

60: 10.27%

50: 10.76%

40: 12.01%

30: 10.24%

20: 6.59%

10: 13.99%

Source: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm


Knowing this, what do you assume the broad market will have for an annualized growth rate over the next 20 years or so? I'm thinking along the lines of the total S&P500 return, VTSAX, or similar. Why?


I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more. Second, I think macroeconomic headwinds are coming compared to the previous decades that will result in slower overall growth.",['SPGI']

After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this?

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR']

Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Aetna common stock is being exchanged for $145.00 in cash and ***0.8378 shares of CVS*** Health common stock.  CVS Health is not issuing any fractional shares in the transaction. Instead, the total number of shares of CVS Health common stock that each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive is being rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive cash for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that the Aetna shareholder is otherwise entitled to receive.

The transaction values Aetna at $212 per share or approximately $70 billion. Including the assumption of Aetna’s debt, the total value of the transaction is $78 billion. The combined company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CVS.” The Aetna brand name will continue to be used in reference to the health insurance products. Going forward, Aetna will operate as a standalone business within the CVS Health enterprise and will be led by members of its current management team.

\*\*Introduction\*\*

&#x200B;

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a concept where financial products are available on a public decentralized blockchain network making them open to anyone to use rather than going through a middleman like banks or brokerages. Unlike fiat-based banks or brokerage accounts, a government-issued ID, SIN number, and/or proof of address are not necessarily required to use DeFi. More specifically, DeFi refers to a system where software written on blockchains makes it possible for buyers, sellers, lenders, and borrowers to interact peer-to-peer, or with a strictly software-based middleman, rather than a company or institution facilitating a transaction.

&#x200B;

A cryptocurrency is a standard currency used for making or receiving secure payments on a blockchain, with the most popular cryptocurrency being Bitcoin (as of April 2021). The cryptocurrency is the superset while altcoins (and crypto tokens) are two subset categories.

&#x200B;

Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies that were launched after the massive success achieved by Bitcoin. The term means alternative coins—that is—other than bitcoins. They were launched as enhanced substitutes of bitcoin with the claims to overcome some of the pain points of Bitcoin. 

&#x200B;

Cryptocurrencies and altcoins are essentially specific virtual currencies that have their own dedicated blockchains and are primarily used as a medium for digital payments. On the other hand, crypto tokens operate on top of a blockchain that acts as a medium for the creation and execution of decentralized apps and smart contracts, and the tokens are used to facilitate the transactions. In summary, coins are native to their own blockchain, whereas tokens are built on top of another blockchain.

&#x200B;

\*\*Risk\*\* 

&#x200B;

Compared to the traditional fiat market, the crypto market is extremely volatile. All crypto investing should be considered gambling, to a greater degree than regular fiat market investing. To mitigate the risk inherent in crypto investing, do enough research that you understand that in which you are investing. 

&#x200B;

The golden rule of cryptocurrency is: don’t invest more than you are willing to lose. Cryptocurrency should be part of the “fun money” allocation in your overall investment portfolio. Prior to investing in crypto, ask yourself “would I be okay with losing all of this money?”.

&#x200B;

The cryptocurrency industry is currently minimally regulated. However, this may change in the future. It would be prudent to undertake all activities with a view that information regarding your trades/gains/losses/etc. may all eventually be shared with the government. Activities like day trading may seem profitable in the short term, however profits should be withheld to cover the costs of income tax on capital gains, just as any realized profits from regular fiat trading would be subject to.  

&#x200B;

\*\*Due Diligence\*\*

&#x200B;

Not all crypto coins and tokens are created equally. Just as you would with a fiat investment, do your due diligence researching the fundamentals of a crypto coin before investing in it. Choose coins that pass the due diligence checklist below. Steer clear of “shitcoins”  (knock-off, get-rich-quick coins) or “meme stonks” (coins currently experiencing short-term internet fame)  whose underlying fundamentals don’t pass the sniff test.

&#x200B;

\*\*Questions to ask when considering whether to invest in a crypto coin or token:\*\*

&#x200B;

\- Review use cases, utility, and size of potential market. Is it needed? Which problem is it trying to solve? What is it trying to achieve? Does it use blockchain, and is it implemented correctly? Who are the biggest competitors (usually not other coins, but other companies/corporations)? How crowded is that space? How do they stack up compared to competition? Original vs. copycat? Would a certain platform still be able to run without this coin?

\- Check total market cap, “tokenomics” (token economics), and 24 hour trading volume. How many coins/tokens are there in circulation? How much of the volume is organic vs. synthetic (purchased by founders)? What could make the token increase/decrease in value? Watch out for “whales” (investors with huge market share whose trading actions can significantly influence the coin’s value). 

\- Review developer/advisor bios, communications, and marketing material. Who are the developers? Any partnerships? What is their background? How experienced are they? Does at least one of them have a strong background in internet security/privacy/IT? Is there a website? Are there contact points, such as a Discord group or Reddit AMA to answer questions and offer transparency? Be aware of anything guaranteeing returns.

\- Read the whitepaper and roadmap. Big words and empty promises are red flags. What is the plan for the future? Has the team achieved the initial goals outlined on their roadmap?

\- Try to gauge reputation. What is the current market sentiment? Any previous scandals, pump-and-dumps, etc.? Be aware of shilling/hype/pump-and-dump schemes, and of exit scams/soft exits. 

\- Don’t chase the pump. Just because something is rocketing, doesn’t make it a good investment. 

\- Assess compatibility with your portfolio. What is the risk profile? Do you intend to HODL (hold long term) or swing trade? Will this fit with your overall investment goals? If you intend to swing trade, and long-term fundamentals are not important to you, is there an incentive/reward plan in place? What is your exit plan - i.e., when will you sell?

&#x200B;

\*\*Investing Platforms and Logistics\*\*

&#x200B;

Choose a reputable cryptocurrency platform that has low gas (trading) fees. It’s wise to choose a platform that allows for easy transferring to and from fiat currency; for example, via a pre-loaded balance credit credit card that can be used for purchases just like a traditional credit card, but which can be topped up using cryptocurrency or fiat.

&#x200B;

When you are ready to transfer your fiat currency to a crypto platform to begin investing, send a dummy transaction prior to sending all of your money. 

&#x200B;

Just like any investment, buy the dip, but don’t fixate on timing the market. Never FOMO in impulsively because you are afraid prices will continue to rocket and you’ll miss your chance to get in at a reasonable price. Dips come and go more frequently with crypto than fiat, and chances are you will have another dip in the near future during which you can buy in. If you are planning a big buy, know that prices often dip on Sundays… though the past is not a predictor of the future.

&#x200B;

Set personal limits and boundaries. The crypto market is open 24/7. Resist the temptation of checking your investments constantly at all hours of the day (and night). 

&#x200B;

At tax time, remember that cryptocurrency transactions are subject to the same income tax rules as fiat currency (e.g., claiming capital gains and losses). Governments are just starting to tap into and regulate the crypto market, so assume that you will eventually have to share all of your crypto trading information, even if this isn’t currently the case. 

&#x200B;

i’ve been building my roth ira for the past few weeks using my saved up salary. my plan is to have an extremely aggressive portfolio as i’m still very young and can afford to lose money short term. so far i have $4k put into the ira, so only $2k left for 2021. i make just over $200 a week from my job and my current expenses are quite low so i’ll have the money to finish it in no time. here’s my allocations so far:

42% ARKK

38% VOO (0% contributed yet)

10% ARKX

5% VXUS

5% VWO

i haven’t put any money into VOO yet, as it’s the remaining $2k and i wanted to diversify a little before dumping money into the s&p 500. 

am i on the right track? part of me thinks i’m an idiot for owning the shares i own and part of me thinks in 40 years i’ll consider myself a genius...","['ARKK', 'SPGI']"

However, I disagree with both. I think you can time both, but it's really about making sure you're not overpaying for assets.

For example, if you look in the stock market you will find some stocks that are still a good value despite the overall market 100% being in a bubble. The same goes for real estate. There are probably some real estate markets that will grow quite well over the next 5-10 years. I'm thinking the states where there is no income tax is a good example of good markets in general.

my953u,,investing,post,1619360105,"Feedback post: we're considering revising/specifying the rules on advice/spitball postsThe moderation pendulum swings all over the place, but I fear it's a bit too far on constricting right now.  We haven't actually changed any of our base rules, but have tightened up on some in the post GME deluge of dumb posts. 

I know /u/greytoc just made a post on DD guidelines, we're just about ready to roll out some new firm guidelines on what DD is appropriate and what is not.  So stay tuned for that.  

So, that said the volume of posts has decreased significantly here, a lot are being removed for very good reasons, but we're still thinking of ways to strike a nice balance (to be clear - quality of discussion is and will continue to be our primary goal with any rule).  I regularly check the automod removal logs and 99% of the posts being removed are frankly just really generic advice requests or basic questions. 

That said, I'd like to formulate some formal guidelines for differentiating between a post that should be in a daily thread and one that can have it's own thread.  I'd like for sufficiently complex topics to be able to generate insightful discussion - this is an inherently subjective threshold so someone's gonna be mad about their post not making the cut, but I think formalizing some guidelines should help.  

So, I was discussing this with /u/Emc87, and our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here.  But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.  

This obviously creates a lot of room for interpretation - I've seen enough people in modmail arguing that ""how do I buy stock"" is a valid discussion topic that would help many people to know that we're not going to make everyone happy here.  But I would like to see what thoughts everyone has as to putting a semi-formal framework on these ideas, so that we can point to something when deciding which posts will be sent to the daily threads and which can have their own post.",['GOOGL']

mym15t,,investing,post,1619398704,"Tax it now? Or tax it later?I’ve always heard the order of investing for retirement should go as follows:
Contribute to Employer Tax Deferred Plan up to the match amount
Max out Roth IRA
Back to Employer Plan and max it out
Contribute to Taxable accounts

That’s what we’ve been working on for the last three years. My wife has a 403(b) and a Roth IRA. I haven’t had an employee plan, so I’ve just been maxing out my Roth IRA and that’s it. 

I know the assumption people rely on for this plan is that their tax bracket in retirement will be higher than what it is now, hence taking the taxes now in lieu of taking them in retirement. 

I just got a job that offers a SIMPLE IRA (tax deferred account similar to 401(k)) with a 3% employer match. 

Our adjusted gross income last year (married filing jointly) was around 95k.

mym15t,gvxb4h5,investing,comment,1619442134,"The advice you've outlined is pretty common in /r/personalfinance which tends to be skewed to young, early career, or pre-career demographics or people working in a career with limited/stagnated earnings. Roth is a good option for these workers because they tend to be in lower tax brackets now, but with potential for higher income in the future and in retirement. Additionally, Roth IRA's allow removal of contributions (but not growth) without penalty which provides flexibility in how the money is used which younger workers value. 

If you're an older, professional, mid/late career worker, in a career where earnings tend to increase with experience and responsibility, you will tend to get more benefit from pre-tax account contributions. These workers tend to be in higher tax brackets and have income that exceeds their planned retirement income. These workers should prioritize 401k, HSA. Deductible IRA contributions generally are not an option due to the low income cap. 

The rule of thumb I've seen is that if you're in the bottom two tax brackets you should prioritize after-tax accounts (Roth, Roth 401k). If you're above the bottom two tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax (401k, HSA) and after maxing these, use Roth IRA, then taxable accounts.",

mydjye,gvxq9vn,investing,comment,1619449452,"Look, you are free to disregard this, but I'm hoping to save you a lot of pain.  For what it's worth, I'm currently the CEO of a biotech startup that's raised $30MM.

If you don't meet the accredited investor definition (by wealth, not certification) and you're not playing an active role in managing whatever you're looking at investing in, at least one of the following are true: you should not be investing in that business, and if that business is interested in having you as an investor, *nobody* should be investing in it.

The rules are there to protect investors who can't afford to lose significant amounts of money from high-risk, illiquid investments where there are significant information gaps between investors and management due to the lack of formal reporting.  It's not just that you're risking money that may disappear; it's that you're doing it without the ability to have the market setting the price, analysts reviewing financials, and real due diligence.

Moreover, the rules are there because, to have you as an investor, these companies need you to invest *a lot* *more* than you could lose comfortably if you don't meet the thresholds.  When I raised the seed into my current company, minimum investment was $50k.  I wanted a clean cap table with investors who wouldn't be pinched if it took a long time to get out (on average, that's 5-10 YEARS) and who knew what they were signing up for.  A company who is ok with someone investing $5k-$10k that isn't a founder and is marginally accredited either a) isn't raising enough money to scale; b) is going to have a very messy cap table; or c) is delusional or lying about capital needs or business potential.  Likely all three.

If you want to get involved with exciting startup investments, go be a part of an exciting startup.  Start one yourself, or find some founders and offer to help, or just get a job at a startup.  But if you're not accredited, you shouldn't be investing in these things -- the potential for loss is massive and you're not going to have enough firepower or financial ballast to make much of a difference or weather the rough times.",

I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&P 500. This tends to outperform the S&P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.","['SPGI', 'LEG']"

mwvqvk,,investing,post,1619185962,"Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunityLeave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

mx1aby,,investing,post,1619201124,"My Alteryx (AYX) DD: This isn't a dip to buy, it's part of their long decline.After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to [instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664513-alteryx-shares-drop-after-chief-revenue-officer-resigns).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, [an analyst](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/alteryx-s-1-breakdown-4a711683f6c) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares.","['MMM', 'NDAQ']"

mx1aby,gvlz4xn,investing,comment,1619211146,"From a strategy/competition perspective I've always wondered how much potential Microsoft has to eat Alteryx's lunch. 

1. Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power BI can easily do all the of the same data transformation/modeling/blending/reporting without buying any licenses. It can't mimic Alteryx's data science packages but does any professional actually use those instead of python/R?
2. Alteryx has much friendlier UI/UX but the MS Office team has been doing an incredible job with Office 365 making it super user friendly and powerful. I could easily see them creating a slick O365 product for codeless data blending and analytics. Or just tie Power Apps, Flow, and Data Factory together into a single, simple UX. 
3. Adding an Alteryx copycat to the O365 family with out-of-the-box connectivity to all the other O365 services seems like a huge perk. Seamless integration between Excel, One Drive, Power BI, and Active Directory sounds super nice to me.

Anecdotally, I'm Alteryx Core certified and fluent in M and python. A lot of times for data transformation I'll go with power query just because the native Excel integration makes it quick and easy. For more advanced jobs I'll go to python for the flexibility. The only standout thing about Alteryx to me is its user friendliness which I think Microsoft is more than capable of matching at some point.","['MS', 'MSFT']"

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive. 

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price. 

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of  growth figures is required to get great returns.",['GOOGL']

mx7aye,,investing,post,1619218741,"Ideas for investing in growth in the sunbeltThe southern US is growing much faster than the rest of the US, especially places like the Phoenix MSA and Texas Triangle. Of the top 10 most populous cities in the US, the only four that have experienced more than 10% population growth in the past decade have been in Texas and Arizona. Austin in particular (#11th most populous US city) grew 24% in the past decade and is probably the hottest real estate market in the US right now. Anyone who lives in these areas, especially Texas, knows how how many people from places like California are going to Texas for cheaper CoL amongst other things. I'd provide links but I'm not sure if they'd get my post deleted by AutoMod - city/state growth is readily available.

That being said, real estate is the most obvious investment opportunity to profit off of this demographic shift. My only exposure to real estate as a 25 year old just starting my career is FundRise and REITs - FundRise has a clear focus on southern real estate, especially in TX, and with enough research you can find REITs (like MAA, CPT, BRT) that invest primarily in the sunbelt region.

Other ideas I've had are power/utilities companies like PNW. One might even combine this demographic perspective with climate change speculation - people are moving to hot places that are going to keep getting hotter; air conditioning stocks like CARR may be a good choice?

So form my perspective, I can only really think REITs/utilities/AC. I wanted to give my own two cents on how to profit off of this growth but also see if people here had other ideas as to specific sectors or stocks (or non-stock market ideas) and spark discussion. I'm also curious if people here have ideas for investing in other demographic trends such as aging population.","['CARR', 'MAA', 'PNW']"

Think of tobacco stocks having the opposite effect. Nobody wants to own them anymore so their multiples have collapsed and are likely to be perpetually “cheap”.

mwx0rd,,investing,post,1619189538,"Enbridge: Critical Infrastructure in the Green RevolutionThe green revolution is upon us. Enbridge is a critical energy infrastructure business known for transporting oil and natural gas. It also has a sizeable renewable segment. What you might not be aware of is how well that stacks up in the renewables space and how such companies are including non-renewable power in their total outputs.

For capacity context, the International Renewable Energy Agency released its [2020 Renewable Capacity Statistics ](https://www.irena.org/publications/2021/March/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2021)which provides insights into the sector as a whole.

 I have ranked Enbridge with various renewable companies in terms of **current net capacity** (the maximum output of electricity a generator can produce under ideal conditions) **minus natural gas capacity,** which[ according to the International Renewable Energy Agency is an alternative fossil fuel. ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Apr/IRENA_Report_GET_2018.pdf)Definitions for what constitute *renewable* natural gas vary and you will see further examples below, but this number is included where available. The only outputs considered are strictly renewable: solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. I have not included energy generation statistics (how much energy is actually output) because this varies based on operating capacity and conditions (eg. weather events will lower output).  


All data has been sourced from the latest publicly available ESG or Annual Reports and provided below. 

 

|**Company**|**Net Renewable Capacity (MW)**|
|:-|:-|
|Brookfield Renewable|18,884|
|Innergex Renewable|2,742|
|Boralex|2,455|
|Enbridge|1,727|
|Algonquin|1,456|
|Northland Power|1,323|
|Transalta Renewables|1,619\*\*|

\*\* \*\*Transalta Renewables as at Dec 31 2020 listed only gross renewable MW and not net, which is significantly lower. 

&#x200B;

 **Brookfield Renewable:** by far the largest output capacity and zero natural gas facilities. The majority of net capacity comes from Hydro and Wind. 

 **Innergex Renewable:** The majority of net capacity comes from Wind and Hydro. Again no natural gas. 

 **Boralex:** 82% of net capacity is derived from Wind. Least diversified of the group. 

 **Enbridge:** Majority of renewable capacity generated by Wind. Renewables represent 3% of EBITDA and appx. $200MM in annual contracted revenues. 

 Combined Current Renewable Power Generation outputs:  
• 1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;  
• 255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;  
• 80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation 

 **Algonquin**: The latest data from 2021 sources showed FY19 figures. You will see coal listed here: the Asbury coal plant was closed in March 2020. Furthermore, a significant portion of their capacity is from natural gas (50%), which is from non-renewable sources and thus not included. 

 **Northland Power:** Included in their total output is ‘efficient’ natural gas, which accounts for \~60% of net capacity. While the outcome is reduced emissions, it is still not a renewable source and therefore not included in total renewable capacity. 

 **Transalta Renewables:** Similar to Algonquin and Northland, a significant portion of capacity is from natural gas (\~60%). I was unable to find updated net capacity statistics, which are significantly lower than gross, thus TA ranked last. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net capacity is an important metric in measuring where a renewable company stands, but it is not the only one. Revenues are impacted by total output and pricing, of which the weather events in Texas provided an eye-opening example. Nevertheless, what we see from the above comparison is that Enbridge is already well positioned amongst common North American “renewable” names, albeit far behind big players like Brookfield. Looking through the above company ESG and Annual Reports highlighted further forays into traditional renewable sources, while also noting investments in **renewable natural gas**. Let’s not forget the critical role Enbridge will play in RNG transmission alongside their [own RNG production.](https://www.enbridgegas.com/Natural-Gas-and-the-Environment/Enbridge-A-Green-Future/Renewable-Natural-Gas) 

 Make of this information what you will. The market is currently discounting their business with the secular oil decline, and not fully considering Enbridge’s ability to innovate and partner alongside a growing global energy infrastructure network, particularly in the NG/RNG space. I am bullish.

mw4jei,,investing,post,1619097477,"PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendationsFor those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

32, turning 33 in July. United States. 

>Are you employed/making income? How much?

Unemployed, but unemployment is giving me 15/hr in a 40 hour equivalent period. 

>What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)

Retirement and make extra money. 

>What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

I want to retire at 65. About 32 years.

70% safe.

No debts or expenses. I currently have 15K in my savings account and 3K in my checking accounts. 


Yes, I just started a IRA Roth with fidelity. I currently put 1000 dollars in the 2020 year on a target date fund 2050 (FIPFX).

> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


>He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said.","['GOOGL', 'TWTR', 'AAPL', 'FB']"

mvwh0z,,investing,post,1619062572,"Reconciling the Intelligent Investor with Current Bond yields.Ok, I’ve just finished The Intelligent Investor for the first time. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with investing as Graham defines it (as opposed to speculating) and the current situation with bond yields with his advice that you should keep at least 25% allocated because of the potential for things to change in the future. 

I’ve also been a fan of Ray Dalio’s advice, and recently read his post on avoiding bonds altogether.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio)

These two thought streams are seemingly at odds, and the best I can come up with is that Graham’s advice didn’t take into account such low bond yields ever existing, and I’m probably better off following Dalio’s advice:

“ I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.”

I’ve gotten rid of bond ETFs completely from my portfolio, and now have some gold, emerging Asia markets, commodities, foreign value ETFs to replace them.

I’d love to hear all of your thoughts on both reconciling Graham’s investment approach with current bond yields and on Dalio’s thoughts. What do you think?",

Dalio doesn’t need to do this because the “short cash” he mentions is code for use leverage aka just borrow to buy more stocks when needed.,
mvwh0z,gvf62wg,investing,comment,1619077366,"Graham says keep at least 25% in bonds, Dalio says avoid bonds altogether.... yes it is a fair conclusion that these thought streams are at odds.  Although not entirely. They both have their own idea of what is a stable ""safe haven"" to keep some investment in a position that is quickly and easily made liquid. That's where you have to make your own decision... What do you think is a safe haven place to park your cash where on a rainy day you can liquidate... That could be bonds, gold, apple.

Reality is all of them, and none of them.",['AAPL']
mvwh0z,gveuvqj,investing,comment,1619067991,"Be very careful reading into what’s going.  In general people epic fail at complex systems.  No one predicted the large number of retail investors joining the market due to Covid nor gamblers switching to the stock market.  Most of what is getting publish is cherry picking data to prove their point.  Very few go out of the way to try to get a basic understanding and will recognize that all the data isn’t available publicly.  It is also a very complex system so trying to make short term predictions is hard because there are simply to many variables.  So you can say what is happening right now will not last forever due to simple mathematical properties but when will the market catch up to reality who knows.  When it goes it will not be for one reason, there will be multiple complex interactions just like 2008.

If bonds are a bad investment because interest rates are too low then why are the largest players buying them?  Means the have other uses besides getting the return.  What happens if bond yields go up any significant amount?  Well the world is in a debt bubble so when companies try to refinance they won’t be able too.  So they default and assets are sold to cover their debt.  Then you have to go a step further and ask what does that mean?  When this occurs money is destroyed and liquidity in the system is smaller since the thing lending the money didn’t get made whole.

Then you have another fact when interest rates go down the bond is worth more.  So even though most bonds are paying very little interest the note itself has been appreciating in value.  Since bonds can’t really go down much more they will stop appreciating in value.  For the last 40 years people have been told to move to bonds in retirement.  Most projections for pension funds and 401k is to earn 6 to 7%.  With an aging population there simply won’t be enough people to sustain even that.  Would need to grow the economy through actual production not asset speculation.

There isn’t going to be inflation in consumer goods long term because you have to have an increase in wages with relatively the same production.  The other thing you can get inflation is through supply shocks which are usually temporary.  The goods going up in price now are due to speculation(lumber) and supply shocks.  Most of the money being created goes to asset purchases which inflates asset price.  So far all debt driven bubbles for asset purchases have popped.  The more debt you put into the system the bigger the pop.  No one knows when it will pop but no assets will be safe when it does because people will have to sell high quality assets to cover for loses in low quality.  This is why buffet has a large cash pile because he can go in and buy the high quality assets at a discount.",
mve8vh,,investing,post,1619006842,"Netflix Misses Q1 Subscriber Targets, Blaming Covid-19 Issues, But Beats Financial ForecastsNetflix reported 208 million global subscribers as of the end of the first quarter, missing its own prediction for 210 million.


The streaming giant did beat financial targets, though with earnings per share of $3.75 coming in well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.


The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

Jaguar Land Rover is to temporarily shut down production at two of its main UK factories because of a shortage of computer chips, in the latest sign of the difficulties facing the global car industry during the pandemic.

It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date.

The automotive industry is used to running lean “just-in-time” supply chains that minimise the amount of cash tied up in factory warehouses. However, the global nature of the chip shortage has strained carmakers as they compete directly with tech companies for supply.

Manufacturing will continue at JLR’s Solihull plant. JLR’s international factories in Slovakia, Brazil and China are as yet unaffected.",

End results: green energy became overvalued while oil/gas was undervalued. Anyone who invested in oil/gas 6 months ago is up big now on their investments. I think there is more room to run up on these stocks as the economy reopens.

mvoso0,,investing,post,1619037311,"$KARO - Comprehensive DD - Recent IPO - Exec Summary**Exec Summary for those that want a TL:DR**

Firstly - I am an existing shareholder, own around 900 shares with an average buy price of $34 (so I am down on this... but in the current market, who isn't). KARO are a leading global provider of vehicle telematics. The proprietary in-house technology provides the best intelligent, actionable data to fleet operators and security for all vehicle owners - across 23 countries over 5 continents. Most interesting areas of the business to me are their AI Video & Fleet Telematics, along with how they use their data to sell used cars and insurance in the future. I am impressed that they seem to keep developing the business, whilst maintaining a very healthy 15% margin.

* KARO is a holding company, the actual company is Cartrack
* 1.3m subscribers with 50 billion data points each month - data provides KARO with a huge opportunity for growth
* Business has continued strong growth through Covid (16% compared to 22% CAGR previously), expected rate is 26% for future years
* Free cash flow around 25%
* Prior to delisting from JSE, to list on NASDAQ and then do an inwards investment back onto the JSE - the stock price hit $629, with a share consolidation taking place at 10:1 - giving at all time high of $62.90 per share. Typically South African investment is more conservative that US/EU investors - who are more accepting of potential earnings forming part of the share price.
* Price to earnings is 28x - which is low in their industry, with the average being around 53x

**Products & Services**

What does KARO currently offer?

B2B - known as 'My Fleet' - Live Vision to make sure the driver is concentrating and not on their phone, insurance telematics, fleet management and optimisation, stolen vehicle recovery and fleet administration services. All services typically outsourced, not many companies I know of will invest in developing this tech themselves which is good for Karo.

B2C - known as 'My Car' - Vehicle protector, stolen vehicle recover (with promise to customer), crash alert to emergency services and insurance telematics.

**Customer Profile**

**South Africa -** De Beers, MAN, Avis, SA Taxi, Super Sport, Hino and many more - company originates from SA and very strong YOY performance here.

**Rest of Africa** \- Toyota, Cat, Moove and NCBA

**Europe** \- LaFarge, Telefurgo, Green Galaxy and Sonae MC

**Asia** \- Singapore Prison Service, ORIX, Grab Rentals & Asia Brewery

Lots more to list - company has accounts open in the UK and US - with very small amounts of trade at the moment, but they have a track record of aggressive expansion whilst maintaining margins.

**Financials (Converted from ZAR to USD... took a while, so apologies if you spot any errors)**

Without doubt my favourite part of this company, extremely strong performer and growth looks very positive, with sufficient results to back up projections.

Low Debt - $1.2m

Total Cash - $7m

Free Cash Flow Margin - 25%

Total Assets - $140m

Total Liabilities - $56m

Debt Coverage - Well covered by operating cash flow (2019%)

Gross Margin - 71%

Revenue - $167m (c.4.5x market cap)

Earnings - $27.7m (roughly 15% margin & 28x market cap - industry average listed on Nasdaq is c.50x)

I will post a link to their IPO pack in the comments section - I have looked at the financials over and over, **I really struggle to see any negatives but if you find any, please can you leave a comment as I want to keep educating myself.**

**Bull Case - Top 4 Points**

Aggressive, rapid and consistent CAGR - in the 20% range. I absolutely love this, I know I'm down right now but my price target to exit this stock is around $45 as a low estimate. Even with the market performing badly, I am not worried about my investment here. It isn't speculative, they are delivering.

Big data - its been big for a long time, I'm convinced it will continue to be big in the future. They already generate 50 billion data points a month from their existing contracts. They are looking to get further integrated with the insurance market and second hand car sales. Knowing how people drive through their current offerings is going to be huge in selling products that instantly fit with the consumers goals. If they drive fast... maybe upsell the car and have an insurance package wrapped up to help seal the deal. If they are more conservative drivers but have a powerful car, sell something more appropriate. I think this is a major opportunity for the business.

The world is going to see more crime, insurance premiums are rising, people want more protection and Karo offer a service that fills this space. Yes, there is telematics competition but in the nicest possible way car theft in the regions they currently operate in is pretty high and in regions that they don't yet operate in. Factor this alongside how much crime will increase in a post covid world (due to poverty increasing), I think that their CAGR of 26% will be achieved. Rich get richer... poor get poorer etc, its sad but generally true. Those with money will want to protect their valued assets without risking their own personal wellbeing.

Businesses need what Karo are selling. Whether its AI controlled systems or human, fleet management want 99% plus optimisation, with Karo's growth and products on offer, they simply must be offering a high quality product. Live vision & fleet tracking is something I can see growing more and more. I know from personal experience of having to deal with a particularly painful Brexit, this would have been a life saver had all the fleet been managed in this way and could be traced at a click of a button. Integrated supply chains rely on this real time data, which to my disbelief doesn't currently exist throughout the world. Note - biggest single customer represents less than 2% revenue, so they are heavily diversified.

**Bear Case - Top 4 Points**

No major contracts in USA, Germany, France or UK. I don't know why, maybe it isn't in their strategy right now, but I'd really like to see them get a big contract in one of these regions. I'm sure it will come but it isn't there right now and although they may well do well in China - the markets I mention are strong and relatively stable compared to South Africa and current countries that they operate in.

Volume - its pretty low, the good news is... its a buyers market - the spreads aren't great, so would only enter with a limit order if you did decide to invest, be patient and I'd say no real need to click the ask button right now.

Competition - there is clear competition in the telematics industry, I'm not even going to try and counter this as its a basic fact. I have based my investment on the numbers I see in their investor pack, only you can decide whether these numbers are suitable for your investment and offer competitive value against other investment opportunities.

The number of risks listed in their SEC prospectus filing was pretty crazy - my positive spin on this is that they are aware of their risks, honest about them and have strategies to counter/mitigate against them. I'll post the link so you can check this out too, but please do before making a decision on whether to invest.

**Share Structure**

Relatively simple section - NASDAQ is the priority listing, total of c.21,000,000 shares - 20,000,000 held by insiders with a 180 day lock up. 9,000,000 listed on the JSE as in inwards listing.

Cartrack (KARO) used to be listed solely on the JSE - but due to expansion plans, has now listed on Nasdaq... it was listed the same day as UTME and genuinely believe a lot of investors missed this IPO due to the hype and price increase on UTME.

The company was previously valued at over $1 billion on the JSE and the CEO didn't sell any shares, as he went on record to say that he felt the company was worth at least $1.5 billion.

**Key Catalysts**

Covid risk lowering, more people returning to normal - cars left unattended in public places, more travel, more collisions, insurance going up and people using telematics to help reduce the total cost of car ownership.

mutq93,,investing,post,1618934752,"Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's handNew York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

mw7vx7,,investing,post,1619106938,"General Partner at Initialized Capital Alda Leu Dennis speaks on investing advice from Garry Tan, why VC funding is gender-biased, and why funding for women-led startups fell during the pandemic.While male founders have consistently gotten more VC funding, the pandemic wasn’t kind to women-led startups, who received even less money from VCs in 2020. Alda Leu Dennis, a general partner at Initialized Capital, says it’s in part because of the lack of women VCs. 

In 2020, VC funding for all-female founding teams fell to 2.4%, a drop from the all-time high of 3.4% the year before, according to Crunchbase. Dennis, meanwhile, is investing in startups that could narrow the gender gap, many of which are FamTech (family tech) companies, designed to improve family life — something many of us have gotten plenty of during lockdown.

Before Initialized, Dennis was a managing partner at 137 Ventures, investing in startups like Wish, Coupang, and CourseHero. She broke into venture capital by way of law (with a stint as a CEO), serving as general counsel at Founders Fund, and assistant general counsel at Clarium Capital Management, working with Peter Thiel.

Bidding war begins as Canadian National jumps in with $34B offer for Kansas City Southern ($KSU)After last month's big news of [Canadian Pacific's ~$25B acquisition of Kansas City Southern](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma15h0/major_railroad_merger_canadian_pacific_is_buying/), a spanner has been thrown into the works as competitor Canadian National has come in with a better bid. Canadian National came out with the [details of the offer today](https://www.cn.ca/en/news/2021/04/cn-makes-superior-proposal-to-combine-with-kansas-city-southern/), which include $200 cash and 1.059 $CNI shares for each $KSU share, valuing $KSU at just about $325 as of market open. (This compares to CP's previous offer of $90 and .489 CP shares or about $275 for each $KSU share at time of offer.)

This new bid sets up a big potential struggle for the last major railroad outside the big 6. KCS would have to pay a $700M breakup fee to CP in order to accept another deal, but the offer from CN is significantly better. Both deals would still be subject to STB approval, which is uncertain, and CN may have an even harder time getting approval given some overlap with the existing KCS network.

Canadian Pacific has already [fired back in a statement](https://www.railwayage.com/freight/cn-counters-cpkc-with-a-superior-proposal/?RAchannel=regulatory):

> “CN’s proposal is massively complex and likely to fail,” CP said, guns blazing in a press release issued late on April 20. “[It] would create the third-largest Class I railroad [after UP and BNSF] and destabilize the competitive balance in the North American rail industry. The only combination involving KCS that is clearly in the public interest is the one that Canadian Pacific has proposed, which has already garnered support from more than 400 shippers and other stakeholders. While remaining the smallest of the six U.S. Class I railroads by revenue, a combination [of] CP and KCS creates stronger single-line competition against existing Class I routes.

KCS shareholders are likely feeling like the belle of the ball with multiple bidders now in the mix and the lurking potential of a bid from Union Pacific or even Berkshire Hathaway (BNSF). At minimum CP would likely have to improve their offer in order to see it accepted. $KSU was up 15% to $295.50 at the end of today's trading.","['BLL', 'BRK.B', 'KSU', 'UNP']"

muxxha,,investing,post,1618945936,"I think Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and ArchegosTo understand what’s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill’s insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I’m guessing it’s directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don’t have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I’ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse’s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don’t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won’t be pretty either way.

Now let’s talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don’t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos’s TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn’t justify the hit Credit Suisse’s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash – they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn’t have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn’t enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I’m confident I’m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. There are too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to act as a catalyst for more bad news, and the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market’s behavior over the past several days, I think it’s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I’m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss’s interaction with Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS’s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I’m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.

Edit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I won't tell you what to think, but I do want to give my personal thoughts. I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of ""adjusted"" and ""excluding significant items"" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a ton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term. This is a play that I believe will likely take several years to pay off.","['DISCA', 'MS', 'GS', 'VIAC']"

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",

mu1z70,gv3e37x,investing,comment,1618847585,"Nice fundamentals.   I think COIN is probably the most compelling IPO of 2021 and the stock price could double more easily than a lot of other tickers out there.     

One question is how the stock will contend with the approval of a BTC ETF, if this occurs.   Right now, many COIN buyers want exposure to the crypto sector, but with the investor protections of a publicly traded equity.  A natural place for it is in a Roth IRA.   But, if a BTC ETF is approved (and that's a big if) wouldn't you rather have that instead?

An attractive feature of COIN's ""we sell shovels in this gold rush"" investment thesis is that buying it means you don't have to pick a winner in the crypto boom.  If BTC ends up #1, you make money, but you also make money if it's ETH, or if it's one of the touted Ethereum killers (if a coin they don't have like Solana really takes off, they will add it).

mu39cq,,investing,post,1618846536,"SPAR Group (SGRP), Smal Cap stock, Full DDHello guys, i am searching for undervalued small cap stocks to invest in for myself and think that  can share this researches with you. Maybe someone will find it usefull and i will find some new information here.  Also English its not my native language, sorry in advance for some mistakes. 

  
SPAR Group is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more. Its from their 10K.  


I screen stocks for their fundamentals and then, if i see something interesting there, iam going deeper.

**Lets see their multiples first:**

\- P/E 10,4x

\- P/B 1,1x

\- ROIC 26%

\- Net debt (- 2,7 mln $) ( they have more cash in their balance than debt).

\- Total debt/ CFO( cash flow from operations) = 1,5x. 

They have really good fundamentals and strong balance sheet. Also positive FCFF ( free cash flow to the firm).  

Their revenue  for 2020 was 230,5 mln $( 252,8 mln $ in 2019, - 9% YOY Growth). It consist of two majore sources. Revenue in United states was 92,1 mln $, International revenue 138,4 mln $.

  


| Net international revenue: | **2020** | YOY Growth |2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brazil| **49,940**|\-24%| 65,942|
|South Africa | **28,235** |4%| 27,201 |
|Mexico | **22,679**|\-3%| 23,324|
|China | **12,401** |\-5%| 12,993 |
|Japan | **9,273**|\-19%| 11,469 |
|India | **8,589**  |\-3%| 8,813   |
|Canada | **6,294** |\-31%| 9,059  |
|Australia | **988**  |\-68%| 3,087|
|Turkey|**-**|\-100%| 268  |
|Total international revenue|**138,399 (59,9% of revenue)**|\-15%| 162,156  (64,1% of revenue)|

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what.",

mtjvlt,,investing,post,1618774981,"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

mt2tfk,,investing,post,1618706696,"Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense InvestingI wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often.",['SPGI']

I specifically invest in those because they give exposure to the world, instead of ETFs with a focus on the US, like VTI and VOO.

Or so I thought...

[VT has a market allocation of 57.1% to US and only 4.5% to China.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vt)

[To adjust for this you can buy an ETF with a focus on China, e.g. VWO.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo)

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this). If you then want to take the additional step of being overweight China equities broadly, something like VWO doesn't sound crazy.  And that step is an interesting debatable topic.",
msaeih,,investing,post,1618600826,"Next week, the US cannabis industry is nearing its first major federal legislation milestone of the year. SAFE Act[**Marijuana Banking Bill Expected To Get A House Floor Vote Next Week, Sponsor’s Office Says**](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-banking-bill-expected-to-get-a-house-floor-vote-next-week-sponsors-office-says/)

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",['ED']

msaeih,gusgny2,investing,comment,1618620995,"I'm heavy in US Cannabis and my heaviest position is in Cresco. Just want to drop a little fundamental analysis here for you guys and expand on SAFE further. 

Bullish Arguments First: 

Currently, the Big 4 MSO's that you mentioned above are trading at a P/S ratio of near or about 7. Meaning their market caps are about 7x their 2020 Revenues. Cresco, specifically, is 6.88 P/S. To compare, CGC and APHA have a P/S of 26 and 9, respectively. MNST is a Consumer Packaged Good [CPG] that trades at about 11 P/S, although that's not a perfect comparison. I consider Cannabis a mix between Agriculture and CPG, so I chose MNST for a comparison with a more mature growth company. Now, a P/S near 7 isn't that crazy of a discount, since that's what more mature growth companies are trading near. However, that's not considering the exponential growth that each state brings in terms of sales. Each state has a TAM boost of maybe near 1-2 Billion. Each MSO had Year over Year growths of over 100% in sales. And the estimates for 2021 and 2022 remain over 100%. For example, Cresco has a 2022 estimated P/S of **2.5**. Meaning the stock price should 3-4 x to catch up to the 2022 P/S expectation. The estimates are fairly conservative, because they don't consider that the MSO's could potentially reach scale in NJ, NY, and other states that just legalized recreational cannabis. They also aren't fully considering the acquisitions being made and how they could boost revenues and the increased demand in states like Illinois (Did you see those sales numbers?! March had the highest sales OF ALL TIME). 

Talking about acquisitions, it helps lead me into my next point. The MSO's have been incredibly successful, but they've essentially had one arm tied behind their backs. They are forced to trade in Canadian markets and over the counter so their equity raises for acquisitions are heavily handicapped. They are also taxed heavy because Cannabis is linked to Section 280E. Not to mention, they don't even have access to banking yet, which is what SAFE will help with. Literally, they have cash block rooms for the IRS to collect taxes. There are a fair amount of headwinds they are running into, but they are still growing an incredible amount; not to mention that all the Big 4 are already generating positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of the Section 280 and federal handicaps they run up against.  None of the big Canadian players are generating positive EBITDA yet, for comparison, and they don't have to worry about the same federal headwinds. The problem, in my opinion, with the Canadians is Canada is one country, with population roughly equal to CA or TX, but with the entire US's worth of competition; there's also no limit on supply of Cannabis. Basic supply and demand, but more supply, less pricing power and lower the margins. The US limits licenses for legalized states so supply is topped. Illinois has the best blueprint, in my opinion, and they are being called the Silicon Valley of Weed. Just SAFE passing and getting off of [280E](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-irs-tries-to-collect-taxes-from-marijuana-companies-through-280e/) will create a massive earnings gap fill (earnings will legit near double). 

[Now what does SAFE do for us?](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/would-safe-banking-allow-msos-to-uplist-onto-major-u-s-exchanges-the-experts-weigh-in/) We already know it will pass House next week. We just need the 10 votes in Senate. There are a lot of different viewpoints on SAFE, but the most bullish is if it can help sway the US exchanges to allow for uplisting. Uplisting is the #1 catalyst we should look out for. This opens the door for institutions, ETF's, other fundies, even robinhooders to buy the stock. Right now I think most of them are buying the Canadians instead, which don't have real growth prospects in the US. They can't enter the US THC market and remain listed because it's illegal federally. So while they are doing their thing in Canada, the US MSO's are growing and scaling in key states. When it's federally legal, Canadians might try to enter, but they won't have the time or the equity to scale and compete. It sucks because they had to learn all the lessons the hard way, and now, the US names learned from their mistakes AND they get to keep the Canadians out while they grow and reach scale. It's actually quite fortunate for them the way it worked out. If Cannabis was legalized federally too quickly, the Canadians could have just used their sheer market cap to bully and acquire the US MSO's. 

I can go on all night, but I've spent a fair amount of time writing this up already. Let's briefly discuss the bearish viewpoints.

1) Congress. They could hold up legislation for Cannabis. Although SAFE is one that we should expect in 2021, decriminalization and federal legalization will take time. SAFE doesn't guarantee uplisting, but helps the % chance it can happen in 2021. Today there was news of a federal Bill that allows Veterans to carry legal medical Cannabis across illegal state lines. That's a pretty good start, if it can pass. 

2) Margin compressions. As the market for US Cannabis matures, companies will experience margin compression. Especially as more licenses are distributed. This probably doesn't happen for many years or until growth stales. 

3) ??? I'm sure there are more.

msnd53,guva6w4,investing,comment,1618676032,"I was just having lazy afternoon today thinking about random stuff. I was thinking how in 2018 everyone was pessimistic about markets because equities were very expensive (by 2018 standards) and companies were loaded with debt. Also growth was slowing down and major companies were reporting lower earnings. Hard to believe but people were worried about Apple as it was selling less iPhones year over year. I remember we had quite a big crash in 2018 but then China saved us. Literally China saved out butts and prevented recession. Then things went as they did afterwards people were again complaining about how equities were very expensive and growth was slowing. There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that. This is very interesting and I'm so interested to see where this will end up.",['AAPL']

&#x200B;

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

AST Spacemobile the real deal with over 1000 patents, extensive satellite expertise particularly their CEO, and their own majority owned satellite subsidiarity Nanoavionics and is already cash flow positive. AST Spacemobile itself has no debt.

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

&#x200B;

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['TWTR', 'AMT', 'MS', 'DISH', 'AAPL']"

myztnx,,StockMarket,post,1619449740,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.

https://preview.redd.it/n790ugjr9jv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=07845e5d4b41a4877dd6cd180ae1faa450adfc46

For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation 

b. One month after recommendation 

c. One quarter after recommendation 

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/k2lc2u1t9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbb6b197286b47782ede7f068f6648eacf492ae

Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

https://preview.redd.it/y39cv6iu9jv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e24eec21c5018c01febdcdc234136935a0a01b6

 Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)

**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** 

https://preview.redd.it/5cx0ov1x9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=50549713d2ae8696b3012add7dbc2fe68ddad8a0

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains. 

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?** 

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:** 

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired. 

**Conclusion:** 

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

All of this isn’t financial advice. I strongly recommend reading the whole post but if you're lazy there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

*About the company*

The goal of this company (and sector) is to revolutionize mental healthcare. How do they want to do this? MindMed focuses on different psychedelic drugs including Psilocybin, LSD, DMT and the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC (18-MC has huge potential in opioid withdrawal therapy and doesn’t have the side effects of Ibogaine). These drugs are currently being tested in numerous trials to ensure that the treatment methods are effective and safe, but everyone that has ever taken any kind of psychedelics knows about the immense potential which these kind of drugs have. The drugs address all kinds of mental health problems including Depression, PTSD, Anxiety and Addiction. And not one of these mental health problems is becoming less common, Corona and shit makes our mental health even worse by the day.

Are there effective drugs already on the market to treat these diseases? Not really, instead opioid addictions are growing faster than ever and there is no real solution - apart from psychedelics. To make the treatment as individual as possible MNMD has a project called ""Albert"" where they work with AI/machine learning, this is really a big factor because they are already getting all the data they need from the trials. The CEO himself has said that this is a company equally specialized in technology and in pharma. He called MindMed the „Tesla of Mental Health“, I think this describes MindMed best. The company also has a crazy good [team](https://mindmed.co/team/), they got ex Google and Pfizer employees.

*Previous Research*

Psychedelics in the mental health sector are not a completely new idea, this topic has been researched a lot in the 1950’s and 1960’s. There are a lot of studies from that time indicating the [positive effects](https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/sep/02/psychedelic-psychiatry) of these drugs in patients with different mental health disorders. But because of the Criminalisation of psychedelics in the western world beginning in the 1960’s, this topic was not picked up by researchers until the 1990’s. Since then multiple studies have been made and are currently happening.

Recent studies have shown that low doses of psilocybin are as effective as the industry standard SSRIs!

[Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146667/)

[Trial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994)

[Effects of psychedelics on the brain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718307551)

[Effects of MDMA-assisted therapy](https://maps.org/research/mdma/ptsd/phase3)

*Financials*

Okay the drugs are great blabla, what about the financials tho? How can they afford these incredibly expensive trials? The answer: they got a ton of cash from previous offerings, the latest number i could find was [$161](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-announces-2020-year-end-financial-results-current-cash-balance-of-161-million-usd-203-million-cad-to-support-drug-development-pipeline-and-creation-of-psychedelic-medicine-tech-platform-301258180.html) Mio USD. This will finance the company in the coming years. Will they have to raise more money eventually? Maybe, but right now they are good. As soon as the first drugs get approved, this company will make *a lot* of money, not because they are exploitative but because the market for mental health disorders is huge (it’s about [$20 billion](https://mindmed.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MindMed-Corporate-Presentation-4.12.2021.pdf) right now and this number is growing rapidly).

*Competition*

Okay all looking beautiful, but what about the competition? What if MNMD just isn't the company that is developing the best product for the market? Let me put it this way; Mind Medicine is the undisputed leader in this emerging sector right now. The second biggest player (looking at MarketCap, trials and cash available) is Compass Pathways. There are many reasons why I personally would not invest in this company; first of all they have much fewer trials going on. If I'm already investing in a very risky company, I want to choose the one that is most likely going to succeed. And in the pharma industry you can lower that risk by investing in a company which is developing many different drugs/treatments (MindMed has over 10 trials going on, CMPS has only one), this way if one trial fails the company won't go bankrupt. Even if they only get one drug approved they will be doing great, we're still talking about a growing market worth Billions. Another thing is Compass´attempt at [patenting](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7amw4/is-it-possible-to-create-an-ethical-psychedelics-company) shit like the color of the walls and other ridiculous stuff, I personally can't invest in them because of my moral standards.

*Celebrities*

Everyone investing in stocks knows that Musk's tweets are more important than fundamentals, that's why I have to mention this. Cathie Wood has heard about this, she didn’t directly say she would invest in this company but she knows about the disruptive potential of this company, and is there a more fitting stock for the ARK Innovation ETF out there? [Kevin O‘Leary](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinolearytv/status/1385631204758728706) aka Mr. Wonderful has been supporting this company since early last year, even if you do not like him you have to admit that he has quite a lot of publicity. The company is also doing a lot of PR, with the CEO JR Rahn giving numerous interviews within the last months.

*NASDAQ*

$MNMD is the ticker.

Aside from the news, I am extremely long term on this stock as it has amazing potential for future gains. They are currently working on “project Lucy” which consists of micro dosing the psychoactive ingredient in LSD, Ibogaine.

You can find numerous posts/discussions about how effective this stuff really is, even myself can admit to Ibogaine playing a huge role in getting my life back and I’m sure many reading can agree.

Besides from my opinion, project Lucy has been making headlines on its effective s towards combating mental health when used along with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), or any therapy for that matter. 

There’s still lots of time to get in before this takes off in the near future. With catalysts such as Kevin O’Leary taking big stakes in the stock and the chances of one of their products becoming FDA approved in the future make MNMD the front runner in psychedelic stocks.

My personal price target once clinical trials begin rolling out is around $20-$50 easily, especially when FDA approved.

I am not a financial advisor and should not be thought of as one, this is only my opinion and personal DD :)

* **No IND required**
* **Fast-tracked approvals**
* **Generous R&D refunds**
* **Excellent health system Access to patient databases**
* **Data accepted by FDA, EMA, CFDA & PDMA**

Only one molecule being trialed by MNMD is related to psilocybin, and while it will be a game changer in treating depression (a multi billion dollar addressable market) it’s nothing compared to 18-MC. The 18-MC molecule is derived from Ibogaine, which has been used for decades to successfully treat opioid addiction/dependence. We’re dealing with an opioid addiction crisis in this country, and if this molecule is properly applied you can cure, and not string along addiction. 

Second, and also important. This isn’t a recreational drug company. They aren’t giving you shrooms so you can stare at black light posters and melt your face. They’ve taken the active molecules from psychedelics so they can treat disorders of massive scale (PTSD, depression, ADHD, opioid addiction) in a clinical setting. This is NOTHING.

I have seen some fairly famous gurus, some saying Fibonacci is the key to trading and some saying it doesn’t even work at all. When I discovered what *does* really work, then at least I now understand the role of Fibonacci and what it really shows you for identifying the probability of entries and exits.. You can see this for yourself and prove that it's true about all financial markets in general.

Many traders can get overly fascinated with Fibonacci to the point that they start believing that it is a trading strategy or would be the reason for *whether* there is an entry for a trade while not really being aware of the real reason.

Yet many times it is spot on and looks like a perfectly precision clockwork machine. So how do you know?

Yes, Fibonacci has some relevance, not to support and resistance zones, per se, but for identifying ends of corrections to trends. Or for projecting wave targets. It can have some amazing accuracy but can also be a total distraction from understanding the *real* reasons for entering trades.

Ok so how do you use Fibonacci?   And why do so many traders look at a chart and say such ridiculous things like, I’m going long at 61.8 or some other completely meaningless irrelevant nonsense?

Doesn’t it make sense that in order to use Fibonacci you would need to read chart patterns first using basic understanding of what trends are and what corrections are with some reference to Elliott Wave before it is useful to measure anything?   Otherwise you will see people measuring things that have no relevance and should not be measured. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zy9s9cjlznv61.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe8896e91d4f3150fafa958f639f04984e16b20

 So if there is a value to Fibonacci it would be from measuring certain types of patterns relative to certain other types.  Measuring a movement down relative to a movement up could be a mistake.   If for instance there was an end of a correction and someone started measuring the next movement relative to that it would be useless because a trader who knows this would know the price would go past 100% and keep on going. 

The next step would be to notice that when there is an end of correction for one currency pair or other equity, there will be a similar end of correction on several others at the exact same time. 

Here you can see that on the EUR AUD the end of this correction seems to have turned right at 78%.   Amazing!  But why not 61.8% or 50% or 38%?  Should we sell at each of those levels and see what happens?  Is there a way to know which level it will turn at?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dvu38bxpznv61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=c28aa3b0afc350fafba6817a5c6c4a78e3e346dd

 But with the almost exactly inversely correlated AUD CHF pair this one made the exact same turn but at a level that is as far from a Fibonacci level as is possible.  Therefore is Fibonacci the reason for the entry?  

On gold, XAU USD the near perfect turn formed at a level that is as far from a fibonacci level as is possible.  How is it then that we identified that turn right on the dot and got in right at the very point?   How can you know how to enter a trade if it is not because of the Fibonacci level?  The obvious answer is because of identifying the end of a correction which is not done by fibonacci.  Fib levels can give 5-10 Points on the probability rating scale but the pattern itself has a much higher rating on that scale. So these turns can easily be identified and many times I check the fibonacci level AFTER entering the trade not IN ORDER to enter the trade. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syrfuzstznv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=677a06d93d5967c781f8c5d1d3df461c7f0a718c

 Yet, on XAU GBP there is a 38% level hit right on the mark for an entire 5 wave pattern and 78% hit for the last wave by itself.  Amazing! But is that the reason it’s an entry? 

When you see what really shows whether or not there is an entry and the reason it is an entry or not, then the whole question of whether or not Fibonacci works will sound like whether or not a measuring tape works in building houses. Yes a measuring tape works to assist with building a house but if you go to a construction site and start measuring things thinking you are building a house you could be missing something else.

I went to numerous seminars on using Fibonacci in trading and took enough courses to fill a closet. And now if a trade forms I see it and the turn might happen at a Fibonacci level or it might be as far away from a level as possible.I was recently at a popular Forex trading seminar in my area where a famous guru gives a big presentation that leads to the conclusion that the participant should buy his product. So one of the reasons given is that he tried using Fibonacci and harmonic patterns and his teacher told him to enter at a certain level and the market did not turn. Then he was told to enter at the next level and it did not turn there either. So another level was guaranteed to be the turn and as you might guess he lost so much money it was devastating.

The phenomenon described is one that I am familiar with and I know exactly why it happens. The reason requires learning a new way of trading altogether but to sum it up, if there was an end of a trend on a longer time frame such as the daily and then the trader goes to a shorter time frame like the 1 hour without realizing the market turned, it can look  exactly like a correction but it will keep stretching and never stop. This phenomenon has caused people I know and respect to lose so much capital that their accounts are nearly wiped out.

The reason is because Fibonacci seems to be mathematical and gives trading a sense of being a technical activity.

Traders feel like they have these lines on their charts and are measuring things and that makes it look like they engaged in some kind of engineering work. And yet the reason for entry has very little to do with those lines or measuring anything.

When an entry forms what is the real reason for it being an entry? Is it because the price went to a Fibonacci level? Why that level? Why not another level? The whole retracement level is covered with levels and when the market turns it is often at a level that is in the exact center of the levels or at a place that is totally random and not related to Fibonacci. 

This brings me back to the way to use Fibonacci. So many traders I have known have been trained by some guru like Joe DeNapoli or maybe through a Youtube channel. One seminar I attended called it the Jedi Forex Method and showed some Fibonacci strategies used by another famous trading mentor. And the truth is it can be fascinating and seem powerful.

Notice in the chart above how the market forms a correction in a downtrend on the US Dollar index and hit the 61.8 % retracement level turning like a natural precision clockwork machine. But what about all the other times when it doesn’t turn at that level of it doesn’t turn at any level? Why do traders put some much emphasis on something that is totally hit and miss and actually has little to do with whether there is a winning trade? It’s the same reason for most of the mistakes made in trading. Trading technical knowledge is fascinating and traders make the mistake of believing that this means it has a meaning in trading becoming the reason for entering. So many of these “fascinating” phenomena are almost irrelevant to the actual reason for entering.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/07tivjs10ov61.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aac9cc2545adec8b10947c30ac5e58ba2ff8360

 Here is one way to prove that. Look at a group of correlated pairs. Such as for the U.S. dollar you can look at the Dow Jones U.S. Dollar Index, the DXY U.S. Dollar Index, the EUR USD, and the USD CHF. Or you could take some of my favorites, the AUD CHF, EUR AUD, NZD CHF and EUR NZD. The next time there is an end of correction measure all of them. Notice that one of two might be at Fibonacci levels and the others are not. So are the levels the reason for seeing the entry? If so, you can’t see or know there is an entry on the rest of them?

In this chart, you can see first that there is a perfectly shaped and proportioned trend that is highlighted. This happens to be from today with the Dow Jones U.S. Dollar index which has no weighting like the DXY.

&#x200B;

 So the reason I identified this entry right smack on the dot and do that on a regular basis is not because of the Fibonacci. It’s because of being able to easily read and recognize 2 distinct shapes which serve as “letters” of the “alphabet” in the “language” of financial markets. It’s unfortunate that few people can read this, and yet it’s very obvious with no special skill needed.

If children can learn to read letters like “A”, “B”, and “C” in the first grade and then learn the meanings these shapes have using the to spell words that form sentences, then adult traders naturally have the skill to learn to read financial markets IF they are not conditioned by useless training and strategies, to NOT see these and put focus on things that are not related to that.

For me, I can see it every day and other people can see it. Many people know that it is true that markets form these and by observation can know the high probability that they continue to repeat over and over.

If you have a group of correlated pairs and at some point they all turn, forming the end of corrections often similarly on each one. Some are at Fibonacci levels and some are not. Yet, the reason to enter can be obvious on all of them, leading anyone to know that the reason is not because of Fibonacci or a certain expected level. One you know what the reason is you can keep using Fibonacci without believing it is the reason for entering.

This is just the beginning of the story and if you want to learn more join in our live trading sessions and see these entries forming every day in real time. You will enjoy entering trades for the real reason they are identified and have a good time with friends and associates.","['GOOGL', 'DOW']"

mztrkn,,StockMarket,post,1619544519,"Tax Question -- Gains and Losses, Multiple TradesApologies in advance if this is the wrong place to ask this.

Let's say I start the year with a $10,000 account. I make the following trades:

* Buy Option A for $10,000.
   * Sell Option A for $20,000.
   * Realize $10,000 profit.
* Buy Option B for $20,000
   * Get rekd. Sell Option B for $5,000.
   * Realize $15,000 loss.

And end the year with $5,000 in my account.

I understand traders can deduct losses up to $3,000 each year, then carry over the rest to the next year.

How does it work in this situation? Overall for the year I'm down $5,000. But I did make $10k profit selling Option A. Would I still be on the hook for taxes on that $10k profit, minus $3k losses for the loss on Option B?

Keep an eye on what happens to option chain after hours and what that would do to your account if you had options. Then add it all up.

They’re making people think their account is some crazy number because options don’t trade until opening bell. Then they’re adjusting the option chain to the correct numbers for the day/stock price. So your account looks like it lost a lot of money. People selling their options like crazy and stock price drops.

First Graphene Limited got a patent on a really promising process to convert oil into graphene, graphit and clean hydrogen.

Why I am now convinced about this stock:

1. its a good opportunity for oil producers to enter the green energy market

2. patents granted and pending ensure process is exclusive to First Graphene

3. really low stock price currently at 0.18€

4. graphene is the future material that will be used in batteries in the future, especially interesting for electric cars and First Graphene is the leading producer of graphene 

5. graphene is a really cool material, one layer of atoms is that strong it can hold a football without breaking

Current 15m price action is highlighting a bullish channel that has formed and has bias to break to the upside.

The price is happily riding on the 20 blue EMA which means that the strong uptrend remains active.

RSI is giving slight bearish divergence as it's creating new lower highs while price makes new highs. Yet the overall RSI trend is an uptrend as the clear trend of higher lows is suggesting. Another thing to mention is the fact that it refuses to go below 60, meaning bullish momentum is present on the short time frame.

MACD is about to turn into a buying wave in a corrective, pretty high, which would mean a stronger buying pressure than usual, a volume spike possibly.

Overall short term trend is a strong uptrend as the price continues to ride above 20 EMA.

mz8dsc,,StockMarket,post,1619472124,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 26, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 26, 2021**

The stock traded mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) continuing strong momentum from last week while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly fell. Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Last week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) beat analyst expectations in their earnings report. The stock is modestly down at the time of writing
   * Revenue of $10.39 billion vs $10.29 billion expected (up from $6 billion a year earlier)
   * EPS of $0.93 vs $0.79 expected

* The vaccinations effort continues with over 200 million Americans receiving at least one shot and 90 million adults fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the CDC.
* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,"" White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.
* In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles.

It seems like anyone who has anything bad to say gets downvoted and only the people saying “this thing will be huge in x timeline” get upvoted.

Does anyone else find this to be true? Why do you think this is the case?

For example, I see a stock I own doing poorly short term. So it’s interesting for time to go to that website to see what people are saying about the stock to see if I’ve missed any news. Every time this happens I end up wanting to buy more based on what all these people are saying! 

I don’t end up buying more but it really messes with my head. I’m new to the markets and don’t really know how to do my own DD so it feels like most of my stock picks are ultimately guesses. Of course I don’t just blindly dump money places, but there’s not a ton of business analysis backing my decisions.

This is dangerous because these comments sway my opinion. If I go to the comment section with a negative mindset, and I end up leaving wanting to buy more of the stock, I could only imagine what affect this has on me whenever I am looking at purchasing a new stock (one I’m not down on).

This will help. Tech stocks like ROKU, Netflix, Spotify do not have as much “physical plant” like more traditional companies and therefore need to be evaluated on expected performance. You need to read news on the company and CEO statements to evaluate their potential.

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**

**Monday, April 26th:**

mysqx4,,StockMarket,post,1619424887,"Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE) - May 11 Q1ERJP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose ""enormous competitive threats"" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them “taking over and revolutionizing banking” with “a wholesale transition” of “a $16 trillion market cap”.

In this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:

&#x200B;

Common bear arguments:

\#1 Old business

\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat

\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult

\#4 No growth

\#5 Slow growth

\#6 Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.

\#7 Not profitable

\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell

\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.

\#10 It’s a SPAC

&#x200B;

\#1) Old business. 

Paysafe’s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Much of Paysafe’s business is in back-end payment processing so most don’t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method” and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Paysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They’ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Aside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service. 

In preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun & Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.

As Chairman Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab…I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. 

&#x200B;

\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. 

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe’s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,“a fortress. It’s got a moat… We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise."" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion ""unbanked"" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors

From SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: “To be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“To be a winner in this space, you’re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That’s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we’ve entered.”

&#x200B;

\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. 

Synergistic inorganic growth through M&A is a key pillar of Paysafe’s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” (2, 4)

&#x200B;

\#4) No growth. 

It’s true that Paysafe’s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev

2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)

2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).

2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, “exited low value referral channels” and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

—Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

— Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.

&#x200B;

\#5) Slow growth. 

Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe’s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.

Analyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”

In the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:

1 ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

2 ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""

3 New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

4 ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""

5 ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

6 ”Delaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March""

7 ""Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%""

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign:

&#x200B;

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Notes:

1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.

2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.

3 As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.

4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

&#x200B;

\#6) Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more. 

Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity’s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”

Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: “Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.” Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:

Square: 77.8X

Repay : 8.7X

Fiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X

GPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X

Shift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA

Affirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA

Paysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA

Bill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA

Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe’s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they’ll be able to fund M&A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.

&#x200B;

\#7) Not profitable. 

Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, “Paysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company’s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.”

These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:

Repay: -0.67,

Affirm : -2.18,

Nuvei : -1.08,

Paysign : -0.19.

Bill : -0.62,

Shift4 : -0.43

Average EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69

If you read their transcripts and presentations, you’ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They’ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.

&#x200B;

\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. 

The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it’s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.

Importantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley’s time-tested M&A playbook.

Blackstone itself says (9), “The term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.” With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”

In a recent interview Foley said, private equity’s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the table…All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.”

The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand his both his M&A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the “The Foley Network” (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity’s massive transactional volume). In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, “The thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it’s a great asset.”

But, let's assume these funds do eventually sell a portion of their shares which, given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square’s, but more profitable), would allow index funds to accumulate larger positions. Just as large funds often drive price down to accumulate shares, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and do so via off-market trades, avoiding price slippage. This question is less about real risk than it is about short-term fear, which is ultimately why understanding the context and fundamentals is so critical.

&#x200B;

\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. 

According to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.

Importantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.

Total FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 % 

Blackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 % 

CVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 % 

Other Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 % 

Cannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 % 

PIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 % 

723,734,536 100.0 % 

Below are some examples of the warrant cashless conversion rates per the chart in the S1 (7). Cash redemption is more profitable when commons trade above $18. 

$18 : $6.50

$17 : $6.08 

$16 : $5.57

$15 : $5.05

$14 : $4.54

$13 : $4.04 

&#x200B;

\#10) It’s a SPAC. Maybe the best argument.

Paysafe has been tarred and feathered as a SPAC: guilty until proven innocent. Even after ticker change, Cramer called it a SPAC in the same breath that he said, “There is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.”

It’s a hard moniker to drop. Literally every bear article written on Paysafe has relied on arguing that it was suspect because it was a SPAC, saying things like because Chamath sold Virgin Galactic, Paysafe can't be trusted. By contrast the bull articles that bothered to explore the fundamentals generally came up with $24-25 price targets, usually by comparing to PayPal.

Despite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from the media’s indiscriminate wack-a-SPAC narrative, to forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements without prior notice, to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms. In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of “fake sell walls” and HFS “short ladder attacks” as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. 

I think Paysafe is a 3X from here. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space with notoriously “sticky” customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds are poised to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.

&#x200B;

Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe’s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:

$360 million revenue

$220 million gross profit

$105 million EBITDA

Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund, Inc. (NYSE American: CLM) (the ""Fund"") announced today, contingent upon final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that it has fixed the close of business on April 16, 2021 as the record date (the ""Record Date"") for determination of stockholders entitled to participate in the Fund's 1-for-3 rights offering. The Fund is issuing to its stockholders non-transferable rights entitling the holders to subscribe for an aggregate of 26,029,753 shares of common stock. Each stockholder will receive one non-transferable right for each share of the Fund held as of the Record Date. Fractional Shares will not be issued upon the exercise of the Rights. Accordingly, the number of Rights to be issued to a Stockholder on the Record Date will be rounded up to the nearest whole number of Rights evenly divisible by three. For every three rights a stockholder receives, he or she will be entitled (but not required) to purchase one new share of the Fund at a subscription price equal to the greater of (i) 107% of net asset value per share as calculated at the close of trading on the expiration date of the offering or (ii) 80% of the market price per share at such time. Fractional shares will not be issued. In addition to the shares offered in the primary subscription, the Fund may offer a 100% over-allotment to oversubscribing stockholders. Stockholders who fully subscribe in the primary offering will have the option to oversubscribe for additional shares, to the extent available.

The subscription period will commence shortly after the Record Date, and will expire at 5:00 p.m., EDT, on Friday, May 14, 2021, (the ""Expiration Date"") unless extended. The actual subscription price per share will be determined on the Expiration Date.

Shares will be issued within the 15-day period immediately following the record date of the Fund's May 2021 monthly distribution to stockholders. Stockholders exercising their rights to purchase shares pursuant to the offering will not be entitled to receive such distribution with respect to the shares issued pursuant to such exercise.

This press release is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy or an invitation to purchase or subscribe for any securities in any jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. The offering is subject to an effective registration statement covering the rights and shares to be issued and to other customary regulatory filings and approvals.

If you so choose, you can then exchange those rights + some cash for more (new) shares of the fund. You will need 3 rights for each new share (the 1-for-3 ratio), and the cash cost will be the greater of 107% of the fund's NAV on May 14, 2021, or 80% of the trading price at the end of the same day.

Note that unlike many rights offerings, these rights are **non**-transferable. You can't sell them to someone else; you must either exercise them or lose them when they expire (also occurring May 14).

The offering also states that there is an oversubscription privilege which (in this case) I think says that if you use all of your allotted rights, you may then be allowed to purchase even more of the new shares *if* they are available (i.e., some do not use all of their rights).

I believe this is correct, but as I said, I am not an expert. If you are still uncertain, I recommend calling your broker.

myvlah,,StockMarket,post,1619436808,"8 Reasons to invest in WELL Health Technologies8 Reasons
WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) Could Be the Healthtech Play of the Future

1
Multi-channel Capability: With healthcare clinics, EMR services, telehealth offerings, digital apps, and more, the company is truly multi-channel, and omni-channel in nature – able to offer both in-person and digital solutions to patients, healthcare professionals, and clinics. This allows the company to not only benefit from all aspects of the healthcare industry, but also provides defensive diversification qualities.

2
Track Record of Accretive Acquisitions: WELL Health (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) has a solid track record of buying profit-generating companies that can continually add value to its bottom line – all with carefully-controlled shareholder dilution. For instance, due to its acquisition of CRH Health, it is expected to experience 120% accretion to revenue and 800% accretion to EBITDA on a per share basis. However, shareholder dilution was limited to a mere 17%.

3
Value-Boosting Synergies Within Business Lines: Post-acquisition, the company also has multiple opportunities to add further value to its acquisitions via internal synergies within its business lines. For example, the company is planning to cross-sell its digital services to CRH Health’s network of over 3,000 Gastroenterologist physicians, which are currently generally digitally underserved.

4
Rapid Acquisition and Growth Strategy: Within the first three months of 2021 alone, WELL Health (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) has already announced six acquisitions – one of which is a major US player. The company also has another 10 signed letters of intent that could add C$100+ million to annual revenues. Further, recent acquisition CRH Medical is itself a proven M&A player with a track record of 32 acquisitions and over 500 active deal targets.

5
Strong Investor Base: Multi-billionaire Li Ka-shing is a strategic investor in the company, among other institutional investors such as Manulife, CI Investments, Sentry Investments, Iconiq Capital, Fiera Capital, and the PenderFund Capital. Li Ka-shing and his partner personally led a C$302.5 million equity raise for the CRH Medical acquisition with their own investment of C$100M at an unprecedented 25% premium to market (based on the 5 day VWAP before announcement) – the additional C$202.5M came from the other institutional investors at the same premium.

6
Well Funded With a Strong Balance Sheet: WELL Health (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) boasts C$87 million in cash as at end-2020 – with zero debt. Only recently did the company take on some debt as part of the CRH Medical acquisition. However, even said debt facility was obtained at highly cost-effective rates of between 1.5% to 3.25% depending on leverage ratios.

7
Future US IPO Listing: The company’s targeted US IPO in late 2021 will provide an additional cash infusion that it can use to turbocharge its acquisition strategy. Further, analysts also expect a US listing to push the company’s valuation upwards to a level more in line with its peers. WELL is grossly undervalued when compared against US comps.

8
Proven Management Team with Skin in the Game: WELL Health’s (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) management team are all veterans of Tio Networks, a multichannel bill payment processor that was acquired by PayPal for C$304 million in 2017.13 They’re also all heavily invested in the company, with the CEO personally investing approximately C$6 million in company stock – and never having sold a single share or taken a dollar of cash as salary thus far.","['CI', 'PYPL', 'EMR']"

myvlah,gvx3dyl,StockMarket,comment,1619437266,"WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) Remains Substantially Undervalued Compared to Its Peers…
Even though…

Its EBITDA already turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2020, with a 53% revenue growth for the year…

It’s just completed a major acquisition that would add approximately C$175 million in revenues and C$72 million in EBITDA to its earnings…

WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) has 10 signed letters of intent that could add another C$100+ million to its annual revenues by the end of 2021…

And it’s planning a US IPO by the end of the year.



When compared to others in the industry, WELL’s peer group trades at 10x to 20x revenue multiples, while WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) trades at an EV to sales multiple of just 5x.

This means that although the company is far from being a risky early-stage startup company…

It still has plenty of room to grow, particularly as it continues to ramp up its acquisitions…

Which could place WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) in the perfect risk-reward “sweet spot” for investors…

But this window of opportunity may be closing, as analysts expect its valuations to increase to a range more in line with its peers once the US IPO happens.",

Not that I'm complaining about seeing green, but I was promised like 7% a year, not 10% in three months. After every dip, it goes up even more. So this is all a little confusing to me. Is it just the ract that stocks have gone up overall due to the pandemic? And will there be like a 10% in the next few months? 

Not asking anyone to predict the future, but I'm just wondering about why this is happening and if it's reasonable to predict a big fall in the future. People who have done this for longer can probably answer why this is happening haha",

Long term your average return should be in the 7% range, but very rarely will you actually get exactly 7% in a given year. 

But right now the stock markets are going wild. Probably because everyone has been trapped at home with nothing else to do but invest, if only for entertainment sake.

This week is filled with earnings calls from the biggest companies in the world, I expect them to either barely beat these extremely high expectations or be just under , either or . ( except for amd , they might go to the moon)  Regardless, this week in my opinion will be the last week of any major corrections , after this week we should have a pretty nice bull run as a lot of stocks consolidated at new higher levels last week after 2-3weeks of running(well except the crypto minners... I lost a lot of cash with my options smh)  . To be honest , after that little correction plus the quickie by biden , most stocks tested new levels of support and bounced back .

Im going to assume J pow will say the same thing he has been saying for the last 2 months about not increasing rates and that this inflation we see now is temporary ( ex-lumber). Tbh i really dont see him saying anything that could actually spook the markets.( If you know what he could possibly say to spook the markets please share your thoughts) Its just that , the unemployment data showed a steady push towards full employment by coming in a little higher than expected but not enough to really cause the market to be concerned. The J&J vaccine mini halt will add some extra time b4 75% of the US population will be  vaccinated  ( estimates are end of august with the current rate vaccination is going) . The reason Im saying the 75% thing is because one of top guys from one of the fed banks said that people could expect the start of tapering after 75% of the population had gotten vaccinated , but we will see.

Also , I just had to put the bank stress test on here rq because... Guys this isnt going to cause a damn short squeeze the banks already knew this was coming up , hence they had that massive bond sale . These banks want to pass the stress test and get that a ok to be able to buy back their shares( BAC is buying about 25billion back) .

&#x200B;

What are yalls views about this week and May?(May starts next week!!)

And ZKIN is back at it as since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has grew by impressive 24% in value!

ZKIN was on very thin ice few days ago, but it has managed to to find buying support as we've expected for a while.

Let's not get too optimistic as this is only an oversold bounce and we have no confirmation yet of this going higher.

Still, we think that the inverted head and shoulders pattern on 2h time frame is saying one thing -  ""This is an oversold correction indeed, but I look for trend to stay an uptrend from now on.""

About the price action on 15m time frame.

a)
Last time we've said that the price is headed to $6 area where a resistance will be found.

b)
And the price broke to $6.08 and has formed an ascending triangle breakout formation that has broken up to the upside today.

c)
The price broke out to $6.52, from where a mild correction to $6.15 was seen. As the price found support on 20 EMA, strong uptrend has remained strong and continued breaking into a new local high at $7.04 per share!

As the price stands now, current support is at $6.70 while resistance is at $7 and $7.30.

RSI is calling for a correction as yes, bullish momentum is present but the price has created a new high, while RSI created lower high.

MACD is in a strong buying wave with gains keeping on increasing.

Overall short term trend is a strong uptrend as the price is riding highly above 20 EMA.

Based on this short term outlook, we look for a correction to 20 EMA at $6.40 before any more upside as RSI is suggesting.",['ICE']

robinhood - beginning friendly, easy to use

webull - more detail

fidelity - private owned

schwabb - publicly owned

vanguard - investor owned

At first I thought they all have different types of stocks you can invest?  But now I think they can invest in any stock?  I keep reading all sorts of pros and cons of each

i figured vanguard was the way to go just because its investor owned, but finding it incredibly confusing to look at.  Been looking it up here and seeing fidelity and schwabb is easier to use?  I figure maybe use fidelity then transfer to vanguard in future?  Can you just transfer stock from one platform to another?

Lastly, robinhood and webull seems to be often grouped together

While the other 3 are grouped.

myi5rn,,StockMarket,post,1619386304,"$XL Fleet Technical Analysis and DDAlright folks, here's some DD and Technical Analysis on $XL (XL Fleet). Quick background, as some of you may know, $XL was the target of a short attack by Muddy Waters earlier this month, causing the price to crash nearly 75% from highs. This creates a huge buying opportunity for the new longs who get in during the rock bottom prices. Currently, the short interest on $XL is at its highest since January of this year, which allows for a potential squeeze to fuel the next run.

https://preview.redd.it/1ghfnebb1ev61.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c383c27bf28d75d870ddfc7bfc38bb58b0f4039

I'm a fan of keeping the TA simple and not complicated, this allows for more predictable entries and exits imo. If you look at my chart, you can see that Just recently $XL broke out of its downward flag formation due to back to back positive news via PR. This trend breakout commonly results in a run up and retrace of the prior base level ($21ish in this case, ex: $ROKU, $BBBY, etc)). That's almost 3X (200%+) upside just based on pure technicals. Combined with the possibility of a short squeeze and we could see a pop to $30s or higher.

Now for the DD. The current marketcap for XL Fleet is just $1 billion. They have roughly $408 million in CASH on hand, with literally zero debt. That means they have almost HALF their marketcap in just cash, and can survive for many years at their current spending rate. This basically reduces the possibility of dilution or an offering being raised by XL Fleet and eliminates any bankruptcy concerns. The company itself has been in business since 2008 and has been consistently having sales and growing revenue + profit since inception. They just partnered with Dickinsons Fleet services, which will enable them to grow rapidly while committing to providing service and repair to all their ever growing electrified fleets. The best part about their business is that they are not limiting themselves to fleet electrification, they are also expanding to installing charging stations and fleet data intelligence. Those are two huge industries on their own as you can see by checking Chargepoint and other charging station companies marketcap and revenue. XL Fleet just won a contract to install 1000 charging stations at UBS arena, and if successful, will see many more to contracts like these to come.

The fundamentals combined with the EV industry being a hot topic in this administration will continue to propel the business and see it grow exponentially in the coming months and years. Their customer base includes companies like Verizon, Coca Cola, and many more. If they reach $21, their marketcap will still be just $3 billion in an ever growing speculative sector. I can see the company easily justifying a $5-6 billion marketcap which would put it around $35-42 range.

Overall, I feel like the short attack by Muddy Waters combined with the recent SPAC selloff generated a huge once in a while buying opportunity to get in super cheap on XL Fleet, with limited downside risk and significant upside potential. To me its like getting in $GME at rock bottom. I'm all in.

TLDR: I like the stock. I'm Long 8k shares and May 21 $11 calls.",['WAT']

mzkumu,,wallstreetbets,post,1619516974,"Markets crash every time Oreo releases an even greater-stuffed cookieThe increasingly-depraved debuts of Oreos with more stuffing indicate unstable amounts of greed and leverage in the system, serving as an immediate indicator of that the makings of a market crash are in place. Conversely, when the Oreo team reduces the amount of icing in their treats, markets tend to have great bull runs until once again society demands to push the boundaries of how much stuffing is possible.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Oreo_varieties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets

1974: Double Stuf Oreo released. Dow Jones crashes 45%. FTSE drops 73%.

1987: Big Stuf Oreo released. Black Monday, a 20% single-day crash and a following bear market.

1991: Mini Oreo introduced. Smaller icing ratios coincide with the 1991 Japanese asset price bubble, confirming the correlation works both ways and a reduction of Oreo icing may be a potential solution to preventing a future crash.

2011: Triple Double Oreo introduced. S&P drops 21% in a 5-month bear market

2015: Oreo Thins introduced. A complete lack of icing causes an unprecedented bull run in the S&P for years

2019: The Most Stuf Oreo briefly introduced. Pulled off the shelf before any major market damage could occur.

2021: The Most Stuf Oreo reintroduced. Market response: ???","['SPGI', 'DOW']"

EDIT: OP has only a few min left to verify the position or ban.

EDIT 2: OP provided the link so I'm doing the math now  [https://imgur.com/a/LpcYIi6](https://imgur.com/a/LpcYIi6)

EDIT 3: OP only provided trade verification of 173,861 shares. We do not know his cost average or when he purchased the other 252,800 shares. Still waiting for a response.

FINAL EDIT:  OP added the rest of his trades here  [https://imgur.com/a/3RQBy8U](https://imgur.com/a/3RQBy8U) I did the rough math on his trades and seems like the cost average $3.56 checks out. Y'all can check it and do the math too. 

**OP very rare we are this patient and you were kinda being an asshole about it at first.** The screenshot was already shit and should have been removed.

mze2n2,,wallstreetbets,post,1619489317,"Remember Gamestop's share offering? It closed today.Remember when GameStop mentioned it would sell a maximum of 3,500,000 shares, or $1bln, whichever came first? Many did some reverse maths and determined they *MUST* expect the share price to hit $1b/3.5m=**$285.71428571**. Others said ""or just 1m shares at $1,000 each."" Still others (now this is the group I belong to) said this means fuck all for price expectations. This had nothing to do with GameStop peeking through the veil and determining a short squeeze was imminent and everything to do with seizing the opportunity to raise cash.

Welp, the [3.5m shares came and went today](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-latest-big-day-picks-up-steam-after-hours-with-551-million-stock-offering-11619474789), and the price went UP.

[Cramer actually sided with AMC and GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/jim-cramer-amc-gamestop-share-offerings-are-longterm-positives.html) about this being a good move, although we saw the sentiment on Reddit having great disdain for AMC's version and overall the sentiment was a majority positive for GameStop and realizing RC's vision, although [GME stock price took a **-12% hit** when this was initially announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/05/gamestop-shares-drop-12percent-after-announcing-plan-to-sell-up-to-3point5-million-shares.html).

GME is currently **up +12%** for the day (coincidence? *Cohencidence?*) and an additional +9% in AH with a peak that tickled the idea of breaking $200 at around... get ready for this... 4:20pm.

Today $AMC has broked above the descending triangle formation in the daily chart (Check Finviz or whatever tool you want) and a little after $GME has experienced the same trend. Breaking above the SMA and both currently spiking in After Market.

If these levels consolidate in this week and the next, both of these stocks can experience Another Bull run to previous highs.

mzp7sl,gw1v765,wallstreetbets,comment,1619532395,"New report this morning from undisclosed source follows rumors from last week of increased capital gains taxes.

**Key Points:**

* **Ending ""step-up basis"" for inheritances.**   the “step up in basis” loophole allows heirs to use the market value of assets at the time of inheritance rather than the actual purchase price as the cost basis for capital gains when the holdings are sold.  ending this would mean much higher tax bills for wealthy estates
* **Increase of tax rate for the highest bracket (>$400k) from 37% to 39.6%** - impacting around 1% of taxpayers that earn in this bracket.  (Reminder that US income tax is **progressive**, which means that only income over $400k is taxed at the 39.6% rate.)
* **$80B in new funding for the IRS** to audit wealthy individuals and companies, that some are estimating could generate $700B in revenue.   The IRS has long been calling for more resources, with Commissioner Chuck Rettig stating at a congressional panel that as much as $1T in taxes go uncollected each year.
* **Biden to reveal his ""American Families Plan"" to Congress on Wednesday (4/28/21)** - expected to cost from $1 to $1.8T - expected to feature funding for paid leave, childcare, and education.

>At long last, Mind Medicine Inc. (MindMed) is getting uplisted from the OTCMKTS to the Nasdaq under the new ticker $MNMD. MindMed is a pre-revenue, clinical-stage pharma company that is undoubtedly the best pure-play in terms of psychedelics. Boasting international research collaboration and an extensive pipeline, this company is nothing if not novel and exciting. Its leading products include 18-MC, a safe Ibogaine derivative that can be used to treat addiction, and non-hallucinatory LSD Microdosing for the treatment of adult ADHD and anxiety. With a TAM far north of a conservative $30B, this company has a bright future. What’s going on with all the dilution? Why did the CEO and co-founder recently dump 56% (*Source: Simply Wall St., 2021/04/26*) of his shares? Is this actually a good investment?


***SWOT Analysis:***


**Strengths**


* First-mover pure play in the psychedelic pharmaceutical space.

* Social media and retail driven with retail investors holding over 93% of the shares outstanding.

* The war on drugs has officially ended and sentiment is more positive.

* Extensive pipeline with LSD Microdosing, 18-MC Ibogaine derivative, and many others.

* Minimal side effects of psychedelics; non-addictive.


**Weaknesses**


* Clinical stage company dependent on investors.

* No revenue, no income for 5+ years to come.

* Share dilution pending (CA$500M Shelf).

* Entire pipeline is based on Schedule-1 illicit substances.

* If first drug fails to gain FDA NDA in the future, casts doubt on the rest.


**Opportunities**


* Insane TAM at probably well over $30B. It’s tough to gauge the true TAM with mental health issues being under-reported.

* First-mover reputation and recognition.

* Novel treatment paradigms with psychedelics.

* International collaboration across US, Canada, and EU creates a wider net for possible approvals (even if conservative US FDA does not approve treatments).


**Threats**


* CEO and co-founder recently dumped 56% (*Source: Simply Wall St., 2021/04/26*) of his shares. Negative public perception from this.

* Always the possibility of funding issues if there are delays.

* Legal hurdles not being able to be overcome.

* Time is money. The timeline for this company is very, very long.


>**TL;DR** The reality is that this stock is 5+ years away from meaningful revenue and who knows how long from profitability. However, with one of the thiccest pipelines I've ever seen, retail holding >93% of the float, and psychedelics being literal social media bait, this is going to be one you're going to want to keep in your radar to trade on clinical news drops over the years.

Sure big players might be dumping for profit but I can't see them dumping 600,000 shares at a time to cause a 75 cent drop. Why not spread the sell out over 20 minutes or an hour to maximize profit? I am holding 1000 shares until at least closer to the announcements coming at the end of the week, and maybe until acquisition options are actually on the table. 

For better or worse this is by far the biggest bet in my portfolio.  I bought and sold mvis many times yesterday and bought after hours at 29.3 with a larger buy than I ever have.

mz5e3m,,wallstreetbets,post,1619464294,"$GME Technical Analysis: Waves go BrrrHi Fam, its me, Fam. 

There is something going on with GME and it may be  **imminent**
This is my interpretation of GME thru wave counting/elliotwave. 

Refer to this image first : https://i.imgur.com/CR0OiQJ.jpg

From a yearly point of view, we have accomplished wave 1(A) and wave 2(B) colored blue for those colored blind (idk how that works). We are in the mist of forming wave C.  That will be interpreted in the following paragraph. From this standpoint, we have strong support level at 23.6 fib level (priced 142.79). It was actually broken, but that level was a *test* to see how far it will go down. It found support again (twice) on several different locations (weeks later) This is very important because the psychology of the market (investors) show a threshold and now pointing towards a bullish movement - even though we were consolidating. Now, per elliot wave analysis, Wave 3 is the **BIGGEST** wave of the 5 wave formation. It  must past the high of 488.51 in order to be called a elliot wave 3 or C wave. There are several *mini* resistance levels we must past but as I am typing, we pushed past two of them. The next important level of all is Price $200 which is surprisingly at fib level 38.2. Thats a magic number for later. We can *predict where Wave 3 may end* and that number is 504 .34- 531.72. (math not included) 

Refer to image: https://i.imgur.com/cw86Lhx.jpg
This image basically tells me half time is over and the bell just rung. The pendant is forming or has already formed.  Its a signal and confirms the psychoanalysis of market (retail investors and all) that there is a upward movement. However, there needs to be a stimulus or break out movement out. This image now focuses on our micro analysis of wave 3 (C). Wave 1 of wave C has completed and assumingly so, wave 2 (b) of bigger wave 3 is consolidating (pendant). Quick fib analysis: We find resistance at fib level 23.6 (priced at 169.26). Then again we have fib level 38.2 hovering around price 200 (remember this - important later down the road). If we want some kind of breakout, we need to close above 200, followed by some stimulus (upward movement factor). In addition, this pendant formed a higher lows but also lower highs (consolidation). 

On the daily,
* if we close above 169-170, thats a great start
* Then close above 200, price movement is building momentum for wave C - which should have the biggest momentum of all 5 waves
* Theoretically, it needs to close above 351.90 to confirm wave 3(C), but remember thats only the smaller version of Wave 3. 

If this happens, it can theoretically push bigger wave 5 to around 800 (depends on market volatility and demand) to XXXXs. 

 TLDR: Wave 3's forming. There is a pressure on GME market and it may be bullish movement from now on. Consolidation may be done if it can close above micro support levels. 

Im not a financially literate to be a financial advisor, but just shooting blanks, i think. My mom told me I lost a chromosome when she was dividing me during meiosis (not mitosis per SFWsosa93)  phase.

mzkgr9,,wallstreetbets,post,1619515249,"The Technicals Behind GameStop #5Hello everyone,  
the price of the GameStop stock (GMEUSD) finally broke out of a sideways movement and is currently looking for new highs ($185.00 at this moment) in the pre-market. We are looking forward to the US market opening in \~4 hours. In order to be prepared for the undergoing trend-change, we are going to have a quick look on the chart.  


[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/x\/Bbhn1dBH\/](https://preview.redd.it/1i18187enov61.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b0b6345d359ec3fdb37790c3ea59a4b03438956)

The full chart is visible [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Bbhn1dBH/). We can see that the price was accumulating in a symmetrical triangle from March to this date. As soon as the price is hitting the demand zone (red channel), we see a strong reaction from the buyers on the market. While the sellers are preventing the buyers from making higher highs, we can also observe that the buyers support the price with higher lows - which results in the symmetrical shape.  
This is a simplification of how the buyers & sellers are acting on the market, and they are finally the ones who decide where the price is going next. The decreasing volume confirms this behavior. This breakout will drag more interest into the market, and we will see more price action (more volume).  


Now we're looking at a change of structure/ sentiment. The buyers were basically stronger than the sellers, and they managed to push the price above the previous high at $165.00, which is the first sign of an upwards trend. When we're looking at an upwards trend, we want to price to make higher highs and higher lows, supported by increasing volume. We want the market participants to confirm the breakout with trading action.  


Buyers & Sellers usually look for previous price peaks to either leave the market or to enter the market. So we can expect small retracements at the previous highs (horizontal lines), followed by further price movements towards the next high.  
This upwards trend is currently supported by the MA200 (grey line), which is a great entry for those wo might want to join the party.

Here is what I learned:I'm a fairly experienced trader..but I felt like I was missing something.  I knew there had to be a secret to making the highest returns but I couldn't figure out what that secret was.

One day I was watching CNBC and heard this ad, ""The secret to making the highest returns is knowing which stocks are about to make the biggest moves...""

Right then I knew I had to pick up my landline phone and called in to FOMO order the book and companion DVD. I mean how could I pass it up...the book was free  I just had to pay the low price of $9.99 for shipping and handling.

Here is what happened next:

1. I went to my local Radio Shack to pick up the newest DVD player. I ended up getting a Sony.
2. I listed my Magnavox VHS player on eBay
3. I checked my mail daily, and finally when the items arrived I ripped them open, devoured the book and watched the DVD

# What did I learn? And how can you score major profits just like the Najarian bros?

&#x200B;

1. at 12:30 PM EST, login to your favorite brokerage app and buy thousands of options on literally any stock you want
2. At 12:50 PM EST, go on CNBC and mention during your segment of ""Unusual Options Activity"" the EXACT SAME options you just bought.
3. At 12:51 PM EST, sell those calls that you bought 31 minutes ago, after people watching the show FOMO buy them and you make a nice profit.
4. You do this again, because you always give two stocks with unusual activity on TV.

The book and DVD did not mention what role the pony tail plays in your success.

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

This week, more so than others, is extra spicy, with all of $FAAMG (I kicked out Netflix for Microsoft after their disgusting showing last week) reporting alongside loads of other mega cap companies. There is a *stupid* amount of money to be made this week, for traders of all skill levels and styles.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades, [**I’ve compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, it would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don’t know which way it’s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it’s gonna fly.

- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.

- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we’ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don’t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.

- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a “safe” gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we’re not over-leveraged.

- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It’s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**","['GD', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'FB', 'NFLX', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'CME']"

P/E ratio is 11. S&P average P/E ratio is 28. It's 140% undervalued here. 

Paramont+ is not being considered in current analyst's evaluation. Even if paramount+ becomes 20% the size of Netflix or 30% the size of Disney+, that's an extra 100% market cap alone.

VIAC raised funds when the stock was $85. Institutions won't sell their shares under $85.

Current IV is super low, a 100% jump in price on VIAC is equal to 800% gain in options for LEAPS!! Don't have to worry about theta burn.

Earnings releases next week and includes the new Paramont+ subscriber numbers. If they beat expectations (which is currently 11 million, even though 9.5 million came from CBS All Access) this stock will fly.

Microsoft leads in augmented reality hardware with its holo-lens and could use Lidar sensors to further improve its environment mapping. Just in February '21 Microsoft released its industrial edition model of the lens so it's still in active development. These guys currently use camera sensors for the HoloLens based on the Kinect, but as they want to lead in industrial augmented reality applications, there are still advantages to lidar systems that they do not use. As an example, the current 3D-object resolution is not high enough to detect my Micro-penis (coincidence?), therefore it is missing out on potential applications in the pornographic industry. Imagine buying an ogre of a hooker that actually looks like Shrek thanks to holo-lens. $MVIS can make this happen. There were rumors of acquisition back in September that Microsoft denied, however they were lying because Bill Gates planted microchips in their vaccines probably.

TLDR;
More sensors = more rockets. This is a marriage counselling service for cucks. $MVIS moon.

""UBS said it exited its remaining Archegos positions earlier this month""

Hard to imagine much if any liquidations are left. With that said, we may finally see a big recovery for VIAC and other Archegos held stocks.

mznbvw,,wallstreetbets,post,1619526463,"COVID's Massive Effect on the Semi-Conductor Market: What This Means for Electronics Manufacturers on Earnings Week Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. 

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. 

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. 

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. 

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.","['MSFT', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'GPS']"

This post is just to share what I have been tracking since I first started trading options in GME.  Every week or so I've been keeping track of option prices at different strikes.  When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week.  When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%.  That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130.  As you can see in this chart, the options market is not pricing in a big move anytime soon.  The expected $ movement week to week has been getting smaller and smaller.  

&#x200B;

[Call Option Data.  Source: I personally gather it on those dates through Etrade.](https://preview.redd.it/vr9m0ff98jv61.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d39ec5abcaf2a85d2238fc9e517d56c899825e8)

What do we do with this information?  If you own shares or options then you can feel a little more comfortable that it's not going to drop to $50 overnight as CNBC would have you believe.  They parade idiots on their shows as Analysts (aka experts).  Keep in mind they are experts of history and have no predictive value.  Same for most people.  You could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 - $100 range as they are cheap right now.   Also, keep in mind as I stated in my previous post that the cheaper options b/c the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options.  Gamma pressure easier to manifest.  If the stock ever does drop below $100 I imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity.

Everyone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by Ryan Cohen.  The first sign of that may be on the June earnings call.  

I won't update this every week but when I see a change in trend or a big move in IV maybe I'll post again.  Good luck!! 🚀💎 🙌
