Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

He was a lawyer living in Seattle, no one aside from a few close family members were aware of his wealth. He was fascinated by the stock market and thought of himself as shepherding over his wealth that would eventually go back to benefit the rest of society. 

Here are a few stories you can read about him:

I’ve researched up and coming sectors, and likely players in that field to help give you some inspiration.

Now just because a stock is on this list does not mean it’s a good investment choice, but it’s a good place to start looking.

**As always, please do your own research before investing into any security, and only invest what you can afford to lose.**

# Why have the markets been volatile?

A few things have been at play to cause the market to both go up, and down.

* Doubts growing around the vaccine roll-out, fuelled by export bans from the EU and India, along with the looming threat of a 3rd wave in Europe, saw bond yields dip earlier in the week. This helped support the price of growth/tech stocks earlier in the week.
* Tensions between the US and China increased, and US regulators renewed their threats to delist Chinese stocks quoted in the US. This saw Chinese tech giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba all drop significantly *(there’s actually a bit more to this story now, rumour has it that a hedge fund or family office blew up last week, creating a fire sale).*
* Energy stocks & related commodities shot-up as a massive ship blocked the Suez canal, blocking the fastest shipping route linking Europe and Asia.
* Quarter-end rebalancing for many asset-management firms will see a flow out from equities to bonds, as many have to maintain proportions of equities-to-bonds in their portfolios, which would have been thrown out of whack given the rally stocks have been on since the start of the year.Money put into stocks was at its lowest since Dec 20 ($4.1Bn) while money flowing into cash instruments was at its highest since Apr 20 ($45.6bn), [TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) saw its third largest inflows ever.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-flows-bofa/investors-rush-into-cash-at-fastest-pace-since-april-2020-bofa-idUSKBN2BI16H?il=0)

# What does this mean for the weeks ahead?

Definitely more volatility, especially as COVID outlooks yo-yo. Prices likely to dip lower, particularly for the highly overvalued growth stocks (EV anyone?) and a continued rotation from tech/growth stocks into cyclical stocks and inflation-protected bonds.

# What about the longer term?

The outlook is better. A return to normal *(how many times have you heard that saying now?)* is now more tangible, as more vaccines get announced and administered *(*[*Biden has doubled targets to 200m doses in his 100 days in office*](https://www.ft.com/content/a1accbdf-0010-426c-9442-feb73b5c8a1d)*, UK have confirmed they are on target to offer a vaccine to all adults by July, with nearly half already administered a first dose)*. After all, the whole worry of rising inflation is due to rapidly recovering economies.

This makes these few weeks a perfect opportunity to research and pick out some long term prospects, to purchase at these subdued prices and hold through the volatility.

To help you do that, i’ve researched up and coming sectors, and likely players in that field to help give you some inspiration. Now just because a stock is on this list does not mean it’s a good investment choice, but it’s a good place to start looking.

# Cloud computing

**What is it?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking and software over the internet. Typically, You only pay for the services you use, and can obtain extra resources or computing power within minutes, meaning quicker set-up and lower operating costs with more flexibility.

**Why should I be excited?**

Cloud computing has seen tremendous growth over the last decade. Revenues grew from $197Bn in 2018 to $266Bn just 2 years later. This is forecasted to grow to $354Bn by 2022 as take-up scales.

Cloud computing is already a go to solution for internet services like large websites (Reddit), content delivery platforms (Netflix, Spotify) and start-ups. This is driven by its simplicity, flexibility, cost advantages and an ever-growing number of solution services ([AWS offering pre-built fraud detection solutions for example](https://aws.amazon.com/fraud-detector/?nc2=h_ql_prod_ml_fd)).

Larger, more traditional corporations have been also making the move to cloud computing, albeit at a slower pace. This could be due to security hesitancy *(worries of hacks, leaks etc)*, legal requirements *(GDPR requires personal data to be stored in the same jurisdiction, FDA has stringent requirements for cloud usage)* or the right solution not available currently.

These barriers are reduced constantly as the sector advances, meaning take up of cloud becomes easier, and more necessary, as computing requirements increase.

Additionally, with increasing internet bandwidth and speed across the world, new cloud solutions also become more feasible. Take **cloud gaming** for example. Rather than having to build and maintain your own gaming PC, [Shadow](https://shadow.tech/en-gb/) provide a high-end PC to play with, streamed over your internet connection, all for a minimal monthly fee. Since the company maintain the infrastructure, in a few years time when more powerful PC parts come out, they will upgrade that infrastructure for you.

**Relevant Stocks**

* Amazon (AMZN)
* Microsoft (MSFT)
* Google (GOOGL)

No cloud computing list is complete without the 3 stocks above, between them and their services (AWS, Azure and GCP) they absolutely dominate the cloud market.

* Digital Ocean (DOCN)
* Salesforce (CRM)
* DataDog (DDOG)
* Cloudflare (NET)
* Twilio (TWLO)
* Dropbox (DBX)

# Clean energy

**What is it?**

Clean energy is useful energy that is collected from renewable, zero emission sources, most of which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

There is a large crossover between clean and renewable energy sources, although they are not the same. Uranium for example is classed a clean energy source *(due to low atmosphere pollution)* but is not renewable.

**Why should I be excited?**

This one is pretty obvious, globally people are moving towards more sustainable uses of the Earth’s resources, to ensure we don’t damage the planet even more.

Governments are becoming more stringent with energy regulations, and companies are now measured by ESG standards *(Environmental, Sustainable and Governance).*

As clean energy technology improves, it will without a doubt become more widely used and adopted. It has rapidly picked up over the last year, accelerated by Biden being voted into power, and a funding frenzy meaning more capital is being pumped in than ever before.

This extract from the FT summarises the breadth of this sector well:

>From [new battery storage technologies](https://www.ft.com/content/fb1fa29b-7f2b-448b-ba47-05f16eccad97) to sustainable aviation fuel, lab-grown meat and low-carbon concrete, investors are rushing to put money behind [renewable energy producers and other companies fighting climate change](https://www.ft.com/content/0a3d0af8-7092-44c3-9c98-a513a22629be).

Michael J Burry has also recently gone in on clean energy, through Uranium holdings, [here is a good post discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4w42/michael_burry_appears_to_shift_focus_to_clean/).

**Relevant stocks**

* URA
* URNM
* NLR
* ICLN
* TAN
* BEP
* Nextera (NEE)

The majority of these are ETFs, which would be my suggested way of investing into clean energy, given that most of the companies in this sector are still immature, and you would need to allocate a large amount of time into researching them to select the right one.

# Genetic therapy and genomics 

**What is it?**

Genetic therapy is an approach that uses a person’s genes to treat or even prevent diseases. There are several different types of therapy, such as replacing a mutated, disease-causing gene with a healthy version, getting rid of a mutated gene that isn’t working properly and even introducing a new gene into the body to fight off diseases.

**Why should I be excited?**

While still in very early stages, and likely to take the longest to develop compared to the other sectors I’ve discussed, this one can have tremendous pay-off.

So far, two therapies have managed regulatory approval, Novartis’ Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy, and Spark’s Luxturna for a rare form of genetic blindness. More are waiting their turn. To give you an idea of the magnitude of diseases gene therapy can solve, here are some recent developments:

* Earlier in the year, German scientists reported they were able to use gene therapy to [help paralyzed mice run again](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/europe/german-scientists-made-paralysed-mice-run-again-through-gene-therapy.html). 
* Chinese scientists develop gene therapy which could [reverse the effects of ageing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-genes-ageing-idUKKBN29P02V).
* Trials are ongoing with CRISPR technology to[ tackle leukemia and lymphoma](https://synbiobeta.com/crispr-clinical-trials-a-2021-update/)

**Relevant stocks**

* CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)
* Invitae Corp (NVTA)
* Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)
* Agilent Technologies (A)
* Editas Medicine (EDIT)
* Bio-Rad (BIO)

# Artificial Intelligence

**What is it?**

Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

Artificial General intelligence (AGI) which attempts to emulate a more broad level of intelligence, similar to humans, is still a fair way away.

However, Narrow Artificial Intelligence (what most people refer to when mentioning today’s technology) which is good at performing a specific task, like [playing a game of poker](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/145), or [faking videos of Tom Cruise](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/deepfake-videos-of-tom-cruise-show-just-fast-its-improving), has come on leaps and bounds, and is an area of both massive funding and development.

**Why should I be excited?**

AI has already become an integral part of technology solutions. Ranging from recommending Youtube videos, powering FaceID and enhancing photos to self-driving tech, property heating optimisation and trade execution optimisation.

Believe it or not, the technology is still relatively young, the first working deep learning algorithm being purchased by Google in 2012 *(oh, you don’t believe it was that recent?* [*read this article then*](https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/)*).*

There is still a tremendous amount of potential to be gained from AI algorithms, with uses in pretty much every industry imaginable, from manufacturing, to health care and social media.

**Relevant stocks**

This one is trickier than you think, lots of companies use AI, but there aren’t many *pure-play AI* stocks, especially since up and coming technology tends to get purchased by the big players at early stages.

ETFs in such a fast moving world would be a good option in this case.

* IBM (IBM)
* Palantir (PLTR)
* Baidu (BIDU)
* C3.ai (AI)
* ARKQ
* IRBO

mf5os6,,stocks,post,1616953160,"WAHT'S GOING ON?? Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in ‘unprecedented’ block trade selloff – mediaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly sold $19 billion worth of shares in Chinese tech and US media companies. Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. 

Continue...

“I’ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,” portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg. 
Senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move “highly unusual,” adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.
Another issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with “forced deleveraging,” the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don’t know “whether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.”","['VIAC', 'MS']"

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

mf6a9g,,stocks,post,1616954860,"I save my entire income and can't stop losing moneySorry for my english, it's not my first language.

So I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera.

The thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.

A while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the ""year of recovery"", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i ""buy the dip"" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.

I honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.

How can I stop losing all of my income? Thanks.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: I'm adding some context on the chilean market below. I tried to be as concise as possible, I hope it's good enough.

I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.

2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.

It's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.

October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.

Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself ""it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!""

Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events. 

That's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.

I took a look at IPSA, and although the IPSA haven’t done much in the past 10 years, but it’s up 8 times in the past 26 years, you would actually have done pretty well with a 30 year time horizon. Now I have no idea what is going on with the ECH. It seems to do a really bad job of actually tracking the index. Do you have any idea of why this is?

I don’t know anything about the economics of Chile, so you probably knows better then me if you should be bullish on the Chilean economy.

In any case I think you are doing the right thing by trying to diversify outside of Chile, to the best of your ability. If you can try and find a fund that tracks indexes from other countries, and be aware of fees or hidden costs. The fund (or fintech) could easily be ripping you off.

If you can’t diversify internally you might want to look into bond or other fixed income vehicles. I generally don’t recommend fixed income in the environment, but if you are limited to Chile and don’t think the economy is going anywhere, or they can’t attract international investors, fixed income might be your best option. You can also consider if investing in real estate is an option. You can also do a split between bonds and stocks.",

mf6kdm,,stocks,post,1616955654,"Jerome Powell and the 2% inflation promise. FOMC in a nutshell.On March 17, 2021 at the FOMC event, the FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated that he expect to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2024, even as the FED has upgraded their US growth forecasts because of a massive fiscal stimulus and an accelerating vaccine rollout.

 
Powell precisely refers to a ""…full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. 
… achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."" 

 
Further he adds that their ""…ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.""
So basically the unemployment rate is now forecast to fall to 4.5% by the end of the year instead of 5%. On the other side PCE inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% compared with the rise to 1.8% predicted in December.
But Fed officials expect the bump in consumer prices to be temporary, with PCE inflation falling back in 2022-2023, even as unemployment drops further.

 
 
And regarding to the federal funds rates the FED continues to ""expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 0.25 percent target range""
So they will continue to increase their ""holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month""

 
So the Fed has managed to maintain rock-bottom interest rates ""…with inflation running persistently below 2 percent"" in order to ""achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent"" until the US reaches full employment, with inflation hitting 2 per cent and being on track to exceed that target. The central bank also reiterated that it would continue to buy bonds at a rate of $120bn per month until “substantial further progress” was made.

 
And they ""will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.""
An approach similar to the famous Mario Draghi ""Whatever it takes"" to save Europe in 2012, from a deep economic crisis.

 
As a result of this policy the upgrades to the forecasts from Fed officials were significant. In fact back in December they predicted 4.2% growth this year, while now they have raised that estimate up to 6.5% (+2.3%), which would be the fastest economic expansion since 1984.

 
What we can say is that this sharp upgrade to the FED's summary of economic projections will certainly generate doubts to the central bank's dovish policy.

 
During his speech Powell reiterates many times that ""The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.""
And that the FED has provided essential support to households, businesses and communities, and the recovery in economic activity since last spring is due to ""an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions.""

 
He concludes by saying that the FED understands that ""our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission… and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible""

 
So this is what happened during the last FOMC event.

> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.
*****
> “It’s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Obviously, we’ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They’re trying to figure it out.”
*****
> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.
*****
> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.
*****
> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.
*****
> “It’s in the driver’s seat right now,” said NatWest’s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.
*****
> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.
*****
> “If anything, we’re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,” he said.
*****
> # Infrastructure plan
> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.
*****
> “The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don’t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,” he said. “If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I’m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.”
*****
> Gwinn said the market has “fiscal fatigue.”
*****
> “There’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it’s going to be passed, when it’s going to be passed and whether it’s going to be passed ... It’s not tangible enough,” he said.
*****
> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.
*****
> # Rotation
> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.
*****
> “I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.
*****
> “It’s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,” he said. “I think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that’s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.”
*****
> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.
*****
> “As we’re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,” he said. “To their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy — energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they’re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.

> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month – Up 15 in a Row

> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.

> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that “work-from-home” stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.

> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April’s performance since 1953. April is DJIA’s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.

> # Historic Year for the S&P 500

> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.

> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**

> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.

> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities

> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.

> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “After likely their worst period in history, although I wasn’t around for the bubonic plague so I can’t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn’t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.”

> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market’s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the “stay at home environment” benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December—even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.

> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.

> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**

> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low – actually it’s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.

> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn’t bad either.

> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals – and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA “Sell in May”).

> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let’s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means “bearish” perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.

So what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?

I’m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.

Long Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.
I see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.

Getting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.

Travel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I’d be interested in finding good alternatives.

E-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.
MELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I’m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.

Still the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I’m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.

Shorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.

Admittedly a shorter timeframe, highly speculative bet, PSTH is tempting because of the fame of Ackman, and being back close to the initial offering price. SPACs are fast falling out of favor, yet this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of share price if a merger is announced.

Your thought on the above and other ideas?","['PYPL', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'BA']"

mf31oa,,stocks,post,1616945472,"Why I am long DKNG (and you can too)I'll do my best to keep this tight and to the point but informative.

First, positions or ban. I ran the wheel on DKNG last summer but didn't dive too deeply into the company. In January, I bought 25 shares while it was trading \~58. I bought a Jan 2022 90C and June 2021 70C, and I sold those for premium after the rebound two weeks ago.

**What DKNG Is:** Draftkings is a mobile sports betting and daily fantasy sports app. Before sports betting was opened to state-by-state legalization in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court, Draftkings' product was daily fantasy sports games. This was a gray area in terms of betting, as DFS are pay-to-play games that pay out prizes to winners, and highly addicting. Draftkings now runs a sportsbook with future and live betting odds.

**Avaliable market:** Sports betting is currently legal in [14 states and D.C.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/13/is-sports-betting-legal-in-my-state.html), representing about 25% of the U.S. population. Many states are expected to legalize it in 2021 or 2022 by either a referendum on the ballot or legislative action. Texas, New York, and California would be massive boons for the betting market, as those states contain the overwhelming majority of the outstanding U.S. population that does not yet have legalized sports betting.

**Market prospects:** Nobody really knows. [An old estimate](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/firms-say-sports-betting-market-to-reach-8-billion-by-2025-2019-11-04) claims $8 billion in revenue for the betting industry by 2025. The industry is way too new in the U.S. But here are [some numbers](https://www.sportspromedia.com/from-the-magazine/us-sports-betting-market-gambling-revenue-states-2021-data) showing the state-by-state proliferation of sports betting (I want to point out for people not familiar with sports betting that $ wagered does not equal revenue -- money must be paid out to the winners. Book revenue is excess wagering not paid out to winners):

>In October 2020, Americans legally bet an estimated US$3 billion on sports for the first time in a single month, according to the American Gaming Association. Sports betting revenue was up nationwide by 53.5 per cent year-over-year to US$237.5 million. In December alone, New Jersey set the national sports betting record for the fifth consecutive month, taking an eye-watering US$996.3 million in bets.  
>  
>Naturally, the decimation of the global sporting calendar meant revenue for the broader gaming industry was down year-over-year, falling 33.5 per cent to US$24.12 billion by October. But it is a measure of betting’s proliferation that six states – Colorado, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Dakota – generated more income from wagering for that month compared to a year ago.

This all happened with a very weak sports calendar because of the pandemic. March Madness was canceled, MLB lost 60% of its season, and NHL and NBA saw long delays. With a full sports calendar in 2021, expect U.S. wagering to climb YOY even more.

**DKNG's prospects:** Like most tech startups, Draftkings is running at a loss. This is largely due to their large marketing outlay. Their revenue is steadily increasing every quarter. They smashed Q4 earnings expectations and [raised their 2021 outlook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draftkings-lifts-2021-outlook-4q-125335607.html) as a result:

>DraftKings’ co-founder and CEO Jason Robins said, “In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw MUPs \[monthly unique payers\] increase 44% to 1.5 million and ARPMUP \[average revenue per monthly unique payer\] increase 55% to $65.”  
>  
>“We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectation for continued growth, the outperformance of our core business and newly launched states that were not included in our previous guidance,” Robins added.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The company raised its FY21 revenue guidance from a range of $750 million to $850 million to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, indicating year-on-year growth of between 40% to 55%. The revenue guidance is driven by the launch of online legal sports betting in the states of Michigan and Virginia and assumes that all professional and college sports events will take place as announced.

Draftkings has inked a new [partnership with UFC](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/draftkings-dkng-ufc-sportsbook-fantasy), and struck a [deal with DISH Network](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2021/03/dish-and-draftkings-introduce-first-of-its-kind-app-integration/?wpsrc=Organic&wpcn=Organic%20Search&wpscn=Google) that will integrate Dratkings sportbook on DISH interfaces, allowing people to bet on events directly on their TVs while they watch. Draftkings [maintains an exclusive partnership](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/06/2074556/0/en/DraftKings-Expands-Exclusive-Partnership-with-Major-League-Baseball.html) with MLB, and it's my opinion MLB may want to promote fan engagement with Draftkings as a way to recover lost revenue resulting from the pandemic (MLB was the only major sports league to lose a majority of its season last year). Draftkings also has partnerships with many teams in the NFL, NHL, and NBA, though these are often short-term partnerships and team-by-team, not league-wide.

**Stock outlook:** DKNG started trading last April. Since then, the stock is up about 265%; it is up 42% YTD. The stock hit an intraday ATH of $74.38 last Monday, March 22, and closed the week at $63.60, about 14.5% off its ATH, as part of a larger swoon for tech stocks. The stock experienced choppy trading in 2020 but has been in a strong, 5-month uptrend that started at the beginning of November 2020. Localized volatility in DKNG seems to be part of the overall market anxiety that pounded tech this month. Still, it remains up 10% since that excellent Q4 ER before February 26 trading, and IMO presents a great buying opportunity in this zone.

Some [ETFs with major exposure](https://www.etf.com/stock/DKNG) to DKNG by % allocation or share count include BETZ, BJK, QQQN, ARKW, and VO (by most shares).

**Bear case:** Draftkings undoubtedly benefited from a pandemic-induced closure of in-person betting. Reopening plays that directly challenge Draftkings' market share are MGM, WYNN, and PENN. As casinos, table games, and sportsbooks reopen for in-person betting, that may sap gambling revenues away from mobile betting.

For Draftkings to continue growing at a pace that justifies its stock price, it will need to continue growing its user base. For that to happen, more states need to continue to legalize sports betting. While governments have rarely turned down opportunities to capture new tax revenue, some may still hesitate to do so on the backs of a vice like gambling. Like marijuana, gambling legalization seems to be gaining momentum. But a ballot measure that fails to pass, or a state legislature that fails to agree on legalized sports wagering (or how to allocate the revenues generated thereby) can slow Draftkings' continued growth.","['MGM', 'WYNN', 'DFS', 'DISH']"

mf4mql,,stocks,post,1616950173,"Looking at Timing of Stock InvestmentsThere are two ways thrive in stock markets. One is to pick right stocks. Another is to time one's investments right. Stock picking is somewhat simple to measure. You just compare your performance with an index of your choice. Beating index is good, losing to index not so. But how can you measure your timing?

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/8SS9R23) my attempt to visualize my timing success. I have sliced my stock history to half-year pieces and drawn how much and how profitably I have invested in each period. The farther back in time the investment goes, the bigger the profit bars should grow. Well, not quite in my case. This chart is not a clean picture of timing alone. 2010 - 2015 I did some pretty unfortunate stock picks and it shows here. Some periods have not broken even. Still, the chart has a story to tell. 2009 was a sweet time to enter market. 2020 looks good too.

I think market timing is a way of value investing for a person with my mental capacity. I have no skill or patience to calculate intrinsic values of companies. I really don't think I can judge a company better than all the wise people playing the same game. As the picture shows, my stock picks can be horrific. However, I can recognize market crash when one comes. It is kind of easy - indexes go down 30% or more. In the bottom of the crash it seems that almost any stock is a winner. I don't even need to hit the lowest spot of the crash. The time window for good buys is wide. This is borrowing a page from Benjamin Graham.

You made a bet and it did not pay off. There's no guarantee the stock will recover in the near term, if ever. You're being sentimental about the money you lost instead of looking for a stock that has sound fundamentals and is currently growing.

Last April, oil futures went negative which created the ""Tanker Gang."" Shooting to meme status was one tanker stock, $NAT and the stock ran from under $3/share to $9/share in weeks.

Most longtime tanker investors hate on $NAT because their CEO is a promoter and goes on Cramer. They don't like the fact their Suezmax ships are old and think their book value is overstated due to the age of their ships. Book value doesn't mean much for an operating company that's not in danger of bankruptcy. It's profits, cashflow and ability to service debt that really counts. They're able to keep these old ships running, even using the latest low sulphur fuels and pay most profits earned as dividends. They're basically the slumlords of tankers and if you've ever been involved in real estate, you know those slums cash flow much better than Trump level properties.

Nevertheless, tanker stocks generally suck and tanker gang got burned after oil futures trading returned to normal.

We like short dated options plays on the tanker with the greatest meme power.

The recession and the high values resulting from low profits are not quite correct. During dotcom bubble was not an economic crisis, the prices for the companies were just extremely high. In addition, the key interest rate also influences the level of the value, low interest rates lead to high values.

Of course, it is also questionable to what extent the composition of the S&P500 has an influence on the value. More and more tech stocks (which on average have a high P/E) make up large parts of the entire index. Since this is a cross-sectional data panel, this effect is not taken into account here.

Algorithm Trading, HF Trading and the like are way more accessible to the ""institutional"" part of the market - that's the perceived ""edge"" they have. I hope this will change soon as smart individuals are hopefully working on smart invest AIs across the globe for people to have access to these trading algos on an everyday basis if they choose to.

What always existed, to my very limited knowledge, is:

\- *Informed Professionals* who are closer to some information or closer ""to the market"", aka Traders sitting at Market Makers, Analysts with direct lines and more real time access who can execute a trade in seconds, not minutes.

As an analogy to the very far past: think back to the roaring 1920s. Stock trading was a fad. However, ""Telegraphs"" delayed the ticker values by several minutes even outside the stock exchange where actual trading was executed. Today you sit at a Bloomberg terminal or your brokerage account and push a button almost in real time to buy at a certain price. The people sitting at trading desks have more direct access. This has changed vastly though as you can also get ""Level 2"" data nowadays as an individual investor. The gap is closing.

\- *Dark Pools* in one or the other way

\- *""Behind Closed Doors"" trading* (related to the above) by direct deal making. Think big instituational money lenders and the acquisition of direct Warrants, exchangable to shares under certain conditions.

\- *Whale Investors* who can influence and play the system as they know more than the individual investor (not sure that is still true in terms of knowledge, but certainly in access to analysis with more data or professionalism) or they simply have more weight on share prices when they decide to move

The ""Short Game"" has been literally played since ages ago, you can read up all about it in literature.

The long game, however has never changed and proven by Grantham and Buffet to be a very, if not *the* most successful way to be ""in the game"".

Now, how you place investments is for you to decide.

The simple way is to ""set and forget"" your bets in solid companies that you believe will further your investment and grow their value by doing the right moves, investing in the right technology and people to grow their overall business and build technological moats around them to gain an edge long term.

So if your time horizon for investing is set to 15-30 years, the long game is what wins you money.

If you're in the short, volatility, swing trading game, prepare to be rattled and stressed by your investing decisions, as this is a full-time job.

One most people actually can't do because, you know, they have a real life job that is not ""Analyst"" or ""Investment Banker"".",['GPS']

- a company issues the warrants 

- said company issues new shares if the warrant is exercised 

ELI5: options are between you and another party, usually the MM. You pay a premium to reserve a price point in the future to buy or sell a stock at, regardless of the price of the stock. When you get a warrant, the *company* issues you the warrant, and if you exercise it the company issues you new shares and they make profit. A MM is delta hedged and not trying to profit or lose from their position, so a warrant is more beneficial to a company directly. It’s basically an option but with the company itself. 

How do you make money from this mistake? You have 2 choices. You wait for the price of the stock to get closer to your strike price, and sell the warrant for a profit. Or wait for the stock price to go past your strike price, exercise the warrant to buy the stock at your price and then sell it for the market price.

mf2rs9,,stocks,post,1616944651,"Coursera: A DD IntroductionDisclaimer: This is my first DD, so please forgive any gaps, omissions, or mistakes. I welcome any and all (constructive) comments and criticisms. Secondly, as is obligatory, *this is not to be construed as financial advice*.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.  


**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

So they buy wholesale from another hedge fund all at the same price. 

Supply and demand definitely have an effect on the stock price. Squeezes are perfect examples of that. Huge demand, little supply, price fucking moons. 

In my personal opinion, the fundamentals have become less important (still important) but aren’t the keys to the mitt. With this new wave of retail investors, they invest off emotions, and feelings and other factors. The market is changing and the old cats either have to keep up, or watch from the sidelines.",
mem8e4,gsiiyfw,stocks,comment,1616881667,"The reason why dark pools work is because of demand from large institutional investors like mutual funds and pension funds.  Each dark pool sponsor has a different quantity queuing and price setting process, but because it is off exchange, the participant doesn't have to show their entire stair-step bid or ask sequence.

For example, many dark pools will close transactions based on mid of best bid-ask on the open exchanges, and exchange quantity up to the available amount in the queues.  So, in essence, the dark pools accept the price discovery of the public exchange, but as a tradeoff all desired quantities may not clear.

I'm not sure what you mean about fundamentals in this context, but a dark pool is just a different way of clearing a market.  And it functions because of the demand of large institutions for this service.

met132,,stocks,post,1616900137,"Could the semi-conductor shortage be bullish for steel producers?Edit: I'm actually looking for *any* non-bullish case for non-chinese steel producers, not just as it relates to semi-conductors. That's just part of my bullish case at the moment.

I'm beginning to think that the semi-conductor shortage could lead a very bullish scenario in the non-chinese steel producer market and I'm wondering if anyone has a reasonable case that non-chinese steel producers will decline or remain flat over the coming year or so. Here is my bull case:

Tensions have been obviously ramping up between China and the Western nations over the last few years and I believe the will be escalating pretty dramatically in the next year. While there is a lot of talk about Uighur and Hong Kong, one of the angles I believe that people are missing is the connection between the semi-conductor shortage and potential serious confrontation between the US and China. Everyone is looking at the semi-conductor play and TSM comes up a lot, but as the saying goes: buy the rumor, sell the news.

The shortage is the news, so what's the rumor?

Well, from what I understand, TSM is incredibly crucial to helping make up the semi-conductor shortfall of western nations, as outlined in [this](https://www.bloomberg.com./news/features/2021-01-25/the-world-is-dangerously-dependent-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors) article. This is very interesting, because it puts Taiwan in a particular position of strength and leverage in dealing with western nations. Why does this matter? For a long time Taiwan has been considered a ""part"" of China per the ""one-China policy"", and the current President stating that she [will never accept ""one country, two systems"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan). Further, while I know very little about internal Taiwanese politics, it seems that her party, the DPP, holds a very significant portion of the congress and considers an independent Taiwanese identity a core issue of the party. This seems to put the government of Taiwan in a position of great leverage to demand that the United State, Japan, Australia, Europe, etc, recognize Taiwan as a legitimate, independent nation, separate from China, and with a significant amount of leverage to make these demands. Why would Taiwan sell its semi-conductors to the US instead of China if the the US won't even recognize Taiwanese independence? What is the incentive when their products are in demand everywhere? This isn't even a matter of just being able to make iPhones, a lack of semi-conductors could be a serious threat to nation security (I'm not saying it is, I'm saying it's possible it is).

China, on other hand, seems to be very reluctant to give up it's control of Taiwan stating in 2019 that ""If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice but to fight at all costs"" (same Wikipedia article). In fact, I think they have already recognized that Taiwan may use this semi-conductor situation to their advantage and are backing up these words with action. It seems that the Chinese military has been being conducting large-scale military exercises in Taiwanese air space, with someone stating that they are [conducting exercises that would simulate an operation against U.S. warships that sail through the Bashi Channel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwna-china-security/taiwan-reports-largest-ever-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-idUSKBN2BI24D). And the the US already seems to be taking [its own pro-Taiwanese actions](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/us-taiwan-sign-coast-guard-deal-to-counter-china/articleshow/81702961.cms).

Let's add on to this that generally speaking, the language coming out of western governments hasn't exactly been pro-China lately. The US is talking about [sanctioning](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/22/us-allies-sanctions-china-uighers-genocide-477434) China, and Australia is talking about bringing to the WTO over [unfair trade](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news20_e/ds598rfc_21dec20_e.htm).

At this point you might be thinking, ""ok, this is a great lesson in geo-politics, but what does this all have to do with steel?"". The thing is, Chinese steel has been a very contentious issue for a very long time. China produces roughly half the world's steel, and accounts for about [15% of steel exported globally](https://legacy.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-china.pdf), and there have been constant accusations of China dumping excess steel to suppress global steel prices. If you were paying attention during the Trump administration, this was a central focus of the trade war and the tariffs on China.

If tensions continue to ramp up, I don't see why sanctions wouldn't be an order of business, and I could very much see the US demanding that it's allies boycott Chinese products, with steel at the top of that list. Combine this with the fact steel already as already hitting all-time high prices and that Biden is announcing a 3 trillion dollar infrastructure plan, it seems like we are heading into a situation where we will have a growing demand for steel and high material costs, and a potential boycott of Chinese produced-steel which could be a boon to non-chinese steel producers.

While I have read into this, I haven't read into it *super* deeply, so any commentary is appreciated.",['CMS']
met132,gsjybk3,stocks,comment,1616908548,"So, let me first say that I am bullish steel and other industrial metals.  
However, the post is asking for a bearish case for steel as it relates to the semiconductor shortage.  To that end, I'll play devil's advocate. the bearish case is that semiconductor supply to domestic automotive supply-chains are tightest.  In fact some U.S. auto assembly plants are being taken off line NOW as a result of the semiconductor chip shortage.  The auto industry is a large consumer of steel.  The chip shortage will artificially stunt U.S. auto production and an important component of domestic steel demand. This reduction in demand will result in a reduction in steel prices.

As for the geopolitical situation (tensions) with China impacting Chinese steel imports, the Section 232 tariffs enacted under Trump and widely supported and reaffirmed by the Biden administration place a 25% tariff on Chinese (among other) steel (& 10% tariffs on aluminum) imports.  This has definitely already curtailed imports, driven prices up and spurred an expansion in U.S. steel making capacity.  

BTW, Taiwan has historically and  consistently considered itself independent from Taiwan.  US has a long history of selling Taiwan arms to protect itself against China and would likely intervene to support Taiwan in the case of an actionable threat.

RSI - Massively oversold on Thursday, no surprise we had a dead cat bounce. I am also curious as to why everything rallied in the last 90 minutes across the market, not sure what to think here  
\-Bollinger bands - Tight af. Looking for breakout after that downtrend  
\-50 DMA - I'm sad we didn't hold above the 50 DMA but it's fine, it tried but ultimately lost. A expect a retest soon after financials.  
\-Trendline - as I stated above, closed Friday using the major trendline from October 30th as resistance. I'm not too concerned about it because of financials but we shall see what the financials bring  


4 hour:  
RSI - Almost oversold, on the low end. Lots of room to move up  
Bollinger bands - Thursday we oversold and did not respect the bands and got a bounce, otherwise again our dead cat bounce. I like this because this broke the falling knife.   


Daily:  
RSI - Healthy, below center. Has the room to move up or down.  
20 DMA and 50 DMA are completely in line with each other currently and have been since March 12th. I'm interested to see how this plays out. We're trading below both right now so eventually, this has to break.  
Bollinger Bands - Tightened up as best as it can prior to financials, expecting a breakout from the bottom.

# What does this company do?

3 main businesses: 

&#x200B;

**Automotive Financing Facilitation: (Clear market leader (see \* below) )**

* Helps car buyers complete car purchase procedures more efficiently and provides loan solutions.   
 
* Cango goes to the car dealers to explain content and terms of the car loan while providing assistance to the customers by completing online application and subsequent landing services.

&#x200B;

**Automotive Transaction Facilitation : (No Competitors in addressable market as per IR team)**

* Connects auto producers, individual consumers, and offline physical network channels through transaction service platform.
* Helps make automobile circulation simpler and more efficient. Cooperates with mature logistic infrastructure service providers, whose parking space are rented on a variable cost basis.
* Helps car dealers increase turnover rates, and improve logistics and warehousing financial services.

&#x200B;

**After-hours services facilitation** 

* Covers diversified insurance such as auto insurance, non-auto insurance and health insurance. It dedicates personnel to provide follow-up to guarantee professional services. 

\* I have been in constant contact with their IR team and since it was hard finding data online on their competitors in China, they said there is only one directly comparable competitor (Yixin Group (2858.HK) ). But, better profitability in Cango’s business, and it operates its own sales team while Yixin relies on third party agents. (more on this later)

&#x200B;

Mission: Work with car buyers to make car buying simple and pleasant. 

Vision: Become the preferred car buying service platform for consumers. 

&#x200B;

# Key Facts and Figures

1. Autofinancing solutions covering **ALL TESLA STORES** in Shanghai. 
2. Strategic Investment in **Li Auto** with **2.2%** equity interest. They invested in Li Auto pre IPO and this has netted them **$3.3 billion** since then, a considerable cash influx to strengthen their already formidable financial position. 
3. Strategic Partnerships with Li Auto, Weltmeister Motor, Aion, 
4. Strategic Partnerships with China's **biggest bank (ICBC)** and 13 other financial institutions. 
5. Backed by Tencent, Warburg Partners
6. Partnerships with 48,000 dealers
7. Have assisted 1,700,000 + car buyers.
8. Partnered with other 36+ industry participants.

&#x200B;

If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**. If Chinese consumers buy more cars, it is likely that there will be more auto financing. Moreover, car dealers will need more logistics solutions and efficiency if they want to get ahead of other car providers. Cango solves both problems without having any direct competitors and a robust financial position (see later). 

&#x200B;

* Cango invested in **Li auto** which has returned $3.3 billion in 2020 after Li’s IPO. Cango is still holding about 19.6 milllion shares which accumulate to a total unrealized value of $568.4 million, whilst the majority has been realized and acts as a bonus to their short-term investment assets.   
 
* They have partnered with ICBC (China’s biggest bank) and 13 other financial institutions for their auto financing business. 

**They are building a technology-based dealership management system to provide multilevel integrated guidance and services for their dealers to cover the entire car transaction process.** 

&#x200B;

# Industry Metrics

1. Cango has maintained market share despite the fallout in car sales due to the Covid pandemic. This is a great sign since 2020 was guided as a “slow year” for Cango but we saw new peaks in financials. (see later) .Car sales volume declined by 6.6 % YOY in 2020, yet Cango's market share stayed put at around 1% of total revenue / total cars sold in China. This is not a metric for their particular industry but for the entire China's car sales. 

2. Cango is the dominant player in the auto financing field. However, this field is yet to plateau. It   
only has a tamed market penetration rate when compared with US’s 80% penetration rate.   
With auto financing as their core revenue driver, it can be safely assumed that this area is yet t   
to result in diminishing revenues and the next few years will be key for Cango to continue   
expanding and maintain resilience in the market. With its key partners, it won’t be a stretch to   
assume this can be achieved. 

&#x200B;

They have an end-to-end technology enabled auto platform. Cango is making sure their technology keeps up with market trends, which is crucial for surviving in China as an emerging business.

# Why would a consumer choose Cango instead of just buying loans directly from banks? 

Cango removes bureaucracy and increases efficiency. This graphic speaks a lot in terms of consumers’ search for ease-of-use technology. 

[https://imgur.com/a/0BymFSt](https://imgur.com/a/0BymFSt)  
 



# Why you shouldn’t worry about investing in a Chinese company.

But, investing in China comes with an awful lot of caution for investors, with government regulations that are often disclosed without warnings, resulting in overnight losses in value. However, Cango is structured in a way that takes advantage of government policy. Governments in China want to transform the automotive industry by removing pollution, yet Cango only deals in cars and doesn’t produce them. Moreover, the recent crackdown of Alibaba and Alipay exemplifies the loyalty the government places in state banks. Cango has only partnered with state banks. 



# Awards and Recognition 



1. For the third year in a row, Cango was awarded the **Best Auto Finance Service** 

2. Cango Ranks among “2020 China’s Top 10 Innovators in Auto Marketplaces, Platforms and Services” 

3. Cango was awarded the Innovative Auto Finance Service Enterprises award by China 

 

# Financials

\- Blowout year, 43% increase in revenue. Both core businesses have accelerated even though this sector is cyclical and was hit due to Covid.  

\- Important thing to note is that in q4 50% of their revenue came from car trading transactions which is a drastic change since auto financing was their core revenue driver. The good thing about this is that it shows they are expanding outside of auto financing since auto financing revenues did not decline. However, we have to note that this business has lower margins, is fairly new and yet to be completely integrated. After emailing their Investor Relations team, the conversation transcribed as follows: 

Me: Thank you for your informative email, I really appreciate it. Everything is clear for me now but I have one final thing to clarify: Your network of offline dealers interact with each other through Cango and ""trade"" cars while inventory is stored at warehouses which are rented on a variable cost basis. This helps car dealers be more efficient and solve logistics problem while Cango receives commissions on this car trading business. Am I right to think along these lines? 

IR Rep: Your understanding is correct.  
 Just to be clear, our car trading business is in the early stage, the business model is that we generate the demand from our dealers, then we place orders with OEMs. We just earn the spread, not commission. The gross profit margin of car trading business is around 1% now. When we reach a certain business scale, we will optimize the profitbility and will make the model lighter by increasing the proportion of facilitation(no inventory), at that time, we can earn commissions from both dealers and OEMs side. 

\- Though Cost of revenue has increased, the cost of revenues as a percentage of relevant revenues was the same as before, cost increased to the boom in their car transaction business. 

\- They got a $3.3 billion cash influx from their investment in Li Auto which is such a bonus to their already strong balance sheet performance. 

Current Price = $8.43

P/E = 1.2 (criminally undervalued, they just announced a crazy special dividend of $1 per share)

Dividend Yield = 12.5%

Book Value = $17

Price / Book = 0.5

Price / Cash = 1.65 

Quick Ratio = 3.6 (wtf)

Current Ratio = 3.6

Debt / Equity = 0.3

Long Term Debt / Equity = 0.12 

EPS Q/Q = 1386.50%

Sales Q/Q = 173.80%

Institutional Ownership = 30.80%

ROA = 34.10%

ROE = 51.70%

Gross Margin = 46%

Operating Margin = 15.50%

Short Float = 2.25%

These numbers speak for themselves. It doesn't take an accountant to realise how undervalued this company is. If you want an in depth analysis of their balance sheet and income statement, message me because r/stocks is really annoying photos.

&#x200B;

# Management Team

[https://imgur.com/a/RgoJHRP](https://imgur.com/a/RgoJHRP)

Solid Experience from top universities. 

&#x200B;

# Price Target

I have tried to assess their fair value and revenue prediction to create a simplified future cash flow analysis of a conservative price target (assuming 15% growth in revenue and increases in costs) and a bullish price target (assuming 20-40% growth). You can find both if you message me. But from my very simplified calculation the price should be anywhere from **$16-$30.** 

&#x200B;

TLDR: 

Cango is a company that captures the behind the scenes of the entire Chinese auto market. They are the leaderrs in providing auto financing solutions and auto trading transactions. They are criminally undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of 2. They have grown EPS and net revenue every year at 40% growth. They also got a massive influx from investing in Li Auto which netted them $3.3 billion in profit. They are the top solutions partners for Tesla stores in China, VM motors and Aion and have a registered network of 48,000 car dealers. They are also on the right side of government policy since they have partnered up with the biggest bank in China and 13 other financial institutions which are state-run. 

Overall, If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**.

&#x200B;

Positions: 500 shares at $9.2.

Rule 1 was my first real exposure to investing, and now that I'm a ways down the road and have also spent time learning from many others, I still consider it a great starting point and still employ Rule 1 strategy despite broadening my knowledge.

I've spent countless hours listening to and reading Phil's stuff at this point, and I am grateful for his teaching, but there is still something I have yet to really hear him discuss and explain.

What happens when you pick a great company that has ALL the right metrics... and well... nothing happens? For reasons unknown, the stock price just never takes off and growth fails to materialize. You know you bought it undervalued (according to the numbers), and at a comfortable MOS, but it continues to just sit - undervalued - with only horizontal movement.

How long do we wait for it to take off and begin the climb of stock price eventually intersecting with the company's intrinsic value? I have no problem being patient, but I also think there's a line you cross where it's obvious that you would be better off in another company. For example, holding a stock for 10 years, seeing single digit gains, but being CONVINCED by the Rule 1 stats that it's still undervalued - well, doesn't seem like a wise use of investment capital. Even if the valuation metrics are still stellar, surely we don't just continue to hold indefinitely, right?

So what kind of time limit (or quarterly/annual performance standards) do we hold our investment choices to? (Also, has Phil actually posted discussion about this on YouTube, and I just missed it?) Thanks all!",['MOS']

megjfd,,stocks,post,1616860667,"Carnival Cruise Warning Part 4Continuing with my bearish thesis on Carnival Cruise.  New industry news just hit yesterday.

Florida Governor Ron Desantis has issued a demand that the CDC lift the sail restrictions on the cruise industry.  He has threatened lawsuits if needed.  Many seem to think this is a good thing.  I believe just the opposite.  Here is why.

1. This is very political now.  Doesn't make it right or wrong.  It just is.  Biden's CDC will not allow itself to be bullied by someone who many view to be a Trump knockoff.  It doesn't matter where you fall politically.  We have two forces that will refuse to give in and currently the CDC has the upper hand.
2. Desantis' lawsuit won't go anywhere.  The CDC will very easily be able to make its case as to why they think allowing cruising would be a safety hazard.  They will point to the virus variants, the unknowns about them and the surge in Europe.  Also a Florida University Epidemiologist is quoted saying:

*""Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist, defended the ban, saying it is still too early for cruise ships to operate. Unlike other modes of transportation, families and groups on cruises mingle and dine together for long periods, increasing the likelihood of spread, she said, and testing and symptom screening are not perfect methods of prevention. ""*

So the CDC will easily be able to make their case if a lawsuit happens.  They have many examples to give to show how they came to their decision.

3) Both the cruise industry and Gov. Desantis have stated that people should not be required to get vaccinated in order to go on a cruise.  This is just foolish on their part.  The CDC will never go for that and the public would probably agree.  Most of the bullish types on here cite vaccines as a reason Carnival will recover.  But Carnival and Desantis are both saying that vaccines shouldn't be a requirement.

Finally.  I believe that if Gov Desantis has done anything he has just brought attention to the major problem the cruise industry is having.  People smell blood in the water now.  I would not be surprised if formerly unaware investors are now getting concerned and thinking about dumping their positions until things turn around.

I am posting a link to show where I got my information.

Adding an update:

Royal Caribbean is now receiving boycott threats all because they planned a few fully vaccinated cruises.  The idea that vaccinations are being well received is incorrect and many people won't be getting them.  This will be an issue moving forward.

Another Update:

Norwegian just canceled a bunch of summer cruises.  They notified customers that they were bailing.  Norwegian is redeploying.  Some suspect that they will be operating out of non US ports now.  Carnival president has already stated they are not leaving US ports.  So if Norwegian is leaving because they believe summer sailing from the US is a no go then Carnival is screwed.

mev588,,stocks,post,1616908639,"PFSI is way more undervalued than UWMC and other pureplay mortgage competitors**First, a summary:**

PFSI is significantly undervalued when comparing to competitors. They have a 1.04 P/S, 1.38 P/B, 10% of cap in cash, buying back 15% of float. If you think UWMC is undervalued then you'll love PFSI, and I think PFSI is undervalued by at least 50% compared to other pureplay mortgage companies.

I tried to post this in WSB but of course the apes don't actually read the post and just downvotes since they are down in UWMC. Wanted to see if the more rational investors here have any thoughts and comments.

***Just a note: UWMC and RKT still have good potential for short term speculative plays since their short interests are high. This post is only talking about mid to long term valuations among large traditional mortgage companies. I think the valuations of RKT, TREE, LDI, etc are different since they have a different business model with online lending.***

**Introduction:**

With the recent feud between RKT and UWMC, I decided to take a closer look at a few other companies in the mortgage sector. I was surprised to find that PFSI was at such a low valuation compared to competitors. PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI) is a company that does mortgage origination and investment management services. They were founded in 2008 at the heels of the mortgage financial crisis and they are based in Westlake Village, CA. Currently, they are the 3rd largest mortgage lender. They operate in both the direct-to-consumer channel and the broker channel.

**Financials:**

PFSI has a market cap of $4.73B on sales of $4.56B, and a net income of $1.65B in 2020. They also have $3.4B of equity, including $500m cash, at the end of 2020 (see their [10-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001745916/ef9f38e8-9bdd-48a2-9a09-3cc22e4832ac.pdf)). This means that if they make $1.3B profit in 2021, it's P/B will go below 1 for the current stock price. Book values for mortgage companies are generally pretty accurate because there aren't a lot of physical assets that are difficult to value. $1.3B is a 21% downside to their 2021 earning numbers, and I think it will be pretty likely they make this much since the housing market is still hot. The consensus EPS forecast for 2021 is $19/share, and with 71.77m shares outstanding, that would already be $1.36B earnings. Usually for sectors like mortgage, the outlook and forecast are pretty conservative as well.

**Stock buyback:**

PFSI recently approved an increase of their buyback program from $500m to $1B, $350m of which is already used before end of 2020. This means that they are going to buy back another \~15% of the company at current valuations.

**Comparison to competitors:**

*P/E:*

PFSI (3.09); UWMC (n/a); WD (13.6); ESN (11.45); COOP (11.27); HTGC (8.01)

*Forward (P/E):*

PFSI (5.45); UWMC (6.15); WD (11.82); ESNT (7.39); COOP (6.93); HTGC (11.34)

*P/S:*

PFSI (1.04); UWMC (3.59); WD (3.21); ESNT (5.35); COOP (1.1); HTGC (6.47)

*P/B:*

PFSI (1.38); UWMC (2.6\*); WD (2.68); ESNT (1.29); COOP (1.25); HTGC (1.42)

\*using equity numbers from UWMC's 10-K, the public numbers are wrong because of UWMC IPOed with a merger.

Here I've only compared a few larger cap traditional mortgage companies. I excluded companies like RKT, LDI, TREE, etc because they have different business models with online lending and I think their valuations cannot be compared with these traditional mortgage companies.

**Risks of housing market downturn:**

The major headwind to mortgage companies right now is the prospect of rising interest rates and a housing market downturn. However, we know that JPow said the Fed interest won't move until at least after 2023. The mortgage interest rate may creep up a bit but won't go up wildly for next few years. This means that the risk to mortgage companies is not substantial. The lower EPS is already included in the forecast. Furthermore, these few biggest mortgage companies are still gaining market share from the big banks in the mortgage sector, and I would expect this to offset the loss in overall business somewhat.

Positions: bought 150 PFSI shares to start. I'm also holding RKT shares and leaps for its growth potential and squeeze potential (see my past DDs on RKT: [RKT's Road to S&P 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m835pq/rkts_road_to_sp500/), [why RKT is not a mortgage company with an app](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/), [Catalyst for continued housing boom this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8tg5w/rkt_catalysts_for_continued_housing_boom_this_year/), [RKT's growth story shows up in its financials](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/))",['SPGI']

[Porsche to produce fuel 'as clean' as electric vehicles](https://www.dw.com/en/porsche-to-produce-fuel-as-clean-as-electric-vehicles/a-56787413)

> Enter electrofuels or eFuels as Porsche calls it — synthetic methanol gasoline that will be produced using green hydrogen, made with renewable energy. The fuel will burn the same as gasoline made from crude oil but without the huge greenhouse gas emissions. It can be sold at the existing network of filling stations globally and Porsche owners won't need to get their engines modified.

> Porsche spokesman Peter Gräve told DW its eFuels will ""permit the almost climate-neutral operation of combustion-engine vehicles."" The carmaker recently said its electrofuels could cut CO2 emissions by more than 85% and is cleaner than an electric vehicle when factoring in the environmental impact of battery production.

While the article discusses Porsche out of all Volkswagen brands, the applicability of this synthetic fuel initiative extends to all the other brands.

Even by 2030, there will still be markets where switching to EVs is not feasible, most notably emerging markets whose electrical infrastructure can be easily knocked out by typhoons.

Synthetic fuel could be Volkwagen's ace up its sleeve against the likes of Toyota and Suzuki, or it could just be the next Dieselgate.

meurie,gsk9262,stocks,comment,1616917898,"Yeah this is very interesting, but seems also an awfully long shot.

A few things to think over:

Price remains a concern.

Distribution also. It needs to be adopted by the whole industry or it won’t make it to your fuel station.

Green fuels won’t stop the move to EVs. Electric is just better to drive, easier to care, doesn’t smell and choke you when you are in a trafficked road or big city.

Let’s not forget we already have a kind-of environmental friendly and inexpensive alternative fuel: LPG.
I have a dual fuel LPG car. With it I can go in the city center on days of traffic closure, and at a rough calculation it’s about as expensive to run as EV charged on a public fast chargers. No range anxiety, and the car itself is much cheaper than a EV.
You can also convert many existing cars to use it. Yet you don’t see anyone care much about.

In fact, it probably gets willfully ignored to make the case for EV look more compelling. EV savings on pollution and fuel are shown against petrol and diesel, rather than the better option, LPG.

So eFuels, assuming they see adoption, may become just an option to keep certain old cars usable for longer. Specifically, sport and historic cars, which are unfeasible to convert to LPG because of the need of an additional fuel tank goes against the spirit of preservation. That’s not a huge business.

For most everyone else, the eFuel option exists and is available already, it’s called LPG, and the masses already don’t care because it’s not new and shiny anymore.",
meurie,gske0dg,stocks,comment,1616922726,"I work in public policy in Germany where the debate on electric mobility vs. hydrogen mobility vs. synthetic fuels has been settled for a while now. the long story short is, electric mobility, due to simple physics, has the highest overall energy efficiency, from your solar panels or wind turbines to your wheel. hydrogen is distant second, synthetic fuels are dead last. in fact, you need 4 to 5 times more solar and wind power for the same number of kilometres driven for hydrogen than for direct electric drive. that translates into 4 to 5 times the capex for power production alone, plus capex for the extra conversion step from power to hydrogen (ever heard that electrolysers being expensive? well ...). for synthetic fuels you need *even more* clean power and *another extra* conversion step. no amount of subsidies will make synthetic fuels competitive with battery in our life times. all serious researchers and policy consultants have known this since before the battery prices dropped 90% in the last decade. there’s a reason Tesla is the most valuable carmaker in the world.

You know to whom synthetic fuels make sense? To the carmakers still sticking theit head in the sand and hoping the governments bail them out. although it’s probably not even an honest play at this point anymore and even they know the future is electric, but their c-suite has to make it look like they’re on top of things and earn their golden parachutes. that’s why they need to make it appear like the internal combustion engine has a future in a zero-carbon world. in Germany, you can see how busy the still-world leading carmakers are lobbying for the slowest transition and the most toothless regulations possible. with some success, too. but if the battery prices drop another 50% by 2025 and the upfront cost of an BEV is on paar with an ICE, it won’t even matter anymore. 

sure, synthetic fuels might be how (parts of) air and sea traffic are decarbonised, and renewable hydrogen will be needed in industry. but for road transport, don’t buy the carmaker’s propaganda.

Suez Canal Tanker Play

$STNG $TNK $NAT $TK $FRO

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it’ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically $STNG and $NAT, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn’t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa now. I think this could be the black swan event that kicks off a supercycle for the entire shipping industry.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in $STNG to play product tankers and $TNK to play crude.

$20 STNG 7/16 2021
$15 TNK 5/15 2021
And I have some yolo $4 NAT 4/16 calls

Edit 2:

From 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.

The supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained.",

Don’t listen to the big media platforms too much!So lately the market has been going down and people might have gotten some bloody days in their portfolios. The correction has affected tech the most as the Nasdaq is about 8% from its all time highs.

The correction has happened because of number one: Rising treasury yields and number two: Sector rotation. Reopening plays are currently the trend that big money likes and money has gone there recently. 

This doesn’t mean that tech is bad in the long term. Stocks go down sometimes and this is the moment that it’s happening. But there is a silver lining to this story...

This gives us a good opportunity get your favourite stocks at a cheaper price. Averaging down is a very delightful thing to do and this is a perfect opportunity. And even if we continue to go down, it’s ok, since you can average down even more.

Another thing that I want to say is that you shouldn’t listen to the media too much. It’s their job to create havoc and drama in the stock market. Their opinions change every week almost, and it’s kinda funny sometimes. One week they say that you shouldn’t sell and another day CNBC reporters tell us how big tech is in a bad place and you should move to industrials, travel, etc. 

You have YOUR own plan. Do your plan and don’t listen to those whose job is to dramatize things. The stock market needs patience. Investing is for the long run.

- AT&t announces they will not pay a quarterly dividend, which I would imagine would make the price plunge. 

This is all my wrinkled brain can think of. I would imagine the first reason is the biggest not to do it. But in a down market? I’d love to hear other reasons against.

No matter what a parasite real estate agents tell you - There is no way angent can add 5-6% (Their commision) value to a $1.000.000 house or not even a $500.000 house. I live in Denmark, and a normal agent fee for a $1.000.000 house would be around $10.000-$15.000 (And it’s pretty close to fixed may I add), but in the US the fee is more than 4x that, and it’s percentage based. How come? There is a service so somewhat new service were some good friends of ours sold their $1.300.000 house for only $3.000 in real estate commisions. They did everything for them A-Z, took pictures, marketed it, listed it online (Our own version of Zillow) and on MLS. They total cost for selling their house was around $4.500 after Lawyer fees and inspection fees. 

The service here is called Brikk - Link is in danish, so if you want proof: https://www.brikk.dk/

You don’t even need an Agent, and then the price gets knocked down to $2.000, and you just have to show around the house yourself.

in the USA, there is strong data showing that FSBO (For Sale By Owner) properties tend to sell for less than houses sold by an agent. there are many subtle elements of marking and selling a house, and a good agent can help get a better selling price. for example it's a common mistake, at least in America, that sellers believe upgrades to the property increase value dollar for dollar (they think a $10,000 kitchen remodel will add $10,000 or more in value to the sale price). in reality, these types of improvements don't add dollar for dollar value, perhaps 50 cents on the dollar, and people can lose money by spending too much on the wrong improvements. 

but to answer the question, there are American companies offering similar services to what you describe: flat-rate agents who do not charge a percentage. but I'm not aware of any companies that sell stock. house sales are regulated federally and state-by-state, so there are probably many small companies that are not listed.",

me8kb3,,stocks,post,1616827758,"5 Considerations When Picking Stocks for Long-Term GrowthLike many of you, I started actively investing a year and a half ago. The recent rotation was a rude awakening for me because it specifically impacted growth, tech, and renewables (the majority of my holdings).

I have since taken on a cautiously aggressive strategy of picking individual stocks that pass five tests. I wanted to run my theory by this group to hear your thoughts. Note, I’m not trying to find deep value stocks or ten-baggers or anything – just solid doers that have a good chance of outperforming the market for many years to come.

**Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?**

Think of getting your driver’s license photo taken. When I most recently renewed my license, I had a huge beard, and now I’m stuck with that photo for most of my 30s. Of course you don’t need to hold a stock that long. But I think it’s a good framework for analyzing stocks, because they really should be longer term investments. Is this a company that will still be doing well in six years? Can I take myself seriously holding this for that long?

**Test 2: What’s the P/E ratio?**

Nothing new here. But it’s usually the next thing I consider. 12 to 24 great. 25 to 34 understandable. 35-49 caution. 50+ or negative, too speculative.

**Test 3: Did it already moon?**

This was an oversight with one of my original picks. The stock had been trading in the teens in 2019 and was around $100/share when I first bought it. Averaging down is no fun. If a stock mooned anytime in the last 5 years, you might have to accept you missed the ticket. Check 10, 20+ years back for older companies to gain more context.

**Test 4: How linear is its growth?**

Ideally I’d like to see a perfectly straight line over the past 5 years. Something that steadily marches upward over time with minimal volatility, and something that has gained between roughly 125-250% over the past 5 years. While I think lots of companies will do well as companies, I’m hesitant to invest in them if their history looks like a roller coaster. I especially take note of how a company did through 2018-2019, how it did before the Covid crash vs. after, and how it did these past couple months.

**Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?**

Maybe this goes without saying, but I think a company's profitability is a good indication of whether it will do well in the future. It’s nice to see the past 5 earning reports beat expectations, though 4 out of 5 isn’t bad either.

Of course, it’s hard for any stock to pass all five tests, and if I was a purist I probably wouldn’t be very diversified. Some stocks that fit closely with these criteria include UNP, GOOGL, V, HD, DG, TMO, SPGI, and TXN. (This is not financial advice.) Can you think of any others?","['DG', 'HD', 'TXN', 'GOOGL', 'TMO', 'SPGI', 'UNP']"

Anyway, here's 13 years investing responding.

> Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?

How do you even know how you'll feel about anything in six years? You've only been trading for a fourth that time.

Anyway, this isn't really on the nose. It's got some aspects, but it's not quite right.

First, not every trade has to last six years. And you should never go into something thinking you will stick out any amount of time. I'm not knocking long term holds (some of my biggest gains have been from decade long holds), but don't think every play has to be long term. If it goes sideways, exit.

Edit: man I really started talking about an onion on my belt there. Let's get back on point.

What you should be think about is ""how do I think I'll feel about this portion of my portfolio tied into this for that long"". It's really not about the stock, it's about the fact that it's tied up in something. So, you have to scale in appropriately.

> Test 2: What’s the P/E ratio?

Ok, well, what's even more important is forward P/E, and there you need to factor in risks of it not meeting that expectation as well as the chance that that's underestimated.

And P/E is not and end all be all either. I went through a phase a few years ago where I was only acquiring low P/E companies. I dropped the last of that last year because it performed terribly.

Right now, I barely know the P/E of anything I'm invested in and everything is certainly outside of my old range. If the market starts to care about P/E again, then by all means switch to this, but it's important to understand what the market really is doing.

> Test 3: Did it already moon?

This is pretty important when doing short term trades, but I've found for longer terms a recent moon isn't a big negative. A recent moon and pull back is really quite positive, but even without a pull back, a previous moon leads to more financing leads to better opportunities for the company and people accepting a higher price. In the long term, things tend to work on percents, so the fact that doubled from 50 to 100 means it needs 100 more to double again means little.

> Test 4: How linear is its growth?

To you mean how linear is the log of it's growth? Because ideally growth is exponential. Not tsla exponential but at least a good curve up.

Even then, I feel here that this is excluding great investments for lowered (perceived) risk. Plus it's trading off the chart which is something I recommend against.

> Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?

I don't like this section at all. Firstly, I believe a growth company should target zero or slightly negative profit. They should be reinvesting at a rate that they have nothing left over and they should be borrowing to do so. The fact that they can borrow to do so is a good sign. Revenue should be increasing to reflect this.

But what caught me is when you said they should constantly be beating expectations. No. This could mean they are bad at estimating or it could mean they are front loading sales and it's going to come as a surprise later dumped into a bad market condition so it doesn't look quite as much like accounting chicanery.

I like the earnings report to be pretty within expectations, and the revisions to be upward.",['TSLA']

I looked and I really only saw positive news. The NCAA tourney I assumed would be a good thing (even on a small scale). I thought NY legalizing gambling would be good news. At first it seemed books like DKNG would be shut out by NY state legislature but I'm pretty sure I read that now it seems like they're warming to the idea of letting books like DraftKings operate in the state.

I'm not experienced enough to know if this is even a good question but was it profit taking when it ran up to ~$73 earlier this month? 

So I'm not panicking. I'm not complaining my gains don't come weekly. I'm just trying to hone my research skills. Did I miss something or is this just a case of stocks being stocks?",

I've been looking at many companies and performance and have come to the upsetting conclusion that stocks don't mean anything about a company and vice versa.

Munger and Buffet famously relentlessly promote Coca-Cola as a value stock, but looking at their growth and price stability, HOW can a company be worth the same 20 years later and not increase in value?

The same goes with diversified mega-corporations like Panasonic. They make everything, but their price has FALLEN over the past 20 years.

Even titans of tech giants like IBM have been consistently dropping in value and rivaling their height at the dotcom bubble of 2001. Maybe it's their 5% dividend?

&#x200B;

On the other hand you have people like AAPL, MSFT, FB, and maybe TSLA, if you ignore their squeeze, who have hit 3-5x growth in the past 5 years.

It's feeling to me like companies that form the backbone of our civilization and produce the underlying goods and services that make it run are being dwarved by the screens you click on while shitting and playing candy crush.

&#x200B;

Does anybody understand the fundamental systems at place that are causing these ""real"" companies to die while the hot tech stocks just do cartwheels across the market? It's probably not greedy hedge funds, so what is it that's making these valuable companies lose value?","['MSFT', 'AAPL', 'KO', 'FB', 'TSLA', 'IBM']"

Lazard is a value stock and they're up 7% for me since I bought them a couple months ago (with a nice dividend on the side).

I think you're just looking at bad examples. I'm really not a fan of KO and never looked into Panasonic.

IBM is a victim of having been an industry leader and watching competitors catch up and wave on by. They haven't been an industry leader for 10 years now and they haven't seemed to notice yet. Has been company

Important when looking at value fundamentals to ask yourself. Is there a reason the company I am looking at is poorly valued right now? Sometimes, companies are ""undervalued"" because they are in a failing industry, they are a downtrending company or they've come under scrutiny.  In other words, you need to make sure a company that qualifies as a value stock by value metrics is actually undervalued and not just a bad investment.","['IBM', 'CI', 'KO']"

I don't see that this stock is falling like you said but i guess value stocks are sensitive to treasury yields like the 10y bond making market shift toward value investing and of course opposite when it falls.

So i guess the question is why go for boring value stocks when u can YOLO and go for the squeeze on GME and buy a Tesla for your wife's boyfriend tomorrow?

Moving forward, for the last few months, it's been pretty apparent that Nasdaq has been struggling to stay above 13,000 while all the other indexes have continued to rally on higher.

**Let's look at the monthly chart first:** (yellow line is the 13,000 level)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/KbOw6JrK/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KbOw6JrK/)

Since the start of 2021, Nasdaq has successfully traded above 13,000 at various points, but for January and February, it still managed to find itself under that level at the close of the candle. We've basically seen two doji candles in a row now, and the month of March is seemingly turning into another doji.

**Let's look at the weekly chart now:**

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZtrtVUm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZtrtVUm/) 

Ever since the correction began for Nasdaq, there has been a struggle in closing above 13,000 on the weekly chart. Four weeks in a row, Nasdaq traded above 13k at some point in the week, only to find itself under that level at candle close. We came really close on Friday on finally rallying through it and possibly closing above it, but we fall short at 12,966.75.

**Thesis:**

Personally, I believe that recapturing and closing above 13,000 will be the signal we are looking for that there will be strength coming back into tech. It begins with the closing of the March candle this coming week. There are only a few days left in the month, so there is an opportunity to finally break this trend by closing above. 

This coming week, if we finally close the monthly candle above 13k, and then the weekly candle also manages to close above it, I would personally say that we should begin to see a renewed rally in tech for the month of April.",['NDAQ']

mefng0,,stocks,post,1616857920,"Would like some feedback on my first ever DD. (DIS)**Disclaimer:** I am aware of the fact that Disney does not need a DD. I started investing at the beginning of this year and i want to improve my knowledge and skills. I took Disney because there is quite some information to find and I also strongly believe in the brand. I buy 1 or 2 stocks each month and invest a total of around €600 monthly, so its fair to say Disney is an important part of my portfolio.

The calculations i made were manually done, this is also because I wanted to be able to understand the calculations and the meaning of what i am looking for. (Even tho some of it are super easy to find on Yahoo Finance) If i made mistakes, I would appreciate it if you point that out.

I am aware i have still loads to learn, but the books im reading dont give me any insights of how I use the knowledge. So thats why i wanted to test and share it with you guys.

# The Walt Disney Company

Disney is the biggest entertainment company of the world. They own the biggest themeparks and also offer cruiselines, resorts and spa’s.

Disney financially took over Marvel, Pixar, Hulu, Lucasfilm, ABC, National geographic, ESPN and now have their own (growing insanely fast) Disney + streaming service.

Disney has one of the worlds biggest brand awereness and customer life time value.

# Financials

**Revenue** (2020)      $65.388 billion

**Cost of revenue**    $43.880 billion

**Gross profit**            $21.508 billion

**S*****olvency***

Common Stock Equity $88,877 / Total Assets $193,984 x100 = 45,81%

The rule of thumb indicates that between 25% and 50% solvency, the company has enough own recources to pay of their debts.

***Profitability***

Net Income Common Stockholders -2,864 /Common Stock Equity 83,583 = -3,42%

Obviously this doesnt say much since the pandemic caused the loss. So i also calculated the profitability 2019:

11,054 / 88,877 x100 = **12,43%**

Meaning that for every invested dollar, they make 12 cents. **(right?)** which is, according to my knowledge, pretty good. Especially since the pandemic already started in this year.

**Earnings per share (EPS)**

TTM EPS $-2.74

2020 EPS was $-1.58, a 123.8% decline from 2019.

2019 EPS was $6.64, a 20.57% decline from 2018.

2018 EPS was $8.36, a 46.92% increase from 2017.

Now the EPS at this moment is again, affected heavily by the pandamic. So it doenst tell much yet.

**P/E RATIO**

The current P/E ratio cant be calculated due to net losses. However last year Disney was around 30 which is pricy, but not too bad. The forward PE is way higher, around 41. That sure does sound like a lot but its not that bad compared to the PE of Netflix (83.56) .

# Buyback

Disney spent $47.9 billion on share buybacks from 2009 through 2018. However it may be on pause until 2023 due the pandemic.

Personally im not a huge fan of Buybacks, but the opinion about this fact are quite diverse.

# Leadership

Before becoming CEO on February 25, 2020, Bob Chapek had a 26-year career with The Walt Disney Company, beginning in the Home Entertainment division, and rising to become the Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Before joining Disney, Bob Chapek worked for the famous Heinz Company in brand management and advertising. Chapek studied Microbiology at the Indiana University.

In the 26 years working for Disney, Bob Chapek got promoted in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015. While working as chairman of merchandise, he was in charge of the Star Wars merchandise which resulted in a succes, even though there was quite some resistance from Starwars and Disney fans.

# News

* Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland are open
* Paris Disneyland(opening April 2) and Disney's California(opening April 30) theme parks and resort hotel remain closed.
* This year, Disney+ will expand to Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets.
* **The company now expects to have 230 million-260 million Disney+ subscribers by 2024. Netflix, by comparison, has 195.15 million subscribers**.
* Analysts expect EPS to fall 5% in the current fiscal year ending in September, followed by a 154% jump in fiscal 2021, according to FactSet.
* In the last three months of 2020, as Disney laid off thousands of employees, its shares surged 46%.
* DIS stock hit an all-time high of 203.02 on March 8(2021)
* Walt Disney along with ESPN, have reached an immersive, multi-year media rights agreement for exclusive live UFC content on ESPN+
* Disney had a huge dip in March 2020, being the cheapest since 2014. Part of this was because of COVID, negative revenue and probably because of a new CEO, Bob Chapek.

However within a year, the stockprice increased with 130% and hit an all time high. The huge succes of Disney + being a good reason for that. Especially with series like The Mandalorian and paid movies like Mulan Disney+ will only grow.

# Stockprice

My take is that the current price of $185 is justified. Yes, it is expensive but with the parks re-opening and Disney+ creeping up to Netflix i think Disney is an obvious buy and hold for the long term.

They have a wide spread of products, have lifetime customers and i think i can defenitly say they are a MOAT. I personally think that about 20 years, Disney will have a monopoly on the entire entertainment industry.

As for now, the 4 billion loss from the past 12 months dont bother me too much since covid is the main reason. Their debt of 113 billion is high, but its not concerning since the interest is low. The solvency proves they can pay of their debts if they wanted to. Also its quite normal for companies this size to have large debts.

**I do see a lot of different numbers regarding to their debt. I took the number here:** [**https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/disney/debt-equity-ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/disney/debt-equity-ratio)

# Negatives

Disney isnt a perfect company, and are even seen as evil company by some people. Over the years they had quite some scandals, some examples:

* The new movie Mulan was filmed in XinJiang, the place where Uyghurs are being held in ‘’re-education’’ camps.
* Disney threatened to sue daycare centers because they used Disney stickers in the daycare without their permission
* Disney stopped paying dividends in 2020
* Disney told a stonemason that carving Winnie the Pooh into a child’s gravestone would violate its copyright.
* Disney asks a lot from their employees while heavily underpaying them. Allthough some employees got a raise, there are still a lot of works working their ass off while struggle to make a living.
* Their ethics are often questioned around child marketing and the insane prices the parks charging, creating parents having to save up for years for a visit.
* Reaching an ATH stockprice while being in one of the worst periods of the company could be alarming
* Over the years Disney is seen as a money hungry company that is far away from their own company branding and mission/vision.

And probably many more im overlooking.","['DIS', 'ABC', 'NFLX']"

I am just some random dude trying to bring you some helpful advice in the event of a worst case scenario.

&#x200B;

# Few Tips for what to do you do in the event of a fire sale?

&#x200B;

***A loss on a trade is only solidified when you sell***

* This may lead to the question, **How do I know when to sell?** If you have high conviction in your long term positions within your portfolio and **you still believe in them long term, Just maintain them through the fire.** Trades on stock investments only risk becoming completely worthless in the event of **Bankruptcy.** If your investment is not within reasonable risk of bankruptcy, there is a good chance it can recover. Add this to your thought process when determining if you should sell any investments.

***Only put money into the stock market that you can afford to lose***

* If your life is hanging in the balance on your portfolio then you need to pay close attention to the market more than anybody. Take time to really educate yourself using resources much better than I can provide, if you haven't already. Always maintain a big/long term view.
* If you are a bear waiting to **""time the drop""** then it would be safe to operate under the assumption there could always be lots of more volatility ahead. Some firesale deals may look very good on the surface, but should not stop you from conducting extensive research on them.

# If you deal with any investments that have even a remote possibility of a margin call, then you should be the ones on the highest alert

* Always assume the worst and constantly run estimates/calculations on your worst case scenarios
* if you are a **novice investor** and just said **""what does margin call mean exactly?""** then you should probably not be messing with these types of financial instruments in the first place. When I say these type of financial instruments I mean things like **Naked option contracts, covered calls, margin trading, and short selling etc.**

&#x200B;

mf1dbi,gsloaam,stocks,comment,1616954510,"“Only put money into the stock market that you can afford to lose”

This is misleading/inaccurate advice. 

I might tell someone this if they were buying a speculative risky stock at $200, knowing there’s a scenario in which it could go to $20 or less. Most people could not stomach that kind of loss. That’s also not really investing, it’s more like gambling. I would also give the same advice concerning options. Single stock investments can go to zero, they can decline by a large percentage and never recover. It is known. 

But if you never invest anything in the stock market because you’re afraid to “lose” it, I’ve got news. Cash is a guaranteed 1-2% loss every year you hold it. You need to take some risk with your money to achieve any kind of return. If you don’t, you will be grinding it out for a lot longer than you have to and possibly be left with not enough money to ever retire or leave to your kids. Sitting out is losing out. 

The key is taking the right risk. No, you shouldn’t invest any money you need for the bills or the mortgage, and you should have an emergency fund of at least 3 months expenses. If youre planning a big expense in the next year or two, definitely don’t put everything into the market. But beyond that, I would never consider money put in broad market index funds as money I could potentially never get back. 

Even if you had the worst timing you could have ever had in the last 20 years, and invested once in VFIAX at the absolute worst moment in 2007 before the financial crisis, you’d still have your money back within the decade (6 years later according to the chart, but actually sooner because of dividends). Meanwhile, if you had stayed invested, your money is now worth almost 3x as much.  

If you put that money under the mattress instead, your money is now worth 27% less. No joke. You lost nearly a third of your money doing jack shit. 

So let’s not go into this with the attitude “don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.” The right attitude is, don’t gamble your money away, instead, make smart, diversified investments. You won’t “lose” it if you make the smart choice. History shows that in the worst case scenario, you’d still do better over time than burying the money in the backyard.",

me2d54,,stocks,post,1616804555,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 26, 2021. (Sorry for the late post) 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

**Highlights** 

* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. 
* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan
* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the company’s largest backer.
* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.
* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.

mdorgy,,stocks,post,1616765668,"Remember, it doesn't matter how much a stock goes up, what matters is how much more it goes up than the indexI've seen a lot of comments along the lines of ""tech stocks are down, but they'll go back up, there's no reason not to buy them"" but that line of thinking is flawed. Of course tech stocks will go back up, but what's important to your returns is if you think they will rise faster than whatever index you choose to compare them too. Because if they don't, you could have just bought that index fund, had less risk, less work, and better returns. You should always be thinking about your stock purchases in the context of ""Do I think this will beat the index?"" *not* ""Do I think this will go up in the future?""

Edit: this post is not to advocate for index funds, it is to educate about how to measure stocks returns. This is stocks 101,  how well a stock has performed is measured in reference to an index, the difference in returns between the two is called Alpha.

mdorgy,gsaqov4,stocks,comment,1616770734,"This is so important to keep in mind. And I totally get what you mean when you say you’re not necessarily advocating for indexing, but are rather just reminding people of how to benchmark and analyze their gains. It’s really just opportunity cost, which far too often is unmentioned and unrecognized on here. The idea of “I never need to sell because eventually it’ll go back up” is in general wise because it keeps people from actively trading, which research shows decreases performance in the long-term, but it’s an unfortunate adage because if it takes your equities a year to bounce back, you did not necessarily benefit from keeping them, in the same way that you didn’t make the right choice to hold something that bounced back 10% when the NASDAQ is up 20%, for example. It’s also tied in with people somehow thinking a stock is inherently more likely to go up 10% if it’s recently dipped, when in reality, the likelihood that a stock that just dipped from $40 to $30 goes back to $40 is the same as the likelihood that the stock goes from $40 to $53. Both are 33% increases. 

Basically — the fact that your favorite stock dipped 20-30% does *not* mean it’s much more likely to go back up 20-40%. The market is pricing in a *lot* more information, and billions more dollars, than the average investor, and if it were as simple as “a stock that dipped is super likely to go back up even quicker than another one”, then hedge funds would just adopt that ridiculously simple strategy: investing in hot momentum stocks when they dip 25%, then selling when they “quickly recover” for a 25-35% gain. It can’t be that simple. We just want it to be because we hate realizing that yes, getting back to where you used to be after your stocks dip 25-30% means you need to make a 30-35% return.",['NDAQ']
mdorgy,gsawqtw,stocks,comment,1616773409,"And this is why I'm keeping my distance from companies that, while I think are definitely promising (like TSLA), I have little doubt are unsustainably overpriced, at least in the 5-10 year timeframe. Like, let's say for that case that you posit TSLA will beat the going rate for the S&P long-term assumed conservatively to be about 9%/yr (one could easily say it's actually 12% or higher, though), and itself give you 12% yearly return on average. That means, *ipso facto*, you expect TSLA will be priced at about $1.87 trillion (~$2000 a share assuming no splits or w/e) within 10 years. Assuming its automotive competitors grow at a similar rate (which again, would beat the market at a conservative estimate), that would make it bigger than Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, and Daimler **combined** in 10 years (remember that's assuming they're **growing too**, which the TSLA bullish side would argue should actually be the opposite, making TSLA even more massive by comparison). And I ask myself, do I think that will indeed be the case in 10 years? From the context my answer is obviously ""no,"" but you yourself should only bother to invest in it if you surely think ""yes"" (and of course my opinion is irrelevant if you forecast strongly otherwise---I can't predict the future any better than you can).

Sunday is an attempt to free the ship with the highest tide, full moon and all. After that it’s going to be a long haul. Probability of Sunday working is extremely very low. These ships have so much weight and when they run aground they suck into the earth. The physics of lifting them from being stuck is incredibly difficult and it’s not gonna happen here. 

After that failed attempt comes trying to make the ship lighter by removing containers, and deballasting fuel. If you look at the images, the ship isn’t just sitting at a pier with cranes ready to work. So setting up cranes to take off the containers is going to take time. Two weeks atleast. My very educated prediction is it is going to take three weeks minimum to release the ship from blocking the canal. 

Taking off enough containers would take 300-400 barges... that would take months to organize. 

Worst case scenario is the ship is improperly deballasted and it lists or capsizes in the canal. Then we are talking 6 months to clear the ship.

To tell you to live life and not worry so much about finances is bad advice from an internet stranger who isn’t invested in you long term.  Money is important and you need to be smart with it, but how strict you are is up to you.  

My strategy.  Just make sure the short, middle and long term buckets are full.

Short term bucket: have your emergency fund in cash on hand.  Some say 3-6 months.  I keep one year.  I know it’s too much but when the markets tank in a bloody dumpster fire I’m not tempted to cash out.  I have plenty of cash on hand and shrug it off.  Got that, then move to the long term bucket. 
Long bucket: automate your 401k and IRA savings so that you are maxing out tax advantages accounts for retirements.  If you start early in life you’ll be set just off of these two. Once the tax advantages accounts are done work on the middle bucket.  
When you are done paying your bills every month siphon off everything over your emergency fund amount into a brokerage account you could use/touch if you wanted/needed to.  

Once you have those three buckets flowing naturally every month just have fun in life.  You’re 21.  It’ll take time to get the full max on 401k and IrA down.  But once you’ve got that, it’s ride out life and enjoy it.  Don’t say sorry about hustling until those are set up though.  Nobody telling you to just enjoy life is gonna lend you a dime once you are retired.  Be proud of financial discipline in a world of debt.  But as many have said, just don’t talk about it.

mexutj,gskh5f5,investing,comment,1616925848,"My opinion about a bubble in the equity market. 

I'm obsessed with financial crisis. I tried to understand the causes that brought to life the speculation of 1929 and 2008 and the confidence that the public had into the markets at those times and the belief that the economic context justified such high prices on equity and low yields on fixed income.

I noticed that the speculation of 1929 and 2008 had one thing in common. It wa that the general public and Wall Street didn't believe they were speculating. People seemed to agree that the bullish market was justified and that there was absolutely no worry about a down turn on the markets. This sentiment that a down turn is unconceivable because of current economic conditions seems characteristic of bubble bursting on speculating markets.

But what I'm seeing on the public discussion about the S&P 500 and the general market is that investors are very cautious about investing in indexes because they are sceptical about the fundamental value of equity. This general scepticism makes me somewhat confident that the euphoria that characterize the historical speculative bubbles is not present in today's market environment.

meuz0x,,investing,post,1616907887,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR) DDI've spent the last few months learning about investing and the finance world and here's my due diligence on Palantir.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieh7-xYxn0B\_5d7xYB\_VfoQC4r5aT8n7B\_b6BvmKl6c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieh7-xYxn0B_5d7xYB_VfoQC4r5aT8n7B_b6BvmKl6c/edit?usp=sharing)

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

meuz0x,gsl3eg0,investing,comment,1616944813,"There is a lot of hype around this company.

Things to consider -
1) consulting is not a high margin business, think 12%. If you want a case study on what that does for valuation look no further than IBM.
2) At today's prices, you are paying for 4 years of revenue growth assuming nothing goes wrong. 
3) Their software margin really isn't that good. It's sub 70% which when you compare against Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, etc it's really underperforming. 
4) Their co founder just sold 97% of his ownership. You would not do that if you saw huge potential in share price growth.

Things I like:
1) Cyber defense funding isn't going anywhere even during a recession. 
2) I like that they are branching out to corporate to diversify their product line.
3) High barrier to entry for new competitors.

memnob,gsiebsk,investing,comment,1616880104,"Note that this portfolio is designed for Canadians.  XIC in particular is Canadian stocks, so Americans might want to allocate that to the US (and probably a bit to international, since there's already a lot of US in the portfolio), and people from other countries may want to allocate the 30% to their home country/region.

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC
* 30% VUN
* 10% AVUV
* 16% XEF
* 8% XEC
* 6% AVDV

I'm really glad you posted this, because even ignoring the factor aspect, most forecasts suggest US equities are expensive right now and call for international to outperform over the next decade.  The past decade US outperformed, but the previous decade international outperformed.  Diversification is key to consistent returns.

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['DE', 'TSLA', 'ICE']"

mf2pu6,,investing,post,1616944490,"Coursera: A DD IntroductionDisclaimer: This is my first DD, so please forgive any gaps, omissions, or mistakes. I welcome any and all (constructive) comments and criticisms. Secondly, as is obligatory, *this is not to be construed as financial advice*.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['ES', 'ED', 'WAT', 'BAC', 'SPGI', 'GS']"

mei0vc,,investing,post,1616865034,"Plugging In: The EV Transition Gains SpeedArticle from Bloomberg

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments.","['GOOGL', 'SPGI']"

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

I decided to purchase a few shares from Avantium (AVTX). 

This company is a spinoff from Shell, and their goal is to develop efficient green industrial processes to transform raw carbohydrates from “waste” sources such as wood chips into useful chemical compounds. This is a local company and I visited one of their buildings about two years ago during a university trip, and I saw that their building is modern and well-equipped. Some research groups from my university work with them and I am aware of the work that they are doing. So I have some level of understanding of the technologies that they are developing, and I can see first-hand that the investment that they put into R&D is not being wasted. 

Their current market cap is 138 million euros.  I think that this makes it a very cheap stock, and I expect to see considerable growth. My reasoning is the following:

The company is planning to build the first commercial FDCA plant. FDCA is a sugar-derived compound that can be polimerized into a bioplastic, most notable PEF, which is a leading candidate to replace PET plastics. The industrial process relies mainly on green cyclic catalytic processes. European legislation against standard plastics and in favor of green chemical processes will incentivize companies to use FDCA in the coming years.

At the moment the construction of the FDCA is still uncertain, as they have conditionally secured only 95 of the 150 million euros of funding that they need. This represents a risk, and I think that this is part of what is keeping the share value so low. I think that it is very likely that the company will secure the funding later this year, and this should cause the stock price to increase due to the lowered risk.  
I have tried to get an idea of how much this company could be worth in a few years. I think that AkzoNobel is a nice reference, as it is dutch company that develops paints and coatings and was founded in 1994. Its market cap is 18 billion euros. I also looked at companies that produce PET, and chose Eastman Chemical Company as a reference - its market cap is 15 billion.   
I think that I am not being too optimistic when I say that the market cap of Avantium could be above 2 billion euros 10 years from now. Since the current cap is 138 million, this means that on average an investment on this company would result in an average return on investment of 40% over the next 10 years.   
Putting it in these terms and looking at that 40% yearly ROI figure makes me think that I may be being far too optimistic about the growth of the company. What should I do to come up with more reasonable predictions? Am I thinking too far ahead?   
If you read this far, thanks a lot! Any feedback would be very welcome.",['EMN']

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

me5yvd,,investing,post,1616816797,"Canadian Index ETFs XIU - XIC - VCN - ZCN comparison 

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

 ETF                                                          AUM in Millions

#  Comparison volatility

Beta

 Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index – **XIU**                             0.91 

 Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp – **XIC**           0.98 

 BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp – **ZCN**                      0.98 

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

mefd3f,,investing,post,1616857044,"DD on digital health company OptimizeRx (OPRX) 

A  company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the  following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its  business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another  industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the  future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx  operates as a digital health company that provides communications  solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

I like this, I think it's a really good idea; and dealing directly with sales staff means they will pay. Companies don't always pay for quality, but they do pay for sales.

Whats their addressable market? say it takes off & becomes a staple; how much will insurance companies pay them?

My concern is Insurance companies are shitty, shitty business partners to have; when you do business with a monopoly expect to get fleeced. How hard would it be for Insurance companies to replace them with their own software development teams; realistically how much can OPRX charge before they do so?

&#x200B;

In Buffets terms; companies need a 'moat'. Nobody is going to pay OPRX **unless they have to.** How can OPRX force its customers to pay?

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['WFC', 'BLK', 'SPGI']"

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.

But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic’s scarring.

mcpqqp,,investing,post,1616645951,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['TSLA', 'NDAQ', 'AAPL', 'TWTR']"

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

>  
>The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products.

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['INTC', 'QCOM', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']"

   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence.

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.

>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'NFLX', 'NI', 'GOOGL', 'FB', 'GS', 'CRM', 'AMZN', 'IP']"

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

^(7) [^(https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)](https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

&#x200B;

In the *trial*, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the Company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal *Phase* 2/3 *trial*s by year end 2021 – one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.

""We're pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the *Stellar* *trial*, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the *Phase* 2/3 pivotal *trial*s,"" said Aniz Girach, MD, Chief Medical Officer of ProQR, ""With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated *clinical* proof of concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision. As expected, we saw benefits in both advanced and early-moderate patients in this slow progressing, debilitating eye disease, allowing us to advance this important investigational therapy for all patients with Usher syndrome and nsRP due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations. Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal *trial*s, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through *clinical* *develop*ment.""

""The safety profile and efficacy findings for QR-421a are very encouraging,"" said Robert Koenekoop, MD, MSc, PhD, FRCS(C), FARVO, a *clinical*\-scientist from the Montreal Children's Hospital and Professor of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Department of Pediatric Surgery. ""Usher syndrome and non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa due to *USH2A* exon 13 mutations are devastating retinal diseases representing a high unmet medical need, as there are no approved therapies to treat the severe vision loss associated with these diseases. Patients' biggest hope for a therapy is to stop disease progression and prevent vision loss, and these findings suggest that QR-421a has the potential to stabilize vision. I look forward to this exciting program advancing into pivotal *trial* *develop*ment."" ",

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']

They also own a variety of other ventures including Wanlimu a   luxury consumer brand as well as 30% of Secoo with which they have a strategic partnership. Recently Qudian has invested in an early learning   education company (TAM $700B), as well as nearing completion on its   business park which will be completed this year.

Yes, that’s not a typo this company has a price to asset ratio of 0.33. But now I hear you ask but what   about its earnings? In the three months to September 30 it made 87 million. Yuan? No, DOLLARS. Oh, and did I mention it has $219 million in cash?

The company has been through some tough times the last couple of years, with its regulatory   environment unstable and its earnings shrinking, that and its asset   quality decreased due to the rapid rise in delinquency rates during   COVID. I believe the company is turning the corner on this front,   however when you buy the stock you are not just buying a credit business, the CFO and CEO have stated they want to acquire companies   much in the same vein as Warren Buffet did with Berkshire Hathaway.

However   recently the CCP has stated that the next growth engine for China will not be an increase in factory capacity it will be from domestic consumption. What drives growth in an economy switching from production to consumption? Credit pure and simple. Qudian has outlasted a lot of   it’s competitors by tightening it’s lending policy, whilst this   conservative strategy has impacted it’s short term earnings it is now in   a place it in a position to capitalise on the new direction the government is taking on the economy.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['JPM', 'ADI']"

mc8nea,,investing,post,1616599768,"Fluent (FLNT) - Highly volatile + Market Psychology play 

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

\- It has been recently (17.03.2021) **downgraded from 'Outperform' to 'Market Perform'** by Barrington Research, due to the slowdown in the growth for the fourth-quarter. The management claims that their decision ""... to limit its business to higher-quality advertising traffic..."" **may result in being beneficial in the long term** ([Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/why-fluent-stock-was-slammed-on-wednesday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)). Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

**Information worth noting;**

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

Their current fair value is $415 and the sit at $350 they pay some of the highest dividends on the market as well at 3%. Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). 

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['HD', 'NDAQ']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

Canadian Pacific is buying Kansas City Southern in a ~$25B deal - ~22% premium to Friday's closeKansas City Southern ($KSU) was the last class 1 railroad after the big 6 (BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific, and Canadian National) that had not yet been acquired or taken private. There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)  
Here is the [powerpoint presentation](https://ssl.lvl3.on24.com/event/30/20/89/4/rt/1/documents/resourceList1616341384560/cpkcsannouncementdeck32110amfinal1616341383050.pdf) being shown in this conference call

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['CSX', 'NSC', 'UNP', 'KSU']"

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

I know this is a long post and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I don't really have a specific question, I would just like to hear any feedback (besides, your an idiot, and don't ever buy stocks again), advice, even similar stories.",

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

ma29dn,grsamuq,investing,comment,1616394655,"Perhaps my story can be instructive. I am 55 years old. I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above.",

That'll happen when you compare a global fund vs a US only fund and focus only on the US part of the US/ex-US cycle. I can almost certainly point to times where VTI would have been worse than IWDA.

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

m9dmdf,,investing,post,1616266670,"Financial Market PessimismFinancial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

m9i525,,investing,post,1616280238,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

* Brazil
* India
* Russia
* China

The only one that is moving forward economically with much strength is China.  Those other three have fallen out of favor for a variety of means.  About 5 years ago, we we were seeing an exchange rate of 5.6 RMB to one USD.  Recently it's transposed digits to 6.5 RMB.  The same can be said of the Russian Ruble going from 56 to one USD, and now 74 to one USD.  

When your investments are analyzed and brought back, understand the FOREX component which can inflate (or deflate) your gains.

m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",
m9adbw,grrytsx,investing,comment,1616385176,"Chinese politics aren't as one sided as folks might think.

- PBOC and other finance folks are the smart ones in the room.

- Military is filled with war mongers who don't understand economics. 

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0. US will fall back to Latin America for cheap labor, etc. 

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity. The island itself is worthless. You take Taiwan by force and you gain nothing but a small piece of land. Taiwanese will leave en masse.",

I didn't know about Ordos City the video talks about, so I googled it, turns out it's a city located in Inner Mongolia, which I know from my textbook back to high school, the extreme dry, windy weather and high latitude Plateau(ah, words might be redundant, but you got what I mean). I understand that the video might be true(as I said I didn't know the city, and I believe many Chinese don't know it either, and this is the point!), but it's biased to generalize the whole country, then talk about the economics of the whole giant China(financially, it's a complex, multi-dimensional system after all), this doesn't make sense to me, anyway, this is not the first time political motivated... But, seriously, people living in this side of the world(mainly America and Europe) should at least understand how big geographically china is, and why the northern west part of China is less developed.  Mostly, minorities live there with their own languages, majority people from southern/northern east part of China where full of mountains and rivers won't choose the live there, while all the youtubers like to take this special rare sample as prove base to show the world what China is like and will be, tbh, seeing modern houses/apartments building there is actually encouraging.

Like I said, I didn't know this city, but I do know a famous singer who is from Inner Mongolia, like many others coming to southern/Northern East of China for their career, seeking opportunities, making their stories known to everyday Chinese people like me. So we know how hard it is living there, and the government is promoting/making policies that keep encouraging us fresh graduates/investors to go there help the local economics by bringing the tourism, donation, building house, utilizing the wind resources for electricity generation and teaching/educating homeless kids/orphans there etc..  Of course their lives are getting better, and still because they are minorities, the weather is just not suitable for living  in long term, not many people would like to move to live there.

With that knowledge in mind, let's come back to the video and reviews, it just makes no sense to make any conclusions/judgments about the whole Chinese economics based on those rare less developing cities while they are improving, but people buying whatever those youtubers feed to their reviewers. I'm making this comment to pint it out, as I saw so many posts and videos use this same strategy to get the attention especially on YouTube, generating revenues for themselves, while brainwashing people who don't know about China, just keep it in mind, be open and the so called democracy is defined differently in different minds of people, although we all use the same word ""democracy""!

Please don't attack me or call me CCP bot whatever, it will hurts me, makes me sad, because I'm a legit human, I have feelings, I'm just here to provide you more information. All those hates and conspiracies are from misunderstanding, and I don't like to argue with people, always choose to be positive.",

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

m8o362,,investing,post,1616179606,"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )  

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m8o362,grjfujb,investing,comment,1616198653,"I live in Colombia and there are some key points worth knowing before entering this move:

1. **The regulation is volatile.** The government party does not support completely medicinal cannabis. President only supported it with the condition on being more strict on licenses (benefiting big producers as Clever) because his hated predecesor had a more progressive agenda on cannabis. Two years ago there were rumors about an official request looking for a reduction in our global quota. Never happened.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['PGR', 'UPS']"
m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

I'd like to remind everyone that these are not normal conditions, and cannot combat the confluence of supply-side driven inflation and the massive TGA drawdown over the next few months. 

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTREGEN](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTREGEN)

First, we still have around 800 billion in TGA left to draw down between now and the end of June. That's a bout 400 billion a month that is flooding into money markets, repo, etc. and will inevitably show up in equities. 

Second, CPI is forecast to hit 3% in May and will be companied by real economic growth as we climb out of the massive hole that was 2020. In short, the next few months will be market euphoria with the media will stirring up inflation fears and reports that government spending has gone too far. 

But by August/September we will realize it's the same economy we have have been living in since 2008. One that did not come close to a V-shaped recovery and is strictly deflationary with decelerating growth. Party will end the same way it did the last three times over the previous 3-yeas: A large correction followed by a fed bailout.",

32 years old

Wait in the market strategy, I am in it for the long run. Intent to invest as much as possible, as I am frugal for the most part.

No debt

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

I am looking for more options, perhaps 5% in Crypto currency? More single stocks like Tesla? Another index fund? I was looking at the home/landlord market, but the capital needed to get in is pretty high with the current house market, but it has a lot of gains too.

m8ugyr,,investing,post,1616197509,"GAW (Warhammer) & Cineworld Group DD# ***Disclaimer, positions and reasoning for post.***

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know. 

**Positions:**

I have a handful of shares in Cineworld Group (CWD/CNNWF) and am considering investing in both Games Workshop Group (GAW/GMWKF) and Brewdog, when it eventually IPOs.

[Games workshop annual reports and half-year results](https://investor.games-workshop.com/annual-reports-and-half-year-results/) 

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

For those who are interested in ethical investing Brewdog is a certified [B-Corp](https://www.brewdog.com/bcorp) and has a growing focus on sustainable production and distribution.

m8ugyr,grmpuy8,investing,comment,1616274792,"I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

m8ugyr,grlkrn9,investing,comment,1616255601,"Interesting, love the outside the box picks.

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

It also appears they may not be able to meet upcoming long term debt covenants. It requires Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of below 5.5x by June. To me, they’re not going to meet this.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway. 

I don’t think theatres will be able to operate back at normal capacity for years with the move to streaming platforms and lack of big blockbuster productions during the pandemic year. It’ll be a steep uphill climb ... or a drop off the cliff.",

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance.

There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too. 

Otherwise I believe its a good buy in the short term",['AMZN']
m7ptq2,,investing,post,1616070867,"Jobless claims: Another 770,000 Americans filed new unemployment claimsU.S. new weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 770,000 last week even amid a wave of abating social distancing restrictions and improving weather.

The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

   Continuing claims, week ended March 6: 4.124 million vs. 4.034 million expected and 4.144 million during the prior week

Initial unemployment claims were expected to hold below 800,000 for a fourth consecutive week. Still, initial jobless claims remain above the Great Recession-era high of 665,000 from 2009. And new claims still need to fall significantly further to return to 2019 levels, when new claims averaged just over 200,000 per week.

Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between [Visa](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE) and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?   


Supporting this idea, [Apple](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ) is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, [Facebook](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FB:NASDAQ?window=1Y) is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak.   


What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech? Will small and medium Tech and Financial stocks see any boost relative to those with massive market capitalization? Or is this all not having much of a market impact at all, and we'll see even Visa's and Apple's stocks jump back up later in the year?","['SPGI', 'FB', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ']"

Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. 

Continue...

“I’ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,” portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg. 
Senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move “highly unusual,” adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.
Another issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with “forced deleveraging,” the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don’t know “whether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.”","['VIAC', 'MS']"

mf791v,,StockMarket,post,1616957665,"Goldman sold $10.5 billion of stocks in block-trade spree Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, part of an extraordinary spree of selling that erased $35 billion from the values of bellwether stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants to U.S. media conglomerates.

The Wall Street bank sold $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. before the market opened in the U.S, according to an email to clients seen by Bloomberg News.

That move was followed by the sale of $3.9 billion of shares in ViacomCBS Inc., Discovery Inc., Farfetch Ltd., iQiyi Inc. and GSX Techedu Inc., the email said.

More of the unregistered stock offerings were said to be managed by Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter, on behalf of one or more undisclosed shareholders. Some of the trades exceeded $1 billion in individual companies, calculations based on Bloomberg data show.

Wall Street is now collectively speculating on the identity of the mysterious seller or sellers. The liquidation triggered price swings for every stock involved in the high-volume transactions, rattling traders and prompting talk that a hedge fund or family office was in trouble and being forced to sell.

Several major investment banks with ties to hedge fund Archegos Capital Management LLC liquidated holdings, contributing to the slump in share prices of ViacomCBS and Discovery, IPO Edge reported, citing people it didn’t identify. CNBC reported forced sales by Archegos were probably related to margin calls on heavily leveraged positions. Archegos is controlled by former Julian Robertson protege and Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang.

Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos’s New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn’t returned.

Price Swings

In block trades, large volumes of securities are privately negotiated between parties, usually outside of open market.

Friday’s selloff dragged companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and NetEase Inc. lower. The peers later recovered after traders said word of the offerings lessened fears that a broader trade was unfolding throughout the sector.

melmsl,,StockMarket,post,1616875959,"How to profit off the Suez CanalWhat the Suez Canal means for the Tanker market

Suez Canal Tanker Play

$STNG $TNK $NAT $TK $FRO

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it’ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically $STNG and $NAT, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn’t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa now. I think this could be the black swan event that kicks off a supercycle for the entire shipping industry.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in $STNG to play product tankers and $TNK to play crude.

$20 STNG 7/16 2021
$15 TNK 5/15 2021
And I have some yolo $4 NAT 4/16 calls

Edit: 

From 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.

The supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained.",

I thought Friday March 26th was going to be like Friday March 5th,

 instead it's going to be Monday March 29th, Monday opening dip to possibly new lows.

The weekly says it needs to happen. Do you seriously think they let the monthly chart just let go like it is right now.. no because then we have another MARCH 2020 Market crash, this is just a correction for 2021. There has never been 2 market crash in 2 consecutive years in a row, learn from the past.

So in order to not lose the monthly, the dip needs to happen on Monday then we come right back up and end at a reasonable spot for Wednesday March 31st the most important day of the month.

That dip on Monday cannot happen on Tuesday or Wednesday because it won't have enough time to bounce back up to a reasonable level for March 31st.

If the dip doesn't happen on Monday that means it will happen on Thursday April 1st or Friday April 2nd and hopefully by mid April the market starts going up for good.

If you don't stay in the market long term many years before cashing out then I do the following to give me better odds:

In general, January is the best month it goes sideways or uptrend , March is the worst month it goes sideways or downtrend.

I usually 

- Sell before Valentine's Day at the best price you can
- Buy at the best price I can get in March (usually I try to predict close to where I think the company wants to drop its stock)

- Buy end of year best price Nov-Dec
- Sell end of year best price Sept-Oct",['NOV']

This comes on the back of the news that its streaming service paramount+ will never be able to compete with Netflix and Disney plus among other streaming services. Though now at the $48 price tag one might see this as an attractive valuation with a P/E of 17 where Netflix has a P/E of 83. I think I will wait for a bit more of a decline to find an entry point but with a shift to value going on right now, it might be a good pick. One of the concerns with Netflix and Disney is the cost of producing original content in many languages and paramount+ has an advantage in that category because ViacomCBS already has a large backlog of content.","['VIAC', 'NFLX']"

metb7y,,StockMarket,post,1616901154,"Be cautious, play the catalysts, play the value ramp up and growth. play it smart.\-**Prologue ( The future is not now )**

If you have invested in **AACQ, PDAC, DMYI, GWAC, RTP, ACIC, QELL,NPA, HOL (+ several other ones, but these are the ones that are hyped up at times** ) you have to **be very cautious.**

\-->according companies : Origin Materials, LI- CYCLE, IONQ, CYPHERmining, joby, archer, possibly lilium, spacemobile, astra

\-->According Industries : battery recycling, Quantum computing, bitcoin mining, Electric aviation, global continuous mobile connection with no imput lag or connection loss, space launching.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-**Key take** ( **You have the right vision, but value matters, certainly with rising inflation in the upcoming years )**

I get it all these industries seem and are very enticing in the future, and you want to bet on the future. The stockmarket is forward looking, but value matters. **75% off the above stated companies will be tremendous winners in the future. But 90 % of these companies will fall below 10$ instantly after the merger.** why? no revenue for the years to come, and if they somehow have revenue in 2023, or 2024, they will be trading at 50-500x price to sales ratio.

**All the above stories can be the leaders in the according industries. ( 3 examples of possible winners )**

**Cypher mining ( GWAC** ) --> possibly the biggest bitcoin miner (hashrate wise ) and market leader in **2022/2023**

**Li-CYCLE ( PDAC ) -->** possibly the market leader in battery recycling, as the ev boom will ramp up towards 2030 ( numerous catalysts and deadlines for example CO2 emission cars will be banned in the uk by 2030 ), so lythium recycling will be a must in the future by **2024-2025**, pdac will likely explode ( imo)

**ARCHER (ACIC), JOBY (RTP), LYLIUM (QELL,ZNTE, i don't care who acquires them, I won't invest ) -->**

Elecrtic transportation will be the future,and these badboys will take part in this and acquire a percentage of the market share along side boeing, etc ( who is also developing electric airplanes so a lot of competition here ), the aviation industry will only start adopting the ev aviation wave by **2025-2026, if you are lucky the transition will start in 2024 ( this is stated by numerous airlines that they are not ready to transition yet )**

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*notice, from the time of writing, these companies will only start generating possible revenue by 2023,2024,2025,2026,**

this is min  2 years from now, so these are all current unicorns ( trading above 1 Billion dollars)by market cap, but without fukking revenue and once they start making revenue in 2023,2024, they will be trading at 100x500x price to sales ratio's , the real ramp ups are projected for 2025-2026 most of the time, this is 5 years from now.

**\*\*\* notice, consider countless risk factors, ( 3 examples of what can go wrong )**

\---- > **pdac,aacq**, construction of facilities--> construction delays, projections won't be met....

\----> **archer, joby**, problems with prototype models , can delay start of commercial sales....

\----> **hol**, not a fukking single rocket launched to date, prototype issues, no proven product, several risk factors

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\*\*\*intermezzo ( the tesla story ) , why catalysts matter.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

before you say, but big poppa, every fukking tech stock went on  massive tear, and went up, all stocks went up in 2020, hyperloop bull market babay , I say yes, but not like tesla, and many growth stocks wont maintain current levels, because they cant support the year over year growth in their respective sectors, Tesla will.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TESLA catalysts were ( in 2019-2020 )**

\- goal attained of  the production and delivery of  500 000 cars in 2020 ( not covid or bull market related )

\- (1 on chart) first 5 profitable quarters ( 5 consecutive ones )  started in 2019 ( not covid or bull market related

\- (2 on chart) inclusion in the snp 500 ( due to these profitable quarters ( requirement for snp inclusion ), not covid or bull market related )

**Consensus, I'm betting my left fukking nut, that tesla would have been trading at 400+ right now even without the covid crisis and the tech ramp up, because they had so many catalyst coming up starting in 2019.**

\*\*\* note if you followed tesla closely ( tracked their balance sheets, followed up on projections and goals ), you knew all these catalyst were coming up  or had a high likelyhood of being attained.

**TESLA catalyst was  (in 2012)**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nbf2mcqrop61.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=10d6897ae121835437e2fd99c7f05cd727f47334

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

as you see, tesla was hyped starting 15 years ago, but when should you have invested 2008 no, **2012,** that's when the revenue ramp up started  and the cars were adopted by the public ( proven products and proven growth by then ) and the share price exploded from 6 dollars to 40 dollars ( wowa those were the magic days, and yes these numbers were projected, so you could have anticipated on that catalyst, as you can now with the current promising companies and their projections. )

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Outro ( Don't fomo just because of your future conictions )**

**recommendation** : **Get the fukk out now, while you still can**, or explode with the bubble, **BUT,** write these fukking companies down, follow their progress, and schedule catalysts in. when will the factories be completed?; when will they start commercial sales, when will the factories start running, when will they report the first revenues, when will they launch their first fukking rocket, follow them closely, invest in them once the catalysts are ramping up after each other. From the above stated companies, you will have tesla stories in different industries ( scale up wise ), these companies have unlimited potential, but this is future potential, with no catalyst right now. use your brain and bide your time to strike.

(\*\*\* if you can't escape your fomo feaver, and you are scared these companies will explode right now ( highly unlikely ) , I recommend you start a very small starter position now, if you truly have high conviction in these plays, and you average down once the share price plummets after the mergers.

**free info and my plan** : based on revenue ramp up and investor presentations ( + variables along the way) I  will invest in the following companies by timeframe and because I have the  highest conviction in them an the value they could offer ( if they achieve earlier revenue projections and facilities are set up according to these projections and they still have the same revenue ramp up outlook.)

**NPA: end of 2023,  start of 2024**

**AACQ : end of 2024,  start of 2025**

**GWAC : end of 2022, start of 2023**

**PDAC: end of 2024, start of 2024**

**EVtols: ACIC, RTP, QELL:  2024 range**

Full disclosure! : no position in any of the spacs mentioned in this thread for all the reasons stated above and because I'm not a  sufferer of the FOMO feaver, I'm dead inside. I will 100% start a postion in some of these companies in the future for all the reasons stated above.

I usually only put money into stocks every 2 weeks (every paycheck).  Question is; since I have limited resources, would it be better for me to utilize my allotted money for a stock that lost ~%25 or a stock that is steadily increasing? 

I’m trying to get more bang for my buck.  

For example, $DKNG and $V are steadily increasing in value.  And quite frankly these are my two favorite stocks. They already make up about %40 of my portafolio.  

VS

$RIOT which I like as well but dropped a considerable amount. Would it be better to get that “on sale”?",
mekc3f,gshrwq5,StockMarket,comment,1616872731,"With RIOT in particular, if you watch it closely, it can be very predictable. It fluctuates quite a bit, 20% usually. It flows with the price of a c0in that I cannot mention on this sub. EBON is much similar and less volatile percentage wise, and follows the c0in much more closely. EBON seems to only bounce between 7.80ish and $10. 

Anyways, to the broader strategy I'm picking up on, it's almost as though you feel obligated to invest every two weeks. That is a habit that can possibly screw you. Not every payday is a good day to invest. If you are looking for stocks every two weeks to invest in, just for the sake of investing, it may come back to bite you. 

If the fundamentals are good, and DD has been done, and do you have faith that the company's stock is undervalued, then by all means, averaging down would be something to consider.

If you are scalping or day trading, none of that matters. It's only about the charts, momentum, and discipline, remember that pigs get slaughtered. 

Anyways, I know this doesn't quite answer anything, but just some things to think about.",

When I first started out I was buying in slices and putting money in every week spreading it out between the those that were starting to fly ( mostly tech stocks ). 

Now that the there is a downturn things have changed. Almost all those high flying stocks are down. 

1. I no longer invest weekly in stocks, BUT I do continue to transfer the same about to the brokerage.  When a good entry point comes I'm ready.
2. I no longer buy slices. Instead I buy multiples using a market limit.
3. I now take profits at 35%. Something I couldnt do when buying slices. 

I have a couple of stocks that are down 20%. As long as the fundamentals are the same and I expect it to go back up, I'm taking the opportunity to get in as low as possible ( using a limit order ).

In short, I started off just building my portfolio. Now I'm trying to maintain and maximize and future profits by average down on long term stocks. If I come across another high flying growth stock I'll get in and get out and take those profits to a dividend stock. 

As I grow, I'm sure my strategy will change along with whatever the current market is.

My intuition tells me that the big institutional banks are trying once again to screw retailer investors over...

* They know many of us have piled into these types of stocks in the previous months
* They are pissed at the GME 'rebellion'
* So what do they do? They cause panic selling and stop loss harvesting, by asking their friends at Bloomberg to push news about 'these companies are too overvalued', driving prices down and down
* They put some bull traps in-between to fuck us over even more
* In the meantime, the buy the dips, and when they decide that the sell-off is over...they bagged a lot of stocks with potential at a discount",
mekhr6,gsiv85f,StockMarket,comment,1616887630,"When people were pumping CCIV and I pointed out how stupid an investment it is, people responded with a disgusting level of vitriol.

But money doesn't care about hurt feelings. Even Cramer said a couple days ago, they're just pieces of paper. You're not supposed to love them or hate them. Or to paraphrase, don't get your panties in a bunch.

Of course NIO is going down, look at the way China is attacking their trade partners over criticism of human rights violations. They don't seem to understand it is impossible; literally, impossible; for them to win that sort of battle. Nobody is going to stop criticizing them over human rights violations because they got angry about the complaints. On the contrary, it deepens resolve to confront them, and widens the economic impact.

Meanwhile, the SEC is implementing rules requiring companies to follow GAAP accounting in order to remain listed on US exchanges. Does NIO follow GAAP? No. Would it be legal in China for NIO to start following GAAP? No. You can wave your hands and say, ""Oh, they'll find a workaround."" But it might not be that simple. Even if NIO continues to have success in China, and even if they have success in expanding to the US market, that doesn't guarantee that they will remain investable on American exchanges.

Tech stocks generally are not the same thing as SPACs, nor are they the same thing as US-listed foreign companies. Blithely mixing them all together under ""tech"" just prevents it from making sense.

Ok. Next. Do large traders engage in buying patterns designed to harvest your limit orders? Absolutely. Notice I didn't use the word ""manipulation?"" Because it isn't. When people post selective nonsense that they call ""DD"" about some specific stock on social media to pump the price up, that's manipulation. Trading, however, is not manipulation, and when you call it that you cause yourself brain damage; you change what connections happen in your brain when you hear the different words. In a way that harms your ability to processes financial news and information. There is no need to sound cool; it helps in no way. Hyperbole is not your friend. Believing that professional traders are your enemy is a good idea, but believing it is wrong of them to use their market power just gets in the way of your understanding the market. Nobody is trying to ""screw you over."" Nobody cares about you. They're trying to make money. Once you realize that, you'll be much better positioned to learn how to make money yourself. Stop crying about being the little guy; the stock market was not designed to enrich the little guy. It was designed for the rich to do financial combat with each other. If you're a little guy, that means you need to stay out from underfoot, and learn how to harvest the scraps. Because the reality is that there are techniques that you can use when you're small, that the big boys can't use because they'd move the prices. If you're smart enough, clever enough, and honest enough, you can beat the market by a lot, at least while you're still small.",

You'll need a direct access brokerage account. Then it is easy. You will likely have to pay commissions, you'll only be able to buy in multiples of 100 shares, and most platforms have a $25k account minimum.

What you can do, though, for example with Fidelity you can use two orders to do something similar. First you set up your trailing stop loss normally. Then you set up a multi-contingent order, where the first condition is that it is below some limit. This won't float with your trailing stop loss, so this isn't perfect. But you can update it once in awhile, so you can stay pretty close. Then the second condition is a ""day change % up"" buy order.👼",

First, I want to dive into the recent insecurities regarding Chinese tech stocks listed at U.S. stock exchanges.

I also want to address risks involved in ADRs compared to original shares.

Further some political and cultural infos and thoughts.

Then we get back to valuation and see if we are trading at a sound margin of safety at the moment and how future prospects look. Feel free to challenge my assumptions anytime and leave comments. I am happy to discuss.

I wish I could have provided more links but stupid reddit has a problem with posting myy article then.

Disclaimer: I have shares and options in the company and this analysis is no investment advice. The information is subject to change and does not guarantee completeness or accuracy and relies on other sources that are or are not professional.

**Risk of delisting of Chinese tech stocks listed at U.S. stock exchanges**

This article brought back instant insecurity because it reminded investors of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The HFCA Act became law on December 18, 2020 signed by Trump. Grandpa Biden did not turn to a softer approach like the Chinese hoped but is actually quite famous for hard-ball politics.

The SEC move comes at a bad time because it adds fuel to the fire as Chinese big tech faces regulatory threats by the Chinese government and tech stocks have been volatile due to inflation worries as well. So basically, another factor that boosts insecurity and volatility.

But back to the actual threat. Chinese companies have to comply in order to not be delisted. These are the things that I consider the most important ones:

1. Chinese companies need to comply and accept an audit of their audit papers by the PCAOB.
2. Chinese companies must disclose if one of their board members is a government/party official.
3. There is a period of three consecutive non-inspection years, meaning there is a de facto three to four years period until delisting might take place.
4. In the meantime, that issue is further subject to negotiation by the US and China in their efforts to get along together.

You can find a list of Public Companies that are Audit Clients of PCAOB-Registered Firms from Non-U.S. Jurisdictions where the PCAOB is Denied Access to Conduct Inspections, called “Public Companies that are Audit Clients of PCAOB-Registered Firms from Non-U.S. Jurisdictions where the PCAOB is Denied Access to Conduct Inspections” on the PCAOB's website.

There are 197 Chinese and 72 Hong Kong companies listed and MOMO is of course part of the list. So within the next three or four years, there are countless scenarios that might happen and I assume that actual delistings in huge amounts is a scenario with a low likelihood.

The two countries are so dependent from one another that the downside is too huge as far as my understanding goes, but I am not a politics expert, I am an investor. It is also possible that those companies will go for a secondary listing in one of the Chinese exchanges, so you might have to convert your stock or ADR/ADS and pay a transaction fee, but trading on a foreign exchange when financial markets are all connected real-time, what do I care on which stock exchange I am listed.

And within the next years, I do not see an immediate effect that would influence my investment decisions. I do however expect short term shakes in Chinese share prices that will fade over the course of a few months. Depending on media will keep on exploiting the issues.

**Are ADRs risky in the current situation?**

I read a comment in one of my posts that addressed this topic, so I took a look at that. You can read a lot about it in the F-1 amendment on the SEC/Edgar System.

Basically, you are not owner of the particular physical Class A share.

Real Class A shares are being deposited at a depositary (usually a bank or broker if I read everything right), then called American Depositary Shares. This bank/broker issues papers that grant you the right to one of those deposited, real shares – called American Depository Receipt or ADR. The ADR is listed at the stock exchange and can be traded. I do not know exactly which is the case with MOMO in general, on some exchanges it says ADR, in others it’s ADS like NASDAQ). It is nothing uncommon as they represent some of the most familiar companies in global business, including household names such as Nokia, Royal Dutch Petroleum (maker of Shell gasoline), and Unilever. (As far as I noticed, ADR and ADS are used interchangeable very often so that might be a little confusing).

The company or the depositary can cancel the ADR program, but you will get notice in advance and have time to act. You can also contact the depositary and change your ADR to real Class A shares, but I don’t know how you can trade them then, maybe over the counter.

Another risk is, when the company cancels the ADR program that they just offer you to buy out which can really suck because it might happen to a discount. But I did not a legal deep dive here what’s the case with MOMO.

I did not dive super deep into that and the bottom line to me is, yes, there are risks or inconveniences that might occur and those may result in fees and price fluctuations that you need to stomach. To myself, I do not see an immediate risk here, but it might happen, and you might want to prepare for that, at least do some research on how this worst-case scenario works and what you might have to do.

I have contacted the IR of MOMO Inc. and try to find out the current depositary, it was Deutsche Bank in 2014.

It is a common practice for many major companies, so to me it’s like reading the side effects of prescription drugs. You want to know what might happen and who you need to call when it happens. In the meantime, take as prescribed.

**Political and cultural factors**

MOMO Inc.’s Tantan app was banned from app stores due to accusations of promoting prostitution etc. So, you see the government interferes when something doesn’t run according to their plans or view of the world. But that is also a chance here, which I want to explain in a bit.

Also, Chinese culture is still pretty conservative and usually your parents or grandparents suggested your spouse or wanted you to get married soon, whatever. I have read some articles on that, but that’s old-fashioned and the MOMO products are addressed to the younger generation.

And also, the party will most likely adapt to the modern views, because they have to and they will want to.

And here are the chances for MOMO.

1. They have cleaned up their user ecosystem and the ban was in 2019. They have the worst behind them here and are ready to move forward being compliant with the government’s view.
2. As stated in my previous article, Also the government might have an incentive to support dating, since birthrates in the republic are down massively. The 2019 figure marked the lowest point since the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949.
3. Chinese government is focusing on the soon-to-be monopolies like Alibaba, JD.com, Tencent etc. MOMO is a dwarf compared to them. They have data, yes, but they are not a threat to the government regarding money, credit, sales monopolies, pricing power etc. Saying that, wait until Amazon controls prices, goods, delivery logistics etc. Government will step in as well and then what. Chinese government is just stepping in earlier.
4. The Q4 earnings transcript describes the long-term view of the founders and their reactions towards the coming years strategy and product wise. “\[…\] Many of you would agree with me that the coming 10 years we'll see continuous boom of China's private consumption and it will be gearing up from a goods driven mode toward a service and new consumption driven model. \[…\] During the past couple of years, we have consistently observed a key trend that young people in China are demonstrating strong willingness and rising consumption power to pay for dating services. I believe that such trend is going to continue or even accelerate in the coming decade. \[…\] Long-term wise the best way to take advantage of such secondary trend is certainly to supplement the subscription base model with a good non-sub base value added service mechanism. This is indeed one of our key priorities in the coming few years. \[…\] But actually in the coming 3 to 5 years, Tantan should actually have bigger potential -- bigger revenue potential in the form of VAS than Momo has today.”
5. The use of the Tantan/Tinder system is highly addictive. If you have friends or used the app yourself, you will know. There’s also a study that proves it.

Of course, you can never be 100% sure Chinese government doesn’t interfere out of nowhere, but I think that avoiding monopolies and take steps to keep platforms clean of prostitution are kind of good steps actually.

**Further valuation**

Last week was hard to stomach, earnings surprise of over 40%, MAU decline despite COVID effects in the harsh Chinese lockdown were lower than expected, dividend announcement, more cash on hands than end of 2019…and the price drops sharply. So, I wanted to see if the recent downgrades and upgrades represent fair levels of valuation. I do not know what factors they include in their modelling, but I kind of can figure out what they leave out or what the assumptions are and that I want to share with you.

As I stated in a short article yesterday, on what real multiple/ration the stock is trading at.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/u8yaqj539kp61.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=d48c92f71f3ba1e071cc2e674036641782a44ea3)

That is like buying out the small grocery store owner across the street. Not even because usually you take EBIT multiples, this is net income multiple. Insanely cheap…By the way, trick question: What’s BUMBLE’s net income?…ha ha ha. Right now, if you bought the whole company for the market cap of $2.8bn, half of it is just cash from left to right pocket. After not even 5 years, you got the rest back

But that multiple is just a fact and totally worthless, you need to compare it. Valuing means comparing, so I took a few other angels of view.

The first two are based on Customer Acquisition Costs and Tantan purchase price.

These are the average Customer Acquisition Costs for apps:

[Statista](https://preview.redd.it/zrdcxwq39kp61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=301aaa87e02c16d283e4579501feed4b829fec67)

If you take the non-cash premium you would pay and regard only the paying users as asset, the registered-only users would come at a discount of 66,6% at the current valuation.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/1gxrgwb49kp61.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7a1ab75e4bbd5c4a22947c1fa468a6a4b6d69d)

If you take the non-cash premium and value Tantan with the purchase price in 2018, implying the value has not changed one bit (although growing from 100m users to 360m users), you get the MOMO non-paying user for a discount of almost 71%.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/zw4gtuz49kp61.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=e47ea827aa50edd27e6ceb1d1f09c1349f772349)

Before moving to the third approach, it is important, what the above-mentioned valuations imply:

* Users are only valued at the Customer Acquisition Costs and no additional value (like profiles, user interaction, user data, etc.) are taken into account.
* No advertising value is taken into account.
* No brand value, moat or brand loyalty are taken into account, implying that you can come up just with another dating app, pay cash on the table for each user and boom they are on your app using it and paying for it.
* No further growth will ever be achieved.
* No further product development will improve the current situation.
* No further and better monetization of user base will be adopted.
* Situation stays “forever-COVID”.

And even if user numbers are faked, doubled or exaggerated and the remaining Customer Acquisition Costs are at $3.50, you still have the company at the “fair rock bottom price”.

The following approach takes valuation of other companies into consideration, our old friend BUMBLE will be the yard stick again. We take the non-cash premium again as a starting point and deduct the MOMO users as they are at full Customer Acquisition Cost. The remainder from the premium would then be the implicit virtual price you would pay for Tantan. Take the number of paying users and you get the virtual price for the paying users.

Now we do the same with BUMBLE. Since bumble has no net cash on hands, produces a net loss, the shareholders’ equity strictly consists of inflated goodwill and intangible assets. Since there is no net cash (in fact, net cash is negative), the market cap compensates a de-facto cash negative position.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/r1bizxn59kp61.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcfa5d294651226f1d34f3ff190e1a84cee60c7)

Comparing the implicit prices for paying users only, you see that the discount compared to BUMBLE is 96%...isn’t that crazy??

We also need to keep in mind further positive factors:

* MOMO is highly profitable and has strong tailwinds in the coming years.
* There is brand value und switching costs from their platforms to others.
* As MOMO states in the last earnings transcript, marketing costs have skyrocketed during 2020, so you won’t get even closely to the Customer Acquisition Costs from the past.
* In the coming years, product improvements and monetization will revive growth in the user base and the cash positions.
* The company is conducting a share buyback program, has the pockets full of cash and still $250m to spend.
* They pay dividends.
* They use the cash cow MOMO to develop Tantan and get back to huge growth.
* Remember that China keeps out foreign competition if it wants to and the Chinese has an enormous amount of people.
* The risks for investors are real, but one can prepare and long-term investors can sit out short term fluctuations.
* I consider management honest since they do not sugarcoat facts and warn investors that they need to focus on a growth turnaround and put real user growth first, numbers second.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

At the current valuation the company is valued even below asset prices from my point of view.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/jc8krhi69kp61.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7eb8b4ab61faef819de6018cd1cfb5ca0685ab)

Plus, net cash of $1.315bn (see above) values the company at historic user base cost of around $4bn. That’s a 33% margin of safety from here to liquidation price. On top you have the user data and the future business that brings cash into our pockets.

1. MOMO Inc. is at least a **digital Buffett typical cigar butt that offers a 33% upside to $19 a share from a share price of $14.50.** (Guess that’s Citie’s point of view as well)
2. MOMO Inc. is a cash machine and I assume a **fair valuation** in a range from **$25-$40 a share**.
3. MOMO Inc. is at max a strong and highly anticipated turnaround with a potential max. upside over the next years to **$70 a share** (using current BUMBLE valuation or expectation).","['DE', 'IR', 'BLL', 'NDAQ', 'AMZN']"

me2dpw,,StockMarket,post,1616804606,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 26, 2021. (Sorry for the late post)**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

**Highlights** 

* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. 
* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan
* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the company’s largest backer.
* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.
* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.

IMPLIED VOLATILITY 14,600 Call 21.19% and 14,400 Put is 17.62%

IV > HV Option OVERBOUGHT

IV < HV  OPTION OVERSOLD

Evidently, options are trading at a discount at present. 

You can use historical volatility and implied volatility to calculate the probabilities of an Option expiring ""In The Money"" by April 01, 2021 expiration date.

Using historical Volatility the probabilities of
NIFTY > 14,600  is 42.4%
NIFTY < 14400  is 41.2%

NIFTY < 14550  is 53.5%
NIFTY > 14450 is  58.7%

What these probabilities are indicating that NIFTY will trade between 14,500 and 14,550 for April 1 Expiry

Now using Implied Volatility for 14,600 Call and 14,400 PUT Options:

Nifty > 14,600 is 39.8%
Nifty < 14,400 is 35.9%

Knowing that NIFTY will probably be range-bound between 14,450 and 14,550,. we can use the IRON CONDOR strategy to trade the index. The strategy can be constructed as follows:

1. Buy 14300 PE
2. Sell 14400 PE
3. Sell 14600 CE
4. Buy 14700 CE

I only really use Schwab because I trust them, they don't allow new accounts to do stupid risky things like trade options without a review of that person's finances, they have been less restrictive of buying stocks and seem to trade many which aren't supported by other platforms.  They also have really good tools for their trading accounts which provide ratings, news, charts, suggestions, comparisons between stocks (you just need to figure out how to navigate these. In addition they provide a lot of reporting around your success and failings on investments month to month/year to year which is convenient. You can also open a Roth IRA (tax advantaged account) with them, this is generally a good idea for planning a retirement in general.

The only downside I'd say is if you do want to assume more risk right off the bat, or if you want to paper trade to teach yourself. But you could also hypothetically just open two accounts one to learn with paper trading and a Roth IRA at Schwab for actual investing (given the amount of money you mentioned a Roth IRA makes sense).

EDIT: Thought I'd add in a disclaimer that you should read about what a Roth IRA is and how it relates to retirement as that is the main draw. If you're just looking to do something like day trading it's probably not a good idea. But it makes a lot of sense assuming you're below a certain tax bracket and that your end goal is to gain wealth to use in the future. This shouldn't be used for YOLO moves or sentiment.",

First Column: Number of stocks

Second Column: Current Price of the stock

Third Column: Current total value of this stock in my portfolio. 

Fourth Column: Average price i bought the stocks

Seventh Column: Profits of the stock i didn't ""take"" yet. Its the profit from the last time i bought again the specifiv stock. For example i firstly bough Mytilineos at 7,05 at the Spring of 2020, i sold, to put my gains in the pocket, i bought again later in a dip, and etc. 

Eighth Column: Total profits i have until today in this stock (for the pieces i obtain now, it doesnt include profits that i had for more pieces i dont own now)

Now, i want to write some more things, about my choices.

1. Hellenic Telecommunication Organisation. Current price 13,58. I already have sold the stock at 14,56 and i bought again at 13,165, so now i go for a second round of profits. Good company, she increased her profits during the covid crisis, and is going to give a nice dividend (0,68 euros per share or 5% dividend yield), if someone owns its stocks at 25th June. Its going to give an extra dividend about September or October. The extra dividend is calculated around 0,40 euros per stock (extra 3% dividend yield).  Total dividend yield in current price 8%. I also expect to see the stock price at 15,50 euros until summer and then i will decide if i will sell or wait to take the dividends.
2. Mytilineos. Mytilieos is the diamond of my choices. I began my journey on Fevruary 2020, i bought some pieces at 8,5 euros per stock, then i bought the same number of stocks at March 2020 at 5,5 euros per stock and the average price was 7,05. I sold and bought again a lot of times. I had 150 pieces and i was in a need of cash so i kept only 30. I totally have gained 820 euros from Mytilineos. Mytilineos is a group of companies with activities all over the world. Its one of the most productive Aluminium companies (Aluminium prices are really high this period) in the world with very low product cost. Mytulineos also is the biggest private Energy Company in Greece both in production, wholesale and retail market. Also is one of the biggest Natural Gas Company in Greece. But its big Advantage is that Mytilineos Owns  a lot of Solar Parks in Greece, Australia, USA, UK etc. Also is one of the 10 best Solar Parks constructors all over the world. Finally Mytilineos Group owns one of the biggest greek construction company.I expect that Mytilineos will rise its revenues and profits at 2021, 2022, and 2023 and 2023 profits will be double comparing to 2020. Mytilineos current price is at 13,77 and is going to give a dividend of 0,36 euros per stock on June.  Mytilineos has strong possibilities to ender at MSCI Greece Standard Index on May rebalance, and i estimate this will increase stocks price about 10%. I expect to see Mytilineos stock price between 16-17 euros during 2021 and between 22-25 at 2022
3. Wp Carey REIT. I think you know better than me this company. WP Carey is my first try at USA's stock market, so i decided to play safe. Quarter dividend of 1,048$. I am lucky that dollar is more expensive now about 1,5% than when i bought these stocks.  I haven't decide if i will wait to take the divident or i will sell on Monday or Tuesday. I bought at 69,22 and now the price is 71,36 (3% up) plus the fact the dollar is now more expensive, my total profits is 4,5%. If the price go around 72,5 i will sell before the 31st of March that i have to own the stocks to take the dividend. I intend to buy again on first days of April, where i expect to find a price around 65 dollars per share and then sell again before dividend's xdate. 

Well i put a discussion flair, because i want your opinions about my portfolio and especially if you think that a strategy to buy after the dividend's date and sell 1-2 days before in a REIT is viable. I mean i noticed that usually the stock dips after the divident and rises before the divident, so i decided to exploit this think.",['MSCI']
medo78,gsi1hxc,StockMarket,comment,1616875711,"Your plan for WP Carey doesn't make sense to me, but maybe I am misunderstanding. What is the point of selling the stock right before the dividend date? You are correct that In theory  the stock goes down when they pay the dividend, but the difference is in accordance with how much the dividend pays out. So selling right before the dividend pays out vs holding and taking the dividend doesn't really result in much of a difference, especially considering you only have 2 shares.",

If HYG doesn’t make new highs and turns over after a brief rally, the correction in stocks is likely to continue.


Oil

Oil and services volatility has been extreme in the last week. I noted that after the initial drop this would be a difficult space to trade, but I didn’t see 5%+ daily swings coming. I do think a move higher is coming soon but following that it could struggle to make a new high so potential gains are limited. Then I expect a fall below current lows on increased selling pressure. Volatility will remain high throughout these moves so be ready for more unpredictable swings if you choose to play this space.


Silver

Silver on the edge of breakdown where buyers have shown strong support. This combination leads to quick extreme moves like the false breakdown Thursday morning. I think a bump higher from the support at 25 is likely as the dollar rally fades. If it loses steam quickly though a move under 25 in the coming weeks is still coming.


Stocks

As I’ve said before, I look for tech to lead stocks higher in the next bull phase. Having financials and travel doing well is nice, but won’t lead the broad market speculation needed to fuel this stage of the bull market. Semiconductors were up Friday, especially on the end of day spike. None of the big tech names are breaking out but if semis move I think other sectors could follow. Like oil and silver the key will be seeing if stocks can push to meaningful new highs or if this bump is a temporary buying bounce off of support that quickly fades and adds more selling pressure to the next breakdown attempt.


My plan

I remain a short term trader on In all positions until there is a more significant correction or a runaway move higher starts. This includes positions in UNG and EWJ I mentioned this week. Current bounces off support could last a few days or weeks. I expect them to be limited until recent trends are clearly broken. I’ll assume all action is sideways consolidation until we see some real breakouts and speculation like we did a couple months ago. Currently the only real sign of a change is the JNK action. There were also some strong reversals yesterday (BIDU was the biggest) which can mark a bottom. I want to see stocks like GOOG break it’s range higher to be confident in a sustainable rally. I’m taking short term profits and raising stops quickly as long as the general market risk of a breakdown exists.

Follow your plan,

mdrbd7,,StockMarket,post,1616773022,"One overlooked cause of recent stock market action - forthcoming ESG regulationsI see a lot of people wondering what the Markets will do next, but I haven’t seen a mention of one of the real root cause of recent market action.

I do NOT want this in any way, shape or form to turn into a Political Debate. But the fact is there is a new Presidential Administration in power and the differences between this administration and the last are so far beyond “night and day” that I’m not even going to attempt an accurate comparison. 

As we all know, the stock market hates uncertainty, and because this is the first year of a new administration there is more uncertainty. I expect the $DIA and $SPY to trade mostly sideways until Q4, when there should be much less uncertainty. If you want massive gains in $DIA and $SPY names, you are going to have to get your hands dirty and identify deep value. $QQQ names will naturally be more volatile given current growth multiples.

First things first, Europe has enacted severe Covid restrictions in the face of the new Corona variants. This naturally causes concern that other countries may have to follow suit, including the US. I personally think there is ZERO chance of new, severe lockdowns here, as we have higher vaccination rates than the European countries. \[[https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249). \]([https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53640249))

So, what I haven’t seen mentioned here at all is the gigantic elephant standing in EVERY corporate boardroom today: “Environmental, Sustainability and Governance” or ESG for short. Again, I do NOT wish to debate the merits of ESG. Love it or hate it, it’s here. Here is a primer: \[[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp)\]([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp))

If you regularly scan the SEC and other government websites, ESG has been well telegraphed: \[[https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf)\]([https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/potential-recommendations-of-the-esg-subcommittee-12012020.pdf)), \[[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20)\]([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-20)), \[[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42)\]([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-42)), and \[[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52)\]([https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-52)) are a few important examples.

But it’s not just the SEC that will be enacting new rules and regulations for corporations, the FTC is also gearing up because, again, there is a new sheriff in town: \[[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group)\]([https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/03/ftc-acting-chairwoman-slaughter-announces-new-rulemaking-group)).

Additionally, there is a lot of talk about new taxes on corporations and on the ultra wealthy. This causes more uncertainty and makes corporations and individuals take pause and act more slowly and cautiously. \[[https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years)\]([https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602109/president-bidens-tax-plans-for-the-next-few-years)) 

You have to remember that especially $DIA and $SPY names, large corporations are almost always slow to react and corporate Boards are hesitant to act when there is a lot of potential regulatory and tax rate uncertainty on the horizon. Interestingly, I expect $QQQ names to embrace and comply with any new ESG regulations more quickly than any $DIA and $SPY names, so look for FAANG type-companies to act first, loudly and perfectly in step with the new Administration.

TL;DR: A host of regulatory and tax changes are coming. This creates uncertainty and the stock market hates uncertainty. IMHO this is an important factor in recent stock market movements that have been overlooked on reddit.",

Info: This is an incredibly risky penny stock which won't pay off for many years assuming they somewhat magically get approval to proceed with mining from the US federal government.

* This stock has been pumped multiple times along these same murmurs that they may be able to act on the Pebble mine planning.
* Pebble has several precious metals according to tests which have occurred, so it's not necessarily tied to just finding one thing (i.e. gold, copper).
* Plans have fallen through multiple times on whether this will happen (all of the price jumps you see on charts).
* The mine was relatively famously first denied by Obama's fed, which at that time it was Biden affiliations which denied the mining. So considering Biden is currently in office, that doesn't exactly bode well. 
* Since mining has never been fully approved, a lot of the resources are still speculative, but there probably is a decent amount of precious metals to be mined there. 
* The plans keep being denied due to ecological concerns due to proximity to water resources for the local population which is why it keeps being derailed. 
* They have altered the original plans so that there would hypothetically have minimal impact on those water resources, so it's not necessarily the same proposal which was denied by the army corps of engineers. 
* It will take years for this to be set up and become profitable if approved, so it's probably not going to pop unless there's an unreasonable fervor over speculation which would only be a bubble. 
* Even if this succeeds, their stock should probably only be worth $5 a share if pebble is up and running and profitable especially considering their new proposal is scaled back.

If that’s the case, you didn’t “mess up” necessarily. But what you did do is create a taxable event. This is assuming the money is in a taxable account. 

So, when tax time comes you’ll either pay short term cap gains or long term cap gains on it. Depending on how long you’ve had it for.

Am 29 y/o, Australian and investing for some sort of retirement (in it for the loooong haul). First off, here is my portfolio, all equities, index ETFs only:

USA = 50% (US Total Market ETF)

AUS = 39% (ASX 300 ETF)

ASIA = 7.5% (S&P Asia 50 ETF)

EUROPE = 3.5% (FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index ETF)

I've tried to capture all the major global markets and have gone for separate ETFs for each of them so that I can play around with and dial in specific allocations if I want to. I'm wondering if it's worth adding more to my EU and ASIA ETFs as I'm obviously heavy in AUS/USA.

My question is - why is the standard answer to the question of allocation percentage of certain markets in a portfolio always something along the lines of ""keep it to market cap""? For example, Australia is only something like 2.5% of the global market cap so people would say have only 2.5% Aus shares in your portfolio. However, the ASX has actually performed quite well over time - shouldn't the actual attributes, performance and composition of an index factor into deciding weighting of it in your portfolio?

mdx3ac,,StockMarket,post,1616788876,"Why are analysts acting like ViacomCBS has no hope in the transition to streaming?Anyone who is bearish on this stock seems to mention the same ""issue:"" The company could face dramatic revenue decrease due to the chord cutting trend. But the fact is that ViacomCBS already has several feet in the streaming game, not to mention a HUGE wealth of content.

First some caveats. Yes, it was probably way over valued at $100. Yes, there are many streaming options available. Yes, the rollout of CBS streaming/Paramount+ has been rocky, while the free PlutoTV app can be glitchy and clunky to navigate. Also I will not be offering any technical analysis, and I really have no clue what the stock will do next after this wild spike.

But here are some reasons I like the company. Please chime in or tell me why I'm an idiot.

1. The VAST content. ""[Paramount Plus](https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/159047/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F)  features live news and sports as well as on-demand shows and movies,  including originals -- all of which lean into parent company [ViacomCBS](https://www.viacomcbs.com/)' brands, like [CBS](https://cbsallaccess.qflm.net/c/159047/175360/3065?subId1=cn-___COM_CLICK_ID___-dtp&sharedId=cnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2F), [MTV](https://www.mtv.com/), [BET](https://www.bet.com/), [Comedy Central](https://www.cc.com/), [Nickelodeon](https://www.nick.com/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.nick.com/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Nickelodeon%22%7D) and [Paramount Network](https://www.paramountnetwork.com/), plus the [Paramount Pictures](https://www.paramount.com/) movie studio."" ([https://www.cnet.com/news/paramount-plus-everything-to-know-about-cbs-all-access-replacement/](https://www.cnet.com/news/paramount-plus-everything-to-know-about-cbs-all-access-replacement/)) The CW, VH1, and rights to various live sports broadcasts are also part of the list. 
2. This media conglomerate has been producing content for a long time. If Netflix has shown us anything it's that just offering a streaming service could only work for as long as brands like Disney were willing to lease out their content. For Netflix, continued growth has relied on original content production. If Disney can create a successful streaming platform AFTER being a successful studio, it should be able to work for other companies.
3. The huge share of viewers that the company currently boasts on their cable networks is not going to magically go away when the last chord is cut. Besides Paramount+ and PlutoTV, ViacomCBS content is actually also available to chord cutters through Hulu. The companies reached an agreement earlier this year for 14 of ViacomCBS's networks to be carried on Hulu + live TV ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005157/en/ViacomCBS-Announces-Expanded-Distribution-Agreement-with-Hulu](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005157/en/ViacomCBS-Announces-Expanded-Distribution-Agreement-with-Hulu)). Much of the company's content has been available through Hulu+ for awhile, such as the Nickelodeon add on to Hulu. Unfortunately the exact stipulations of the deal have not been made public, leaving another question mark for investors as to the profitability of the multi year deal.
4. All of this is actually good news for consumers as well as the company in my opinion. While Hulu + Live reportedly starts at the suspiciously cable-like price of 64.99 per month, Paramount+ will offer commercial free yearly subs starting at $100, or just $10 a month, with cheaper subs that will include commercials, AKA revenue. Some may say that the company is competing with itself by leasing out it's valuable content, but I believe the options for consumers will keep the wealth of brands relevant. Media needs distribution, and it is wise that they aren't putting all their eggs in one basket.
5. On that note, the concept of a streaming war is pretty much a stale buzzword if you ask me. For one thing, Disney actually owns a controlling share in Hulu, over 60%, but do to the afore-mentioned deal, Disney and Hulu aren't true competitors with ViacomCBS, but actually additional distributors. Even in the hey days of cable, ""rival"" media companies were apt to cooperate in order to get their content distributed. In the world of streaming, the syndicated rerun has been replaced with something much more palatable - on demand distribution with far less commercials. But as any frustrated chord cutter knows, content is constantly jumping from platform to platform. And what do we do? Add another monthly subscription to our smart TV. The streaming market isn't over-crowded, it's GROWING.
6. PlutoTV may have some kinks to work out in the App, but I kind of love the concept to honest. It's like having some bizarre combination of cable, satellite, and internet bootleg all rolled into one, not to mention the hefty dose of nostalgia it delivers, and a bizarre yet fascinating array of content currently ranging from Duck Dynasty to I Love New York and The Nanny. Some of you will probably think I'm daft for enjoying the commercial laden app, but hey, it's totally FREE, just pay with your eyes.  And it's reach and revenue appear to be expanding: ""ViacomCBS also announced Pluto carriage deals on Sony’s PlayStation  platform and LG televisions, expanding its reach to another 100 million  potential users"" ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2020/11/06/pluto-tv-grabs-36-million-global-users-doubles-ad-revenue-amid-weaker-q3-for-viacomcbs/?sh=47eb14296c22](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2020/11/06/pluto-tv-grabs-36-million-global-users-doubles-ad-revenue-amid-weaker-q3-for-viacomcbs/?sh=47eb14296c22))
7. It has a dividend, and hey, it's curently profitable. For a long term investor like me, this sounds pretty nice. The dividend is modest enough that I'm not worried about a substantial impediment to growth. We are talking about a long established media conglomerate that's been making compelling content for long time. Undoubtedly they have ample funds allocated to research, development, and production.

So maybe there's a lot I'm missing here. I just started doing this a few years ago and I'm a long term investor with barely any technical skills. I would especially like to learn more about whether or not the recent stock offering has contributed to this melo-dramatic dip. Why would an offering pricing the shares at $85 be a catalyst for a dip below $50? Is the dip being caused by short sellers? I dream of a squeeze from the WSBets Apes... or maybe a short squeeze was already happening under the radar?

Obviously nothing I've said is financial advice.

But please can we get the discussion rolling and stop ignoring this company?

mdwe8u,,StockMarket,post,1616786962,"MOMO Inc. still priced as left for dead despite earnings beat of over 40% and upgrade to PT of $19I did a couple of posts and here is a quick calculation of the numbers and the valuation of the company is insanely low. There is no chance in the world that this valuation can stay this low for long. 

The company has 1.5 horrible years behind it, has more cash on hands than end of 2019, has remained profitable.

If you sell small and medium companies in the private sector, you have an EBIT-multiple (!!) of 5. Here you have a billion dollar cash machine and an NET INCOME (!!!!!)-multiple of not even 5. 

I have no idea how else I should describe this than a totally undervalued company that stays strong even in the toughest of times in the toughest lockdown country there is. They work on restructuring their business model back to growth and life is getting back to normal, too.

I personally do not think that USA and China will battel massively to delist stocks. It's political, but both nations have too many connections and it would only lead to trade war 2.0. After COVID you can't do that otherwise the eceonomy will just get slaughtered.

mf2t5a,,wallstreetbets,post,1616944762,"Blackberry QNX + IVY might be the next Android + Google Mobile ServicesBlackberry as a third-party software provider has the best shot at building an industry-standard vehicle software platform because they do not compete directly with the automakers. 

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform.","['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'TSLA']"

I’ve watched every panel about the future of IVY from BB Execs, and they are purposefully being vague about everything. One thing I liked a lot though was that after they announced their plan for IVY, they mentioned there was a significant number of OEM’s showed a ton of interest with one OEM asking for a workshop on how IVY is planned, prior to xmas 2020.

Considering how they dominate their market in 19/25 of the major EV producers, I think IVY could be MASSIVE. Obviously nothing is set in stone, but I really think there’s some deep fuckin value here.

**Price is not an indicator of value.**

Useful is to... perhaps recap...  the last week of price action as being something that was difficult to swallow as shares of GOEV began to approximate the cost of admission to your mom’s discount crotch circus but thank god we didn’t get that low. (By the way the quality of that spectacle really went down during her ""Groupon Phase"".)  The only consolation is that [GOEV accrued the most significant amount of short interest](https://u.teknik.io/KgmjB.png) in a small amount of time that I have ever seen.  If you can stomach the price drop and GOEV does return to the ring we are in a significantly better tactical position than we ever have been.

**So Schizo Friday started** when u/FI_not_RE posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/mdztz0/canoos_potential_partnership_with_rgbsi) about RGBSI hiring for different positions related to auto manufacturing specifically related to Canoo.  RGBSI is an engineering consulting agency which has helped manufacturers achieve goals with production lines and quality control among other things.  Looking at their website suggests they have experience in the arena that would benefit canoo to do small micro factories.

**How does the Rubber Meet the Road?**

Micro factories has been something that Tony has been harping on for ages.  /u/Planereflection of the Canoo Leak fame did some digging and found that Divergent 3D is in Torrance California and is headquartered [4 miles away.](https://u.teknik.io/JITxs.PNG)  I am sure many of the same employees frequent the same bathhouses and upvote each other’s FetLife profiles but their company is in line to deliver on the micro factory end.  /u/planereflection found [this linked in article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/philosophy-anti-gigafactory-kevin-czinger/) and also the Youtube video of Jay Leno driving their car.  It seems like their CEO and Tony would get a long and probably ran into each other at a trump rall… I mean football game.

So we took a break and /u/Basket_Fragrant discussed some of his TA, gave out some reading recommendations and weighed in on [Papa Manpreet’s views](https://twitter.com/manpreet_mba09/status/1375519164509478912?s=20) of the coming price action.  And things were pretty cool

But suddenly cn0110 busts in and says “Have you seen that Kia is dropping their EGMP reveal Tuesday?!?!!”.  **I swear to you loyal readers you have never seen such a schitzo reaction in the chat as to what followed.**  Literally worse than a thunderstorm around Arkham during the 4th of July people were pulling crazy shit out of their gluteal weeds and flinging it against the walls.   We were all getting so high on Hopium that Canoo was going to be responsible for Kia's entire EV platform and that we were going to announce IP in that vehicle and gain money per sale and that Q4 was so profitable Aquila will announce a dividend of 1000 dollars per share and strippers were going to deliver your Canoo on subscription and stick around to party.

This continued for some time until fan favorite /u/MisterInvicta booted down the door with a loop stick in one hand, weighted blanket in the other and proceeded to tard wrangled everyone to the ground with his sensible interjections of “Vehicles take years to develop Canoo and Hyundai have only been working together for a short time” and “Their electric skateboard design looks nothing like canoo’s”.  I swear it was like the orderly looked up from his newspaper at the asylum and said “God dammit not again”.

**But the real takeaway would be if Canoo would partner with Kia to build the skateboards and partner with Divergent 3d to do the custom Top Hats.**  This would be the big tiddy event.  In fact I am suspicious about the inability for people to own a “Sedan” like Canoo car this smells kind of like a “non-compete clause”.  This makes more sense than Magna which charged Fisker 6% of their company for just ONE VEHICLE and there is 0 ways that Tony would accept this and probably told Magna to get fucked so there is a pretty big hole here to fill where the manufacturing will come from.

Moreover, the partnership between Hyundai and Canoo will be under scrutiny at this earnings.  Fortunately in the updated S-1 there is a clause “""*The agreement provides for the co-development of a platform for a small segment electric vehicle for which the intellectual property developed will be jointly owned by us and Hyundai Motor Group. The agreement provides that it may be terminated for convenience by either party; however, certain provisions, including with respect to the joint-ownership of intellectual property, survive any such termination*.""  I am not sure which way this will fall but I can imagine that it is favorable to Canoo.

**So the 3/30 E-GMP reveal was dropped via news on 3/16.  This also correlates to the date that Canoo dropped its own earnings date on 3/29.  They both separately released news on the same day.  Think about that for a second.**

**Next Week we will go from Earnings to Kia E-GMP reveal to Biden Infrastructure plan which will hopefully discuss EV tax breaks especially for businesses.  We might be having a big week here guys.**

**TLDR** \- Canoo is in a partnership with hyundai/Kia to produce their E-GMP platform.  This IP basically allows a shared tech skateboard. **(not schitzo)** Kia could produce the skateboards for themselves and send the throwback trim to Canoo who utilizes micro factory tech to produce customizable Top Hats provided by Divergent 3D whose CEO said the same thing that Tony said regarding additive manufacturing techniques at scale. **(this is the Schizto Part)**  There are jobs that were recently posted to the internet by RGBSI that would fit with a micro factory approach. **(Not Schitzo)**  BB provides the sensors and software integration to the finished product. **(Not Schitzo)** Tony scheduled earnings right before Kia revealed to the world a working car that his company participated in so he can discuss it. They both dropped the news at the same time.  **(Not Schitzo)**

**None of this is priced in and when it is will make everyone rich as fuck. Then tony says they are working with Uber for subscription model or Walmart Orders for MPDV  and I get to shitpost from Jupiter.**

**P.S** \- Given the current situation with Goldman Sachs block orders there might be a sense of delayed covering of short positions.  This coupled with the futures spiking rather green on Friday and all the above mentioned news.  We could see a really good week ahead.

**P.S.S** there are some more articles being written by the great minds as we speak. I will link them here when they are up.

**Edit 1** \- Canoo Has Bantz! they just dropped a video of the truck driving on their Instagram and called it ""Coming in hot"",  Ride Bros where the flames Ride Bros? where's the flames?

metsxq,,wallstreetbets,post,1616903060,"[$BB] The size of real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['DE', 'TSLA', 'ICE']"

mf8qv7,,wallstreetbets,post,1616961958,"Let’s Talk About “Market Makers” 

Let’s Talk About “Market Makers”

Getting Straight to the point.

There are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a “Market Maker”.

However each license does not make you a market maker.

There are three different types of license holders:

\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs),

\-Floor brokers

\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)

1.) The DMMs, formerly known as “specialists,” act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.

2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.

3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE’s goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.

Example of DMM Role:

On the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.

Each of the counters is a DMM’s post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs’ posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.

Important: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.

Example of DMM Role:

Your clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM’s post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM’s post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer’s representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to “work” the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM’s post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM’s bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 × 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.

For a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM’s post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the “crowd.” In such cases, the DMM’s responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM’s post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution.","['WMT', 'NDAQ']"

mf66rc,,wallstreetbets,post,1616954591,"ASO - What Do You Think?For when you guys are done (if ever) with GME, I wanted to hear your opinion on ASO.

There is some fundamental analysis that could be discussed but I wanted to see what people thought about these points or any points I am missing for either case.

&#x200B;

In the bullish case:

\- Sports equipment: More demand in the spring to summer as people gather together more.

\- Guns and Ammo (Not to be politically spicy): ammo is scarce and they keep selling out

\- Existing Rising Revenue

\- 48% short interest on the float (compared to 44.6% on float for GME) as of March 15th

\- Lol people love to spend stimulus on hobbies

&#x200B;

In the bearish case:

\- Recent shootings could spook current investors with low sales after potential gun reform

\- Other online or retail competitors

\- Low volume can create massive price swings; may not have attention for a long time

\- Sports and leisure may not be priority with unemployment and inflation

mf5c1e,,wallstreetbets,post,1616952152,"$Root why I like this stock.$Root is a disruptive fintech in the insurance world. 

Traditional insurance uses different correlations to gauge riskiness of customers to determine pricing, with credit score being the biggest determinant but also gender, age, and make/model of the car.

$Root is using data driven telematics and proprietary pricing models to deliver fairer more accurate pricing to customers. Customers download an app on their phone and the phone tracks the user's driving behavior. Every 9 months the data collected allows $Root to reiterate their pricing models. Each reiteration will allow further cost reductions.

To highlight the effectiveness of using telematics in seasoned states with just one 9 month iteration of collecting data $ROOT was able to deliver a 15% improvement in their loss ratio. That is a substantial cost savings that will grow even further overtime with each reiteration. 

Thier IPO last year during a pandemic had some of the biggest tech names including snowflake investor Dragoneer at an IPO price of $27. 

During last year alone they were able to grow written premiums by 37%. Bigger insurance companies are increasingly adopting telematics. Right now companies like state farm use third parties to collect data and use it as an adjuvant to their traditional pricing models. Overtime though with data science using telematics is going disrupt the insurance industry pricing models. $Root in the future could offer SaaS to major insurance companies.

Bear Arguments.
Insurance is a nongrowth mature industry with big players to compete against. 
Covid-19- less people driving and nobody knows how driving behavior will be in the future with wfh.
Shorts are also not understanding the potential tech with telematics and how it could revolutionize insurance with fairer pricing and lead to SaaS to those who use driving info.


Short Squeeze Potential
Currently a lot of the shares outstanding are locked up until 4/26. 13 million float. 68-74% short interest.

Gamma Squeeze Potential.
Call Volume was over 40,000 on Friday for 4/16

Catalyst for short squeeze and potential price targets.
There is a lot of DD on here. If you type Root in the search bar and DD multiple posts come up in the past two months. Citron Research posted on Twitter Friday the potential for a short squeeze. Volume on Friday with citron posts was 3.5x the average.. This is really a wsb thing and looking at the DD on here it might be possible citron stole the idea from here. 

The insurance industry although mature is huge and Root could offer SaaS in the future to major insurance carriers. Most of the shorts probably entered at the 22 mark, the gamma ramp goes up to 40, I could see this from a short squeeze with the low float and the twitter pump going to 60+ by 4/16.

Positions: 2,000 shares 10 10c 4/16 10 7.5c 4/16 adding more tomorrow thinking 20c.

Let's review the facts. Quote from one of the articles:

*""Michael Jordan sold a stake in the Charlotte Hornets in 2019 to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim"".* 

That's it for the facts. Plotkin name. Plotkin gave Jordan some money in exchange for a stake in a sports team TWO YEARS AGO. Jordan probably doesn't even remember his face by now. Oh, and Jordan lost some money, no one knows the details because why would they know?

Is it enough to spin a story around it? No. But we'll do it anyway by implying it indirectly and by making speculative bullshit connections and by misleading headlines, like we've done every day with Beyonce's divorce for over a decade now.

2. Price increases: Pitney's Presort Services can help businesses mitigate the higher prices.
3. Shorter post office hours with some closures: Mailers can use Pitney's Send Pro Online which is the best deal for $5 a month.
4. Addition/Repurposing of processing facilities to meet package demand: With more drop off points available, Pitney can further reduce its transportation costs for ingesting parcels into the postal network.
5. Expansion of seven-day package delivery: Another reason for customers to choose USPS over other carriers which means more business for Pitney's Global Ecommerce.",

(A shallow comparison of them both.)BLUF: Both of these stocks are knee deep in the streaming wars. They both fell sharply last week due to a hedge fund liquidation. Read more about that in the link below. Over the past 5 days, DISCA fell 46%, and VIAC fell 51%. Both have a bullish sentiment, along with their pros and cons.

>[ViacomCBS, Discovery plunge due in part to forced liquidation of Archegos Capital positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html)

Below is a 3 month snapshot of both stocks, along with SPY just for comparison purposes.

[3 Month view of VIAC, DISCA, and SPY](https://preview.redd.it/8qhzft9xesp61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e655fb4a233038e41f0122327e3f763f9a3601)

Both VIAC and DISCA followed each other rather closely in terms of percentage gained. Even with the recent drop, had the stock been held, both would come out beating the market.

**Profile Overview:**

[VIAC is approx. 18&#37; larger than DISCA.](https://preview.redd.it/u0xhj70yesp61.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=5124890c20f75a651950f10fd820578eb93f8c50)

**Brands:**

[VIAC Brands](https://preview.redd.it/u38uz250fsp61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a68fe0ef84f167f1b5669b05ff34154bab14a61)

**Profitability:**

https://preview.redd.it/dmmkpgy3fsp61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a735ab5a2608ec4ba38c11429c06cd2d3e8cb47

DISCA comes out ahead here. They both have a rather decent profit margin, but DISCA has a whopping 24% advantage over VIAC.

**Momentum:**

https://preview.redd.it/lm5e6jq4fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e245da1875ed75731ddc6fed5d8a64aae9a3b25

Let's skip over the 1 month price performance, as this has been explained via the first link provided at the top.

DISCA comes out ahead in the less than 6 months, and the greater than 1 year price performance. Meanwhile, VIAC is the clear winner in the 9 month to 1 year price performance. Overall, both performed well recently, but DISCA has been consistently in the green.

**Income Statement:**

https://preview.redd.it/638r7ng5fsp61.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67ae40ae70845b7ba971bdc1c6699017eb8684d

VIAC's revenue is the clear winner here. They pull in more than double DISCA's revenue. They also come out ahead in every other faucet.

**Balance Sheet:**

https://preview.redd.it/t17gusa6fsp61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86a682e7a11bf08a3500f886aec5a323cc8c36b

Now, their balance sheets. Both have a nice chunk of cash on hand, which should give investors confidence. VIAC does hold more debt, however, they also recently announced that they are going to issue more shares, which should give them a boost of approx. $3B. DISCA, as of writing this and to my knowledge, has not released any statement concerning the issuance of more shares.

**Short Interest:**

[VIAC Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/2sdrhb27fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac8eac76c2537f90575b9a6719148d29550f919)

[VIAC Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/) \- VIAC, as of 15 March, has 18.9%, a decrease of .5% since February 26th.

[DISCA Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/) \- DISCA, as of 15 March, has 29.7%, an increase of .6% since February 26th.

Overall, both of these companies have provided growth to their investors, even after the drastically sharp decline. With the recent decline of the NASDAQ over the past month, it's a bit of a toss-up on which one will be better in the long-term (imo that is.)

**Positions:** NONE in either of these companies. However, I am looking to buy into one of these two, after the market opens tomorrow.","['DISCA', 'NDAQ', 'VIAC']"

mek9iw,,wallstreetbets,post,1616871869,"How to profit from the Suez CanalWhat the Suez Canal means for the Tanker market

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it’ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically CEO Robert Bugbee of Scorpio Tankers and Insiders of North Atlantic Tankers, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn’t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in Scorpio Tankers to play product tankers and Teekay Tankers LTD. to play crude.

Edit: I forgot to add that Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa.

Edit 2:

From 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.

The supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained.

mf3r7c,,wallstreetbets,post,1616947572,"QNX hypervisor will be in all future connected EVs (possibly including Tesla as self-driving and vehicle software becomes more regulated)Running multiple OS-es in a single vehicle is going to be a major trend forward (one for instrument clusters, one for infotainment, one for autonomous driving etc.), so hypervisors will be the most foundational software component for connected vehicles. This is why industry experts don't see connected vehicles as ""smartphones on wheels"", they see them as ""data centers on wheels"".

Blackberry's QNX hypervisor is currently the most widely-adopted virtualization platform (arguably the industry-standard) among vehicles that need to run multiple OS-es (instrument clusters: QNX,  infotainment: Automotive Grade Linux/Android Automotive/QNX/Windows Embedded Automotive/AliOS etc). 

The other commercial alternatives in the RTOS hypervisor space (OpenSynergy's COQOS, SysGO's PikeOS, Wind River's VxWorks hypervisor, Green Hills' INTEGRITY) did not find much success in the automotive industry, showing that Blackberry's QNX hypervisor indeed has some stickiness among automakers. In fact, the only 2 hypervisors that currently support VirtIO are QNX hypervisor and COQOS. VirtIO is the upcoming standard that makes the deployment of Android Automotive on vehicles easier by hosting them as virtual machines. 

In other words, if an automaker wants to use Android Automotive as their In-Vehicle Infotainment, the path of least resistance is to either use QNX hypervisors or COQOS because this way the automakers no longer have to implement the Hardware Abstraction Layer required for Android Automotive to work on bare-metal. Android Automotive will likely dominate the infotainment space due to its robust media apps development ecosystem and cross compatibility with the smartphone ecosystem. IVY will provide an interface for Android Automotive app developers to access vehicle sensor and localization data (possible monetization opportunity?). Any forward-looking automaker who wishes to compete with Tesla will definitely choose the Android Automotive + QNX hypervisor (+ Blackberry IVY possibly) stack. Recent examples include Volvo Polestar 2 and Ford. 

QNX also has the largest market share in the digital instrument clusters RTOS space currently. QNX uses a microkernel architecture so it is designed to guarantee hard real-time requirements which is essential for instrument clusters. Nobody wants to see their speedometer lags or their digital dashboard crashes in the middle of the road because this poses safety risk. QNX is ISO 26262 ASIL-D certified, the highest possible safety rating for automotive RTOS. 

AGL is no match in this space due to its monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to guarantee hard real-time requirements due to its tendency to do context switching. Some automakers may choose to use AGL/Linux for now (eg. Tesla), but this is really an unsafe practice and should hopefully be regulated soon. I remember hearing [horror](https://insideevs.com/news/342908/tesla-autopilot-software-crash-while-driving-what-you-need-to-know/) [stories](https://youtu.be/OnJ0jPGmrmM) about Tesla's dashboard crashing and blacking out when the car is still moving on Autopilot on the freeway. Hopefully, as ADAS/self-driving becomes more mainstream, traffic authorities will make ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety certification a legal requirement for all connected vehicles.

On the security side, Blackberry's integration of Cylance into QNX will also be a key differentiator. As vehicles become more connected to the internet, hacking is inevitable and security will be a major requirement for all automakers. To see how scary it can be, see this [Jeep hack](https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs) video. Blackberry has a great track record in security and its security expertise is world leading, so this is another stickiness of QNX.","['ES', 'TSLA']"

mem5h3,,wallstreetbets,post,1616877525,"My DD on the the perfect storm for Americas largest steel manufacture....CLFIf you like tendies I would strongly recommend reading.

The new 3 trillion infrastructure plan will be unveiled in Pittsburgh next week, which is music to the ears of American steel companies. Since taxpayer money is the piggy bank for this endeavor and, if you know anything about government contracting, you would know that the “Buy American Act” is serious business. It pretty much means that taxpayer money of this scale must be used to benefit reliable American industry/workers such as Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)

CLF has been on a buying frenzy these last few years, with its most notable purchase of ArcelorMittal USA and its subsidiaries in December 2020. This has allowed for CLF to cement its place as the largest vertically integrated, flat rolled steel producer in N. America. Another huge plus for all that infrastructure money coming down the pipe.

This is where Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) might just jump off the chart. As boring as steel is, it's everywhere, we need it, America is literally built on the stuff. With everyone chasing SPACs and other highflyer tech companies it's often the ones left behind that surprise us the most, and this could be that golden goose that finally gets your wife's pesky BF out of the house. After all the cyclical market is said to be the new investing landscape.

Steel is also the type of commodity where, if its supply chain or one of the underlying components (coal, iron ore, oil, labor, etc.) rises, the end result will lead to a rise in unit cost which also equals $$$ in the pocket of share holders. Further, the vertically integrated structure of the company this only helps increase profit margins.

In 2020 alone, CLF increased its work force from 2.4k to 25k according to ""Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) - Share price, News & Analysis - Simply Wall St"". This company is clearly ramping up for something big and it's definitely not bankruptcy. All signs indicate that with the right investment you could buy your very own Wendy’s, and the best part is the option prices are still low. Very low as a matter of fact.

Based on all factors considered: EBITDA, other financials, insider share purchases, FOMO sentiment, 3 trillion in infrastructure spending..... I'm going to call it that CLF trades for $26/share (minimum) by  April 17.

**Bonus Fact:** For every 1 trillion in infrastructure spending - according to a study from Georgetown University by Carnevale & Smith - 11 million jobs will be created by 2027. That's 11,000,000 x 3 = 33,000,000 jobs! Looks like us apes might see that SPY 420.69 sooner than we think.",

It is GREAT news for LPs, and pretty worrying for retail dependant MSOs like Trulieve or Curaleaf, but great news for wholesale based MSOs like Cresco or 4 Front. 

[Article about NY weed from our favorite shills, CNBC](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1262266) 

The interesting part of NY's bill is that they are implementing a TIERED system. Meaning MSOs will **NOT** be allowed to create an oligarchy like they are accustomed to and rely upon. Some companies will be grandfathered in, but even those grandfathered will come with some pretty shitty limitations on expansion. LPs entering the market later will be in a better position than grandfathered MSOs, by multiples. 

It is also interesting that New York believes that their model will be the ideal national model. That would have some massive consequences for MSOs. 

>""When this bill becomes law, New York will be poised to implement a nation-leading model for what marijuana legalization can look like.""

Considering Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is crafting his own federal marijuana bill for the Senate, there's every reason to believe we will see similarities between New York's bill and Schumer's bill. The intent here is clear, Democrats want to use the marijuana industry to create opportunities for minorities, and oligarchies do not create opportunities. MSOs are watching their precious business model crumble right before their eyes, and LPs are watching a marvelous industry open slowly with WIDE OPEN arms. A forced vertical integration is worst case scenario for LPs, but being allowed to ship their products into states like NY without having to own a retail store to do so, is the **best** case scenario. No retail commitments and very little infrastructure is the exact ""capital light model"" Curaleaf is using to tackle the EU market, and it's the same one ALL LPs will be using to enter the US. Curaleaf specifically says that their EU approach has ""tremendous financial benefits"" versus the US approach of vertical integration. 

Keep in mind companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf wouldn't be ""big"" without having the advantage of establishing oligarchies. Trulieve for example holds over 50% market share in Florida thanks to the overly restricted laws surrounding marijuana. There's absolutely no chance they will be able to hold a 50% market share in a open legal market. There's also no reason to expect they will even be successful at all once *any* competition is allowed in. They will be fighting at least 10x the amount of stores they currently compete with. They will be forced to compete via price and quality, for the first time. They are untested in both aspects. Anyone can sell weed when you're the only guy in town selling it, just ask a cartel how they sell brick weed. Lol. Your product quality doesn't matter if there's little to no competition. Also, it's not like either company has a ""secret sauce"" that makes them successful. They don't have brand loyalty like ""Cookies,"" and they haven't been proven in a competitive market like 4Front. They just sell weed in places where there's not much competition, that's it. 

Most MSO gang morons, I mean Investors, are stuck looking at the marijuana industry as it stands today. Last I checked, Investing is a **forward** looking thing. Today's marijuana Industry creates oligarchies, tomorrow's marijuana Industry creates opportunities. Companies, like Cresco or 4Front, who are wholesale focused are in the best position to take advantage of the thousands and thousands of new shelves that will opening with federal legalization. Companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf will have to reinvent their business model, and Trulieve might actually have to pay someone to create some logo artwork for them. 

Their current logo looks like a $5 package from Fiverr. Maybe upgrade to the $20 this time, Trulieve. Lmao.",['AMP']

WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED THIS WEEK ON THE CHART:  
Still confirmed to be disconnected from WSB... for now. This is good. Drastically over solid on Thursday and saw a retest of $10 USD but got rejected. As of writing this, I would have to say \~$9.00USD is the bottom and pending reversal. Using a line starting from October 30th that touches Jan 5th, March 5th and today we dipped under the trend line, recovered, and then dipped under it again. I hope this doesn't act as resistance otherwise I'm not sure how far down we'll sink. Financials come out after hours on March 30th, so we could slide a bit more until then.

\-Facebook Settlement  
\-EBIDTA Positive  
\-Revenue  
\-Debt  
All the obvious shit. I shouldn't need to remind you dinguses but with all these things in mind, this could be a very strong earnings play for those that are not in or are looking to get in. I can with strong confidence currently say all of these things will be higher than expected.

Lets now look at the chart:  
1 Hour:   
RSI - Massively oversold on Thursday, no surprise we had a dead cat bounce. I am also curious as to why everything rallied in the last 90 minutes across the market, not sure what to think here  
\-Bollinger bands - Tight af. Looking for breakout after that downtrend  
\-50 DMA - I'm sad we didn't hold above the 50 DMA but it's fine, it tried but ultimately lost. A expect a retest soon after financials.  
\-Trendline - as I stated above, closed Friday using the major trendline from October 30th as resistance. I'm not too concerned about it because of financials but we shall see what the financials bring  


4 hour:  
RSI - Almost oversold, on the low end. Lots of room to move up  
Bollinger bands - Thursday we oversold and did not respect the bands and got a bounce, otherwise again our dead cat bounce. I like this because this broke the falling knife.   


Daily:  
RSI - Healthy, below center. Has the room to move up or down.  
20 DMA and 50 DMA are completely in line with each other currently and have been since March 12th. I'm interested to see how this plays out. We're trading below both right now so eventually, this has to break.  
Bollinger Bands - Tightened up as best as it can prior to financials, expecting a breakout from the bottom. 

Not much else to report. Financials should be sexy. DYOD you idiots and do not take this as financial advice because last week I shit my pants playing Fortnite.

meg2q6,,wallstreetbets,post,1616859246,"Anyone looking at making any plays around the stuck ship in the Suez Canal?If I'm understanding the situation correctly, a ship is stuck in the canal and the congestion forces other routes to be used, increasing shipping costs and all kinds of other stuff. The argument for making a play would be whether or not the ship can be freed relatively quickly. 

They have freed the rudder as of last night, but the ship is still stuck, and the president of the company that owns the ship said they expect to have it freed by Saturday night. So it's already taken days, and they are indeed making progress, but there's no guarantee this will go as planned, and if something *does* happen, the disruption could potentially last weeks.

Just wondering if anyone else has been watching and thinking about the situation. Maybe someone has some more insight into this?

From an article a few days ago https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/middleeast/suez-canal-container-ship-intl-hnk/index.html:

> Re-floating the massive container vessel is ""technically very complicated"" and could take days, a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority told CNN.
> The official -- who spoke on condition of anonymity as he's not authorized to speak to the media -- said that the equipment to float a ship is available but it depends on how it is used.
> ""If the method is not correct it might take a week, and if it's done well it might take two days. But if it had been correct [in the first place], then the crisis could have ended yesterday,"" the pilot said.


So i get the impression that this isn't exactly going as well as it should, and it seems like there's a potential play here. Things didn't start out well and call me a cynic but I have a hard time believing leadership when they give such optimistic deadlines, so I'm leaning towards more things going wrong and this potentially disrupting things for weeks. Of course I've got to keep reading up on it and doing more DD, but I was just curious what this community was thinking about this.",

# TL;DR

The USMCA, a North America trade agreement,  was in effect as of July 2020. A railroad merger between US, Canada, and Mexico is in process as of March 2021. The legislation largely considers economic changes since 1994 to allow for greater competition and counterbalance against Eurasian influence.

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.

\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**

\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**

\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**

\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? *(You are here)*

\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*

\- Do we understand incentives vs. bias? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*

\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

\- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# The USMCA

[Cross border trade flows](https://preview.redd.it/zqk4vehrolp61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9433daaf8831146c5a2cdaaa1476660abdd0bc95)

The USMCA seeks to incentivize various sectors, with most notably, auto-manufacturing. The reason for this is clear, as the industry is orthogonal to critical supply chains in North America:

1. Cloud computing, IoT, and AI applications
2. Energy management and utilization.
3. Operational efficiency in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and logistics with automation.
4. Theoretical advancements in financials, digital-trade, cybersecurity, and cross-border trade flows.
5. Research in biological, material sustainability, and genomics.
6. Quality of life.

Considering the consequences of furthered development of the above, I would disagree with economists that believe that the USMCA is an ineffective piece of legislation. The reason being is that these advancements have a consequential compouding effect for change over time. Unlike the economists Thea M. Lee or Robert E. Scott of the Economics Policy Institute, I actually have experience as a Mexican-American laborer, rather than a perspective written inside of an ivory tower.

Improvements in cybersecurity and financials, for example, may produce changes in cannabis agriculture, which in turn would increase stability in Mexico. Ideas like these are covered more closely in my Square DD, but it rests as the basis for my disagreement. Mexico is a nation that is ripe for change in a period that strongly seeks change in the global frontier.

Mexico is clearly a nation that warrants many different opinions, as its former governments have failed in a spectacular way to contain the effects of the American drug war. In my view, it’s an issue of economic surpression, where the incentive of black-market goods is far too strong and causes a non-trivial slowdown of national progress. Trust falling amongst the working class, in a capital system, is dreadfully painful thing to experience with respect to economic growth - the clearest and most visceral being the subject of illegal immigration. A reader may be surprised to hear that Apple Pay has only been available as of 2021 and that just about half of Mexican citizens are underbanked. Put simply, NAFTA and USMCA are quite literally worlds apart in terms of progress we have been in the past 25 years.

Ultimately what this means is that the way to combat it is by overwhelming the black-market industry with strong labor participation. This is effectively agreed upon with the three nations - use Mexico as a proxy competitor to China and as a means to improve international flows like chip and labor shortages. It is also a strongly stated goal by the Biden administration, Federal Reserve, and Mexican administration; we need to achieve higher labor participation.

At the same time, America is incredibly bullish on the industrial-technological ambitions of Southwestern states like Texas. This is no coincidence, since the states are structured like an economic battleground with tariff incentives where northern Mexican States and southern US states are experiencing a strong period of trade flow synergy with energy and industrial capacities.

>“Now (railroads) is an example of changing our minds. Warren and I have hated railroads our entire life. They're capital-intensive, heavily unionized, with some make-work rules, heavily regulated and long competed with a comparative disadvantage vs. the trucking industry, which has a very efficient method of propulsion (diesel engines) and uses free public roads. Railroads have long been a terrible business and have been lousy for investors. We did finally change our minds and invested. We threw out our paradigms but did it too late. We should have done it two years ago, but we were too stupid to do it at the most ideal time. There's a German saying: Man is too soon old and too late smart. We were too late smart. We finally realized that railroads now have a huge competitive advantage with double-stacked railcars, guided by computers, moving more and more production from China, etc. They have a big advantage over truckers in huge classes of business.”  
>  
>...  
>  
>“We said railroads were no damn good. There were too many of them, they had truck competition. And we were right; it was a terrible business for about 80 years. Finally they get down to four big railroads, and it was a better business.”— Charlie Munger

The intent of the railroad is to consider these ambitions and capture the trade from end-to-end.

This comes at a time when organizations like Shopify is one of Canada’s largest financial service providers, or organizations like MercadoLibre massively distributes basic banking services to Latin America and where organizations like Tesla completely transformed multiple sectors.

It also comes during a rather revolutionarily competitive era, where vehicle technology ranging from rockets to traffic flows will produce unknown economies with respect to automation and quality of life. The fundamental equation here is to bring Mexico up to speed. Using this framework, it is clear to understand why North America is driven to produce an intercontinental railroad. Global trade, as a function of COVID and technological advancements, is experiencing a paradigm shift where cross-border flows, consequences of peace, and other societal demands will effectively never return back to normal. The merger is a representation of such a change.

- Not trying to draw attention away from GME right before take off. Pos: 200 @ $80 avg 🚀🚀 and 💎✋
- I realize that not every play or high short interest is a squeeze...

But serious question:

- Biden will be proposing an infrastructure plan next Wednesday, March 31 and there seems to be speculation that a significant portion of the 3 to 4 trillion dollar plan will be devoted to clean energy initiatives, including the electrical grid, charging stations etc. I realize this could take months if not longer to pass and the final results could be quite different but could this create some potential for companies like BLNK?

- BLNK exhibits conditions that are similar to GME in the sense that short interest is quite high (Short % of Float is 37.99% as of March 15) and the float is relatively low 30.87 M. Again, I realize it is not the same situation as GME as there may be other variables at play but just curious as to  any opinions and thoughts on this?

**How does it work:**  I use Python to stream (Reddit and Twitter API) and store tweets and comments containing mentions about stocks.  I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

**What is sentiment:**   It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

[here](http://imgur.com/gallery/vyg92Nz) is a sample of the sentiment analysis I posted when Boeing's engine failed on UAL flight.

Is it 100% accurate? No! The program misses out of nuanced sarcasm. But when you are analysing 100's of comments the issue is not very prominent enough significantly change the results!

**Is the program public:** Yes. I have shared the GitHub repo for the code (pinned post in my profile, if mods allow I will update the GitHub link here). You can use it yourselves to track the stocks you like.","['TWTR', 'BA', 'UAL']"

It was not built to deal with much ""hogging"" where the ship bends sideways into a u shape. Could snap like a twig, ergo oil spill distaster, plus huge hit on trade.

meh8z1,,wallstreetbets,post,1616862742,"Tools used to navigate the marketEveryone fell in love with RH because of their clean modern interface. They introduced millions of new investors to the market with this. They achieved this by limiting the amount of information you see. RH shows the bare minimum in part to keep their app looking clean, but also to enable rash decisions they can capitalize on.

To make educated and informed decisions one needs to gather as much info on a given stock as possible and act accordingly. RH does not enable users to do this. Rather, they have treated the market like a casino with the design of their interface. After all RH is a business and the house always wins. There is plenty of articles online that dive deep into this. 

One of the biggest problems I see is in their lines graphs. Their graphs contain no keys. They show a particular stock price over an arbitrary amount of time which gives the impression that a stock is moving  more or less then it actually is. This enables users to act from their gut rather than their mind. Think of keys on a graph as resolution. Like looking at a mountain from 10ft away versus 10 miles away. Your perspective changes based on this. Without the keys there is no resolution or context to what you are looking at. 

I love casinos as much as the next guy. If that’s your bag and you love RH casino then more power to you. You do you. However, this is not a favorable approach to navigating the market for me. As much as I also love RHs UI more than any other brokerage tool, I want to see and interpret real data to drive my decisions in the market. 

My current approached consists of using Fidelity for slinging stocks and Yahoo Finance for checking my positions. With Fidelity, I have confidence that I’m not gonna get screwed with buying and selling restrictions on stocks like $GME which keeps happening with several other brokerages regardless of who is really at fault. They also have great customer service. I have never had an issue getting a hold of them and receiving answers to my questions. Try that with RH. With Yahoo Finance, you can link all your accounts and dig into real data on your positions which trains you to look at real data and make informed decisions. 

My hope for the future is that someone can develop a clean and modern interface similar to RHs without compromise in the data department to enable users to make informed decisions. Maybe it’s out there but I’ve yet to find it. 


TLDR: I’m probably more retarded than anyone here but choose to stay away from the Carole Baskins of brokerages aka RH, so I can make retarded decisions without becoming tiger snacks.",

Since I’m already overly self-critical, I looked back, and yeah, they may have a point. So I decided to go get some receipts. After spending the night huffing paint thinner, I grabbed some receipts (citations in brackets \[ \]) and have updated my price targets. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: (at the top because I hate when you have to read the whole thing before you even realize there is one)

Bull Case : Henrik Fisker is a great car designer that had a run of bad luck, and the partnership with Magna Steyr will give him the manufacturing experience needed to complete a car.

Bull Price Target: $14.64 Based on Toyota’s market cap per car produced and Fisker’s 200,000 car production target

Bull Odds: 15%

Neutral Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but doesn’t understand engineering, manufacturing, or production of a car. His ego will push him to micromanage the design/build of the car (again) and there will be production delays, manufacturing problems, and cost overruns.

Neutral Price Target: $3.66 Based on cash on hand ($1B) assuming they can maintain current cash balance by selling cars at break even.

Neutral Odds: 55%

Bear Case: Henrik Fisker is a great car designer, but is also a narcissist and unable to take direction from people with more experience. The deal with Magna Steyr will fall apart, and they will run out of operating capital without ever delivering a full production run.

Bear Price Target: $0

Bear Odds 30%

**Combined Updated Price Target: $4.21**

&#x200B;

I know, I know, you’re sitting there chewing your evening crayons saying, “That’s pretty harsh there fib, seems like you just have it out for the guy. A car company is more than just one person. You can’t just bash the guy and call it DD.” Well, you may be right, but when there’s no car, no financials (Q4 2020 and FY 2020 results went out as a press release, but 10Q and 10K missing from SEC database), I need to rely on trust in the people running the show. Let me go through how I got to these conclusions and you can see if you agree. I’ll try to avoid too much pop psychology, but man this guy…it’ll be hard. 

&#x200B;

Buckle up, this is gonna be looooong.

&#x200B;

**Quick Background: The Early Years**

Fisker has a Degree in transportation design from the Art Center College of Design in Switzerland. Rock start vehicle designer with BMW and Aston Martin where he designed the Z8, X5, DB9, and V8 Vantage. \[1\]

Design experience, but doesn’t show any connection to vehicle dynamics, engineering, or manufacturing.

Does some work with/for Tesla back in 2007. Gets sued for allegedly only taking the job to steal confidential information to be able to start his own company – Fisker Automotive. Fisker wins in arbitration, with a finding that he did nothing wrong. \[1\] I mention this not to throw shade (he won the arbitration after all), just to introduce his connection to Elon Musk and Tesla. This connection seems an unavoidable thread through his work at Fisker Automotive which would have directly competed with Tesla.

**Chapter 1: Fisker Automotive (the first one)**

Henrik Fisker created his first car company. Named it after himself (not a glaring red flag since it’s his first company, but remember this for later). Created a car – the Fisker Karma – that was beautiful, but an engineering disaster. 

The most publicized issue was batteries that would catch on fire. But this wasn’t the only problem. “Pressure on engineers to stay faithful to Henrik Fisker’s original design, even when flaws emerged that undercut the Karma’s performance and potential fixes would add millions in cost.” \[2\]. These flaws included an exhaust system for the hybrid ICE that pointed forwards. The Exhaust. Pointed. Forward. And Fisker wouldn’t let anyone change it.

“On more than one occasion, Fisker asked suppliers to hand-build certain components for the Karma, which increased the cost as much as threefold” \[2\]

“The company churned through three battery suppliers in three years. As PrivCo notes in this amazing timeline, Fisker established a pattern of awarding supply contracts ‘not necessarily to the best supplier, or the supplier who offers the best price…but rather to companies that were owners and investors in Fisker.’” \[3\]

“As the years rolled by, Fisker observers became increasingly suspicious that the company didn’t even possess a working car. At the 2008 debut, Fisker announced that the Karma would go on sale in late 2009. Yet by early 2010, when Bill Gifford profiled the company for Popular Science, no one but the chauffeur for the Crown Prince of Denmark had driven even an early prototype.” \[3\]

“’Beneath the world-class skin was a rudimentary machine that needed several years of engineering refinement and testing before it could be ready to be released,’ said Maurice Gunderson, a managing partner at Runway Capital Partners who had an opportunity to invest in Fisker in early 2010 and passed.” \[2\]

“From 2008 to 2012, the carmaker lost an estimated $1 billion.” \[2\] (currently FSR claims $991m cash on hand and a planned production start at the end of 2023). 

This was heavily scrutinized after the fact since they had taken a $529M loan from the US Department of Energy and faced a congressional hearing in 2013. He left the company, and it soon after closed up shop and was liquidated and bought by a Chinese company. The same company that made the batteries for the Karma, that were catching fire. That’s got to hurt.

So, man that’s a rough start. Maybe he learned a bunch of lessons (best lessons are learned by making mistakes you know). Maybe he came back stronger, smarter, and better. Let’s see…

**Interlude: VLF Force 1 (2016)**

His next related venture after getting out of Fisker Automotive was a collaboration with some buddies to make a bespoke supercar called the VLF Force 1. His buddies had a company, VL Automotive, and they were like, wouldn’t it be cool if you \[Fisker\] could design a car for us. Fisker was like cool, since were friends and all. You might notice the difference between the name of the company and the name of the car. VL…VLF…VL…VLF. Yes, he made them change the name to add the “F” for Fisker before he agreed to help (two is a pattern). \[4\]

As promotion for this, he gave an interview where he answered a couple questions about the downfall of Fisker Automotive. \[4\]

Q: So what really happened at the end of Fisker Automotive?

A: I had major disagreements with the management on strategy, and I resigned in March 2013. Shortly after, the company eventually filed for voluntary bankruptcy in November 2013.

Q: You were the Chairman not the CEO then. How was the decision made to wind up the company?

A: After I left, Fisker Automotive went on for a few months. They filed for voluntary bankruptcy and restructuring in November 2013. In February 2014, a judge carried out a public and structured auction of the assets of Fisker Automotive, the winners being a large parts supplier in China called Wanxiang.

It’s a short back and forth, but there’s a lot in there to unpack. I just don’t have the time or the psychology degree to piece through it. Suffice to say, it really doesn’t sound to me like a man who learned any lessons or is taking any responsibility for the failure. 

Also relating to the VLF Force 1 is the first mention of him taking control of design and production of the battery systems. 

“We have formed a joint venture with Nanotech to create Fisker Nanotech that is developing a ground-breaking battery where we are testing the use of Graphene along with Lithium ion. It is showing some amazing possibilities. It will have, for sure, the world’s longest range. We have a good chance of passing 400 miles \[on a single charge\]. Plus we can charge it much faster and it has a longer life.” \[4\]. 

Wait, 400 mile range! In 2016! This should have been groundbreaking. But alas, it was vaporware. 

He also shows his deep lack of understanding of car manufacturing and design in the same interview. After owning a car company for four years.

“We also ended up changing the rear end, to accommodate the exhaust pipes. And, of course, we had to put the driveshaft down through the centre. In the beginning I think everybody thought that’s pretty easy. But it ended up taking several years and millions of dollars.” \[4\]

He also mentions a second car, the VLF Destino, that would be a high volume, low cost car. However this is the first of what I’ll refer to his “vaporcars”. 

**Chapter 3: Return of the Fisker (Inc.)** 

Fisker eventually got the rights to his name back and started a third company named after himself, Fisker Inc. We’re going to go through a lot here, but pay attention to dates. 

In 2017 Fisker unveils the Fisker Emotion (this will become vaporcar 2). Claimed modest specs like a 400 mile range \[5\], Level 4 autonomous drive \[6\], and a solid state battery \[6\]. Said that production would start in 2020 \[6\]. Again, any single one of these specs coming out in a car released TODAY would be game changing. But he claimed to have them ready to go in 2017. 

So lets talk about that battery. A solid state battery is the holy grail right now for car manufacturers. Read up on $QS if you want more details, but basically no one has made it work in an EV. Fisker claimed the following in an interview in 2017:

“It’s mainly been dismissed for automotive because it’s very expensive to make, it doesn’t have the power, and it doesn’t work below zero,” said Fisker. “We have cracked all three of these areas.” \[5\]

In a vehicle like the EMotion, it could easily permit a 700-mile range, he said. \[5\]

“This isn’t just a lab test; we’ve actually built the batteries,” \[5\]

They had hired a man named Fabio Albano from a company called Sakti3 who made a lot of bold claims about solid state batteries, but according to the following:

“To date \[1/18/2018\], none of the companies involved—Dyson, Fisker, or the former Sakti3, which is now a subsidiary of Dyson—have demonstrated a working, full-size automotive solid-state battery prototype and the most Fisker has shown the public is a block of material from a supposed solid-state battery.” \[7\]

From the same article: “But it's Fisker's insistence its solid-state battery technology works, the secrecy around it, and how much the company is reliant on it coming to fruition that calls into question the entire company, not just the car.” \[7\]

Back to the cars. The Fisker Orbit (vaporcar 3) was announced in 2018 as another very pretty drawing. “For now, the Orbit is being kept under wraps, but Fisker is hoping to bring the actual vehicles out into the world for a pilot at the end of 2019. “We are looking to start driving that around and testing it on a campus in the second half of next year.” He shared that the pilot would not be, as I expected, in China, but instead would be deployed at a campus in the United States.” \[8\]

By 2019, Fisker had apparently moved vaporcar 2 and vaporcar 3 to the back burner and was pushing his SUV for the masses (eventually to become the Ocean). He announced they would have a driveable prototype of the SUV by the end of the year (2019) \[10\], and were tooling up their own factory for production \[9\]. 

2020 was a big year where they went public, and secured a manufacturing deal with Magna. With Magna able to engineer and manufacture an entire vehicle, maybe things are looking up?

**Chapter 4: Foxconn**

File this under, OH GOD WHY?!?! You have a manufacturer. That does reputable work for reputable car companies. Why would you announce partnering with a second manufacturer, who specializes in cell phones, who has a reputation for valuing PR over production, and has never mass produced anything larger than a tablet!? Foxconn is the apparent manufacturer of the yet to be unveiled “Pear” concept. The Pear also exists only as a drawing on a napkin (vapor-ish car 4). Will Magnus allow you to take their design and components to a competitor for manufacturing, or do you plan to start all over from the ground up? Does Foxconn even know how to build a car? Do they have sourcing relationships for the car parts? Do they have anything to offer other than whispers of “Apple” in the press? This truly baffles me. 

**Chapter 5: I’m Exhausted**

I’m so tired of writing this, I’d be amazed if anyone reads it all the way through. I just want to briefly mention the current leadership of the company. Fisker Inc. has Henrik’s wife as CFO. This is a huge red flag for me when there’s an external relationship between the CEO and the CFO. Many shenanigans can ensue. The board also is full of lawyers and bankers (again), not people with auto industry experience. The one leadership position that has auto industry experience is the Chief Technology Officer (who is not a board member). 

**Chapter 6: Industry Saturation**

I think if he is able to strengthen ties with Magnus, and they can rope him into building a practical car, they may get the Ocean out to consumers. However, it will be too late. As I mentioned in my first write up, the EV market is already nearing saturation (see Tesla’s declining sales numbers), and the big boys (GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes) are still yet to fully enter the game. And the Ocean is also (optimistically) 3 years away. People will not wait that long. They will cancel their $250 reservations and buy a car that’s at the lot down the road.

&#x200B;

Ok, so is Henrik going to be successful? I doubt it. He seems to have learned nothing from his past experiences and has a track record of inflated promises, poor decision making, unrealistic timelines, and not being able to deliver. The sum of all these parts to me shows a portrait of a company that will not be anything but another extension of his ego. They seem to not even be designing the car (Magnus is), and I can’t decide what value they add other than the name on the front. 

&#x200B;

As always, these are my personal thoughts for entertainment purposes only and are not intended as trading advice. Do your own DD you bunch of crazy monkeys.

The only argument you actually made is ""Based on Toyota’s market cap per car produced and Fisker’s 200,000 car production target the stock is worth $14."" This is still a hilariously oversimplified way to value a company. A better comparison would be Tesla trades 6.5x 2025 revenues, Nio 3.25x and Fisker currently less than .5x. Meaning if it hits production at just a 1x multiplier it is worth $40.

But as head honcho and the leash gone he doesn’t understand the tech or business of his own industry. He just knows what sounds or looks cool.

Every successful car company is vertically integrated for a reason. Every company that tries to side step that fails sooner or later and if they get a product out it’s a disaster. The Ocean has been delayed multiple times. The semiconductor chip shortage is going to delay him again, which will most likely be the catalyst for a drop soon.

mek4lo,,wallstreetbets,post,1616871487,"Peruvian elections and why I'm shorting SCCOAs you degenerates may know, copper has skyrocketed thanks to the Chinese demand. This is not expected to last as Chinese regulations melt the demand, so the price is probably going down in a month or two.

Now, this doesn't seem like a good reason to see why the price of Southern Copper Corporation would go down, but just keep that in mind with what I'm gonna say next.

SCCO's copper supply depends heavily on Peruvian mines. Although they hold mines in Mexico, their biggest mines are located in Southern Peru (hence the name). The situation there for Southern and other mining companies is pretty bad in some places as rural locals and environmentalists oppose anything mine-related. One of their biggest projects, Tia Maria, has been stagnating for five years, and the people opposing the project have voted for politicians with an anti-mine stance since 2015. 

In 2016, in the same region that the Tia Maria protests started, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski won the vote due to his half-assed remark about consulting with the people first (in other words, no mine). Eventually, this man would become president and, like expected, nothing would happen. Now the political scene in Peru is facing the same situation, but this time it will be even worse. 

The biggest candidate in the polls for the 2021 elections (EDIT: Elections are on April 11) is Yonhy Lescano, a nationalist who sternly opposes Tia Maria and another big project for another company and plans to regulate the mining industry. You probably know what this means for mining investors and the already existing companies there. 

The second candidate in the polls, George Forsyth, doesn't really have a stance on the issue, so we can expect the project to stagnate too if he wins. The third biggest candidate, Rafael Lopez de Aliaga, also opposes the project. Of all the candidates I only know one who's in favor of it, and it's very unlikely that he will win. The rest have half-assed opinions that will also end up being a ""Nah we'll keep you waiting for 5 more years.""

If candidate Yonhy Lescano wins, that will be the end of Southern Copper, and I bet the price will tank to 2008 levels. The decrease may be similar if another candidate who shares that stance wins, especially because the demand bubble appears to be close to bursting. If the price goes (or stays) up, SCCO would be missing out on huge revenues, which will disappoint investors. If it goes down, well, the stock is fucked.",['DE']

me3yzj,,wallstreetbets,post,1616809803,"$GME Potential Pattern: Cup with Handle Analysis Part 2. Bullish handle breakout analysis – MACD, W%R, DMI based analysis. With other examples this time!First things first, here is where we are with some pretty lines drawn in:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mrw4w3sw6hp61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3000cf6d8e93869b0118d540ecaca36b2637e73d

Second things second, let’s take a look at the updated conditions we discussed in the first post:

According to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:

&#x200B;

1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**
2. **Cup:** The cup should be “U” shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A “V” shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ½. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little wary, and I still stand by this. **Updated**: However, at this point we can say GME is not a textbook example so the depths might be less of a factor.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again? Updated:** At this point it may be safe to say that the textbook depths do not really apply. We have fallen out of 1/3 and even 1/2 depths, and there is reason to be wary. However, this might not really matter for GME.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. Almost there. **Updated: Check**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Updated: 50 Million Volume to go from closing 120 to closing 180. There is definitely momentum here. Previous resistance of 172 broken. Check**

Okay, so now let’s look at the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2xt3t0v27hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cb794baa796b3147084a004f425523e2d72a6f

We can see here that +DI and -DI are diverging, signaling bullish sentiment. W%R slipped into a strong overselling signal on 3/24, and then on 3/25 it moved sharply towards the middle. This means the stock is starting to be more bought than sold. The MACD histogram is growing in momentum, 3/24 being the most negative day.

So great! It looks like there could be a breakout forming here. But now what? How long does it go for and what can we expect? Well let’s look at historical examples:

Here is the textbook Investopedia example, WYNN on monthly candles:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9otqyu887hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=02d2c757c8c2795ae0382155dfa9c5316ea88fc3

We can see that when there is a breakout in the handle, the bullish movement pushed the price to go above previous cup resistances. However, after the breakout the price of the stock free falls down almost to previous cup support levels:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9xnvryu97hp61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93ed2f9927a28e968e62a36636c81d8d4db7011

Okay now you may be saying, this is so zoomed out and candles are months ect, ect, ect. This is simply the Investopedia textbook example. Lets look at another more recent one.

Here is NVDA on daily candles:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zpwtlgrb7hp61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1e72aac25924a18b7f8d2a4b6f1c125e39697cd

Here is what happened after the run up, as you can see this stock kept running up after the handle breakout:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mctgfxpe7hp61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e9b7105444cbc54cf0831fc71323ded4c1a595

All of this is just information. I hope you take it with a grain of salt! If a true cup with handle pattern forms and the breakout of the handle happens, then we know prices run up at least to the previous resistance. Until that happens its hard to say what's next!

So the projected price would be 150+100=250$ which is around where it went. 247$. If we apply the same analysis we can roughly estimate gme cup depth to be 300-50=250$. 250+300=550$.,['WYNN']
me96s8,,wallstreetbets,post,1616830776,"Take care of your neurons during stressful market times.The neurotransmitter dopamine is an important modulator of neuronal signaling and circuit activation. Physical and psychological stressors activate brain dopaminergic circuits, which, in turn, lead to both acute and long-term changes in neural functions. Dopamine systems contribute to the generation of the stress response and to coping responses to stress via the coregulation of additional chemical transmitters. Regulation of dopamine release and receptor signaling is exquisitely sensitive to certain genetic and environmental perturbations during development and in adulthood. 

Individual variation in coping responses to stress has been correlated with differences in dopamine-related genes and dopamine neuron structure and firing patterns. Many of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra project to the striatum, another part of the basal ganglia that is made up of the caudate and putamen. In doing so they form a pathway called the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway that is thought to be crucial in the facilitation of movement. 

Stress is influencing dopamine production and negatively impacts the function of the substantia nigra. The influence of the substantia nigra on movement is made apparent by observing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which are associated with the death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although it still isn't clear what exactly causes neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, when a significant number of these neurons have died, the individual will likely start to experience movement-related problems like tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability—all hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 

**TL:DR: Don't make your bad swing trades or dips hurt your substantia nigra. Take care of your neurons or your hands will be shaking, so you will make more bad trades. The market eventually will go up, but neural damage is permanent.**",

The last time it was blocked was in 1967. What happened in 1967? Ships heading to Europe from Asia had to go around the horn of Africa, adding up to 12,000 miles to their journey. 

This meant that the crews had to stop along the way for fuel and provisions. They stopped at the biggest port in Africa which was in South Africa. Many companies also offloaded goods at a discount in South Africa.

 This sent the entire economy of South Africa into hyperdrive. Look at a GDP chart for south africa and you'll see the huge jump in 1967. Their stock market rallied because of it too.

The same dynamic is playing out today. Suez canal has been blocked for 4 days. It is likely to be blocked for MONTHS. That means a lot of ships will be stopping in South Africa,  sending their economy to the moon for thhe first time since the 1960s.

The guy who was trying to short south Africa ETFs a while back had some solid DD, but the suez canal blockage is about to suck all the money out of his brokerage account. That ship has been there for 4 days and there is no sign that it will be out soon. Most likely it will be MONTHS of losses for him.

mdpi46,,wallstreetbets,post,1616767847,"I’ve lost everything because of the Suez Canal fiasco on the Egyptian/ European Easter bunny future run upI spent $50,000 on surefire Egyptian bunny rabbit futures. This was money that was supposed to be saved for buying a new house and was mainly accrued from dumping pay checks into SPY over the years. 

On the 27th of February , I got tipped off from a buddy that works in the bunny breeding industry. He said that due to the pandemic, Europeans were buying pets like crazy, and one animal in particular... bunny rabbits. 

Now this made me look into Egyptian bunny futures as they produce the most bunnies in the world. The premiums were amazing, this was like buying fucking apple at IPO. On top of all of this, Easter was just a couple months around the corner and a massive shipment of bunnies was meant to leave Egypt and make its way to a port in France. I’m talking a fucking boat load of carrot munching, sex hungry, “what’s up doc” mother fuckers, not just a container. 

So I placed my bet, expiring the week of Easter, for when the shipment would come. Since there were barely any bunnies in France/ all of Europe, there was no supply to meet demand. However, I had it on good authority that prices would barely drop since so many Europeans wanted the little fluffy fucks. 

All was going well, my money was going up and it was the most euphoric feeling ever...

Until on Wednesday at 10am, I wake up to check how many unrealized tendies I have. To my horror I was down 48%. I frantically called my aforementioned buddy in the industry and he tells me to look up the Suez canal. 

It turns out the shipment was delayed by a day out of Egypt and right after they left port, some big fucking ship decided to block the whole canal. Since Egypt shipped out essentially every last bunny in the damn country, they didn’t need any more bunny food. So every single one of them is going to run out of food over the next week and die on that ship (no point in bringing them back to port cause there’s no food to feed them). Once they arrive in France they will dump the dead bunnies, pick up the next shipment and move on.

Ok wrinkle brains, I have some actual investment trickery to wet your appetite.

Raytheon  Technologies (RTX) begins liquidating $1.2 billion of OTIS stock from  its Employee 401k plan starting on April 5th and ending approximately 60  days later. The OTIS 401k fund is 99% common stock and 1% cash (cash is  kept in the fund to make payouts/transfers easier). That is currently  \~4% of Otis's Market cap.

Why  would they do this you might ask? OTIS used to be a part of RTX, but was  split off (along with Carrier) in a 2020 deal that made them three  separate companies with three separate stock tickers: RTX, OTIS, and  CARR. Apparently aircraft don't have elevators, who knew?

RTX was perfectly okay being  invested in Otis and Carrier when they belonged to the company.  However, now they are separate companies, and having your employee's  401ks largely invested in two individual stocks unrelated to the company  does not make any sense especially when the rest of the 401k plan is  composed of very broad ETFs.

Ok, so why $65 puts for April 16th if this selloff is going to occur over the course of 60 days?

1. RTX  told all its employees that they had until April 2nd to manually move  their funds into another ETF in their 401k or RTX would start moving  funds out for them and alerting them each time money is moved. My guess  is not many people have moved their money out yet but will do so once  they start receiving emails that their investments are being moved/sold  off each week.
2. The  people actually running the RTX 401k are pretty smart and will move  money out of OTIS at weekly/monthly highs, but employees will just  transfer funds out when they start getting emails regardless of whether  it was a good time to sell or not. This will trigger panic/algo selling  as up to 4% of OTIS (guessing it'll be more like 2-3%) will be sold off  in large chunks throughout the next few weeks, sometimes at the low for  the day. I think this could drive the stock down potentially 10% to \~$60  at its lowest.
3. OTIS happened to be at an ATH on no company specific news so what better time to get monthly puts?

Source:  I have a friend who works at RTX. I assume this is public knowledge  somewhere on some fancy SEC document but I can't read.

EDIT:

Link to actual sources below. 1st link explains the liquidation. 2nd link explains how employees can transfer funds out of OTIS.

Also,  link look at pgs 46-47 in the pdf below (created 09-30-2020, there is a  12/31/2020 one as well if you search). It lists out the amount of $ in  each of the OTIS funds which you'll find match closely with the $1.2  billion I listed above. More importantly look at the note under ""Trading  Restriction"" on those pages and compare them to the restrictions on the  non-OTIS and non-Carrier funds. Employees stopped being able to move  money into those funds over 6 months ago.

Otherwise I get so high that I lose all risk aversion, and start imagining future chart moves that are based on no DD at all. I start chasing strength instead of making the difficult plays that feel like they can’t possibly be good, but then they are. It’s a delicate balance to cool off, but not so much that you stop trading and turn into a totally risk averse pussy.

Yep, you'll find none of those here, instead we'll just be focusing purely on the options OI numbers.

This past week, 🦍🦍🦍 not coordinated enough to launch this movement by themselves, so a friendly neighborhood 🐋 had to step in and show how it's done.

🦍🦍🦍 wanna hop on a 🚀 to Mars right ? Do you know how the Rover actually got to Mars ? Not by only using 🚀🚀🚀 but also inertia and gravitational pulls.

[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/teach/activity/lets-go-to-mars-calculating-launch-windows/](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/teach/activity/lets-go-to-mars-calculating-launch-windows/)

https://i.redd.it/21g929bl1hp61.gif

What about something further, like a comet ? Same thing, just with a lot more orbital jumps

https://i.redd.it/0v3qr32n1hp61.gif

Only Looking at the near term OI expiries, is like looking through a telescope and seeing the Sun then wrongly concluding that the Sun is the biggest source of gravitational pull in space.  In fact however, the Sun orbits the center of the Milky way galaxy, where there's this HUGE blackhole pulling the entire galaxy towards it. While the Milky Way galaxy itself is moving away from the big bang, bound together by the common gravity of the Local galaxy group that contains Andromeda, Triangulum, Large Megalanic Clouds, M32 and many others. 

So you got all this gravitational effects overlapping each other, which is kinda what delta/gamma is on the price, that's why **you need to sum across ALL strikes and expiries to get an accurate reading on price direction, hence the  calculator**. This works extremely well for $GME because the move since February was mostly due to gamma.

For next week, the friendly neighborhood 🐋 will be busy avoiding whalers with harpoons and has other stuff to attend to, so it'll be up to the 🦍🦍🦍 to do this themselves.

Take a step back and look at the hourly time frame. GME had a huge 50+% day yesterday and dropped only <2% today. This is just healthy consolidation on LOW Daily volume.

This is what bulls want. RSI has cooled down on hourly. It's holding moving average supports and I'm thinking it will go back and retest today's highs next week. You want this to stair-step up when we don't have low volume and when big money steps in (notice how much room CMF has to curl up), then that's the big 20, 30, 40+% days.

**TA:**  
1. 8/21 Cross on verge of happening on the 65 minute chart.  
2. bullish divergence on the 65min RSI  
3. TTM Squeeze indicating a push up on the 65min

&#x200B;

**Speculative / Drivers** 

1. Short Interest is 47.99% Of free float  
2. There are 7.68million shares covered in 13fs  
3. 20 million total shares available in float, with 13.29 million being borrowed/shorted

**Thoughts On Entry:**

Break of 38.99 gives confirmation of a long entry

&#x200B;

**Options and strategies in play:**

4/16 $40 strikes -   
5/21 $40 / $ 50 Vertical Spread - Cheap Cost of entry - good return potential

&#x200B;

**Theta In play:**

Sell 4/16 $35 puts - potentially 9% return on capital.  
Sell 4/16 $40 strikes - Potential 17% return on capital 

&#x200B;

**Swing Equity:**  
Enter Shares, Sell monthlies - capture gains, and cover potential losses with premium gain

&#x200B;

**What i'm doing:** 

Synthetic long.  
Sell 4/16 $40 Puts (assignment price $33change) Premium capture -  $700ish - Take Premium and and purchase: 4/16 $38 calls.
