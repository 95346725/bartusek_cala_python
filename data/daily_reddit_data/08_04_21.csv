mmsnc1,,stocks,post,1617891062,"Lumber DD: CNBC and Motley Fool's ""Best Lumber Stocks"" Unsurprisingly Are the Worst Price Performers or Are Unrelated to LumberI had to do this cathartic post because it is hilarious how wrong/clueless the mainstream financial analysts continue to be when discussing how investors could benefit as investors from the historic surge in lumber prices.

**Context for anyone living under a rock the last 6 months**

Lumber has been surging to all-time high prices recently, with every indication that it will continue to climb for the next few months due to how massive the new home construction demand and the busy season just getting started.  The price of dimensional lumber will likely dip at some point but will still stay at 2-3x its normal price into 2022 because of how insane the new housing construction boom.  

For those that have suggested otherwise in recent reddit posts, you’re wrong and this post isn’t about that debate.  Go look at the 2021 and 2022 projections for all of the big home builders (KB, TOL, LEN, DHI, etc…).  Every single one is projected to have record earnings the next two years from increased home construction even with the surge in lumber prices.

**The Financial Click-Bait “Best Lumber Stocks”**

If you’re new to lumber and google lumber stocks to maybe see what options are out there to look into, you no doubt have run into the same laughably annoying phenomenon that I did: the mainstream financial media/internet clickbait sites (like CNBC and Motley Fool) keep on producing the same regurgitated articles titled the “Best ___ Lumber Stocks” or “Best Ways to Play the Lumber Surge” which then offer the same regurgitated hot stock tips: 

1) they recommend stocks that produce exclusively **timber** (like RYN) which get NO BENEFITS from the surge in **lumber** prices *because timber (the logs which lumber is made from) aren’t the commodity whose price is surging 3-fold*; 

2) they recommend stocks that get a large portion of their revenue/enterprise value from things other than lumber (or have such a large stock float) so that the benefits of the lumber surge will be pretty diffuse and not have a proportional impact on their stock price (e.g. WY, a clickbait favorite); or 

3) they pitch stocks like LL, Home Depot and Lowes who have done well riding the home improvement wave, but don’t actually produce their dimensional lumber at all and thus have absolutely nothing to gain from the surge in dimensional lumber prices.

For those who want to invest in this lumber super cycle, it probably would be a good idea to invest in companies *whose earnings are actually tied to the price of lumber.*  Companies like WFG, CFPZF, IFSPF and RFP (This list is not exhaustive; these are just examples).  Companies like these that largely base almost all of their income on dimensional lumber, along with wood pulp and paper for some.  (Note: wood pulp surging to a new high as well, so these guys coincidentally are enjoying a double whammy this year).  And unlike WY, these lumber players don’t have nearly the volume of outstanding shares, so the surge in lumber prices is going to translate in a proportionally larger EPS growth.

If you look at the stock price histories of these lumber companies and compare it to the historical price of lumber, their prices largely track with the changes in lumber (and to some degree wood pulp pricing).  2013 and 2018 had surges in the price of lumber and these companies’ stock prices correlated with those surges.  Why? Because the price of lumber and wood pulp dictate these companies’ earnings.  If you look at the timber companies, like WY and RYN, their stock prices don’t track well to lumber prices because the price of timber is separate.  In fact, despite the epic lumber surge, some timber producers are still not doing well because there is a big glut of it in some areas of the continent.

**Let’s Look at the Numbers**

In the end, it’s the numbers that matter, so let’s look at the price performance of these stocks YTD, the last 6 months and the last year.  CNBC and Motley pitched RYN, WY, LL, HD, and LOW as the best stocks to play the lumber surge.  Let’s see how they have done the last year during this surge compared to the actual lumber companies:

**Shill Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/ihngsVA), [6 Months]( https://imgur.com/a/2LlbPN7), and [1 Year](https://imgur.com/a/GMgb6Ta)

Other than LL, all of them have been doing ok.  Some decent growth, all decently beating the SP.  But nothing spectacular and certainly nothing showing explosive stock price growth correlating with lumber’s explosive growth. (I’ll address outlier LL later.)

Now look at the **Lumber Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/CnYBrAb), [6 Months](https://imgur.com/a/qjTCQRQ), and [1 year](https://imgur.com/a/PAXODpp) 

I included WY to prove a point on how badly CNBC and Motley’s favorite “Best” pick has done compared to the actual lumber stocks.  If you look at their growth, as a group its substantially larger than WY or RYN, or these home improvement store stocks. 

**Take away from the charts:** 

The lumber stocks as a group have so far *destroyed* the shill stocks and actually show the type of growth you’d expect from a historic commodity surge.  Unsurprisingly, these lumber stocks particularly destroyed WY which is the most shilled stock by the financial clickbait media, and is probably why WY then seems to be regurgitated in a lot of the recent reddit posts on Canadian lumber stocks.  

For those correctly pointing out that LL is up 500% in the last year, if you caught that party in Q4, good job.  RFP is still beating than LL by over 200%, but still, great job.  That being said, LL’s surge isn’t because of lumber prices and any future growth again won’t be from the surge in price in dimensional lumber.  And you know that because the price of lumber has surged higher in the last three months, but LL is down ~20% in that same time frame.  Frankly, if you bought LL when CNBC told you to in January 2021, you’d be down 20-25%.  The point being that what propelled LL was not the surge in lumber and it’s future is not likely tied to any sustained lumber surge.

**Forward Looking Comments**

For those cynics who keep saying “Lumber cycle is over.  It’s priced in,” you don’t know what you’re talking about and here’s why.  These Canadian lumber stocks are all sitting roughly around their mid 2018 highs when Lumber surged to $600 MBF for 3 weeks in May 2018, and averaged about $550 MBF during the forestry’s Q2, and then crashed Q3/Q4 2018.  

For comparison, in 2021, lumber has been trading at over $1000 MBF since February, and the May futures just topped $1050 this week. [Here’s the CME futures yesterday.](https://imgur.com/a/TRWdKvE)  January 2022 futures are now closing in on $800 MBF.  It seems pretty clear all of these futures are rising and will continue to due so in the near term.  2021 earnings will likely blow 2018’s out of the water.  Yet despite the fact that these futures show these companies are about the have some of the best back-to-back quarters in industry history, they are still sitting at their 2018 highs... doesn’t sound priced in to me.

Case in point, here’s the basic [valuation ratios for the Lumber Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/fiefWln), and here’s the [valuation ratios for the Shill Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/8jd6SsU).  Despite the epic run these lumber stocks have had this last year, they are largely *still* relatively undervalued and have drastically better forward PE’s when compared to the shill stocks or other related industrial sector averages.  

**Conclusion**

I needed to write this cathartic post because I am sick of seeking these financial “professionals” shill the same mediocre/loser stocks as “the best lumber stocks” which have nothing to do with the production of lumber or are literally the worst price performers in the sector.  

I am not telling you what to buy and can’t predict who will do the best this year.  Each of the lumber stocks have their advantage and disadvantages depending on investor preferences. And who knows, maybe these shill stocks are on the cusp of some epic 1000% gains.  But if you want to find a way to benefit from the lumber surge, then it may be wise to invest in *lumber producers* who actually stand to directly gain from the surge in lumber and still have unrealized value to offer if market conditions stay on their current trajectory.  

If you are unsure if a stock you are looking at is timber or lumber, look at financial statements / website.  You will be able to see in a matter of seconds if their earnings come from timber and real estate or wood products/lumber that are actually surging in value.

Note: I am not a financial adviser.  If there is one take away from this post, **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**  Don’t trust strangers on the internet or TV.  Many of them are either lazy morons who keep regurgitating the same brainless clickbait they read somewhere or they have an ulterior motive and are selling you garbage. I'm long RFP but recognize that all of these lumber stocks will probably do well.","['CME', 'GOOGL', 'DHI', 'WY', 'HD', 'LEN']"

So i'd be careful about investing in lumber, eventually we're going to hit a massive surplus most likely next year looking at how futures are trading and if we don't get a spike in covid.

mmz6hl,,stocks,post,1617909354,"For Those Owning 30+ Stocks - Why?I was thinking about this the other day and I remember seeing people in this sub that have portfolios that hold more than 30 stocks. I've seen upwards to 50+ stocks in one portfolio.

Personally, my portfolio has roughly 15 stocks and in the New Years I made a few rotations and now currently have 12 individual companies. I have a goal to analyze one company a week. I would gather up news articles, etc. throughout the week and read the annual/ quarterly reports throughout the week and do all the financial analysis and modelling on the weekend. This is typically enough work for me to keep me busy, along with keeping up to date with the ER for the current holdings. 

Which brings me to a few questions in your massive portfolio: how are you keeping up to date with them and how are you selecting them? If you are investing to ""diversify"" your portfolio, why don't you just use an ETF to diversify instead?",
mmz6hl,gtuhsmo,stocks,comment,1617910403,"Here's my portfolio performance since I first opened my brokerage account:

[Portfolio performance vs net investment](https://imgur.com/ptS1C6k)

I was mostly throwing money into ETFs and mutual funds prior to 2017 at which time I started getting a little more serious about investing.

At my peak (last December timeframe), there were nearly 100 different investments spread across several different accounts. I do have a 'robo advisor' account which buys and sells a bunch of Schwab ETFs, gold, etc and there are about 15 different investments in that account alone.

Since December I've consolidated a lot and have cut that number down significantly.  As you can see by the above chart, my portfolio balance has done pretty well.

My investment strategy was a mix of investing in what I know / believe in (tech, green energy) as well as doing research on companies I found via Reddit and other investment websites. I'm also a long term holder.  I don't really buy anything with less than a 5 year sell timeframe.

I feel like finding valid companies now via websites/reddit is a lot harder than it was pre-GME.  Now everyone is trying to pump a bunch of crap and it's really hard to sift through to find the hidden gems.

Do I advocate having a ton of investments?  No.  Has it worked well enough for me? Yeah.",

mmtv9z,,stocks,post,1617894576,"A rare bullish DD for PLUG, & Hydrogen in generalI wrote this originally as a comment, but it got upvotes relatively quickly, so I think I'll make a DD on this. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. I have my eyes on $APD, personally I think thats a good long term bet, but PLUG is one of them more riskier plays. With their creation of Hydrogen plants, plus one of the biggest hydrogen plants in the US, I'm very confident they will be profitable in the future. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

My thoughts on PLUG is that it's a bit of a lottery play. Their hydrogen plants should make them profitable in the future pretty easily, but any major developments in their fuelcell technology, or any adoption of their technology in popular car brands could easily give them a triple digit valuation over the next 10 years. However, I'm extremely bullish on Hydrogen producers, like $APD. They have great earnings, normal P/E ratios, and great growth prospects over the coming years.",['APD']

mmt6jd,,stocks,post,1617892593,"What stocks are actually well priced or even undervalued right now or is the answer nothing?I'm looking at the market and it seems like most stocks are still heavily inflated. Tech seems to be down, however, does seems like it'll likely be a bit shaky in the near future, given interest rates, inflation, heavy market uncertainty, and actually when you zoom out on the 1-year graph, most of tech is still very high, compared to just under a year ago. The losses from many posts seem to just be from people buying at ATHs. 

On another note, non-tech stocks looks like they're more likely to go up in the near future, however have now already risen, and at all time highs, or near it. I'm looking at Starbucks, JPM, DIS, TGT, but really works for most promising non-tech stocks.    


Seems like we're basically choosing between decent, not necessarily good or bad, but just okay priced stocks that will probably be flat in the near future, and will become a long-hold, or stocks that may also be a great long-term hold, but at very ATH prices, that we should probably expect the major gains to be over, and will likely just to be buying to go up 10% end of year, unless there's something I'm overlooking, of course ""well priced"" is also subjective, so figured I'd ask and grab some opinions.","['JPM', 'TGT', 'DIS', 'SBUX']"

mn06x7,,stocks,post,1617912176,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 8, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 8, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

mmg71k,,stocks,post,1617842710,"""fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”Looking at Mungers recent position, 20% of the portfolio is going to China's $BABA. This really brought to my attention Buffet's quote of ""be fearful when others are **greedy**, and **greedy** when others are fearful.” I noticed this is occurring within your typical Chinese stocks. Many of these we talk about quite often in this sub. 

Looking at companies like $BABA, $TME, $BIDU, $JD and $IQ, most of them have fallen anywhere from 15-48%. Recent news has mentioned that the hedge funds and banks are letting go of their Chinese holdings but I believe this is a great buying opportunity strictly due to the low prices and Munger's new position. 

Most of them still have pretty high analyst PT's but their P/E's and P/S's stick out like a sour thumb. All of these companies are stuck below the 42 zone on the RSi and show massive growth for the EPS. Being able to pay off any debts and having Jack Ma, the idiot who spoke against a communist government finally out from CEO of BABA, may now let us see the only upside potential we've been waiting for. BTW, hearing Munger's opinion on Jack Ma's actions and him stepping down seriously makes me believe BABA is a gold mine with purchasing LEAPS. Much more of a safer bet with him out of the eqaution. 

I still have a great interest in these companies and want to hear some of your opinions on this. I did purchase today 600 shares of $IQ @ 18.54 to add a new stock into my portfolio with me already having LEAPS on BABA and a decent amount of money in JD @ 84 per share. Even though the hedge funds and banks are dumping their stakes, I believe it has the potential to make solid, big gains. ",

Looking at Chargepoint and Blink charging.  They've had insane runups the past year.  My understanding is that it wasn't anything these companies did, but they just happened to be EV charging companies right as Biden took presidency and legislation started to get written in for EV.  They're just riding the wave.  I feel like people are just rushing into these charging stocks based on the sector alone and not the company.  Both have very high short interest.

For ex, Blink charging - How are they worth 2bil?  According to yahoo finance their total revenue in 2020 was 6.23 million.  Although it's significant growth from the year before, they're unprofitable and are in a business with thin margins.  Although there's the infrastructure bill, there's no news as to whether Blink has actually been offered government contracts, and that larger competitors will get them instead.  The culper research report didn't help either.

However, blink is in the right space and is an early player in the booming space.  What are your thoughts?  Is this an EV charging bubble just like weed stocks not too long ago?  What will be the catalyst to bring things back down?  Could these companies actually ever somehow justify their valuations?

Thanks!",

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

PS: I upvoted you all so far, love this late(early) discussion. Going to sleep now. Whether you agree with me or not, I wish you all solid gains. It is not about you or them, or your gains vs his/her loss. I hope you all make gains and that my small insite can lead future generations(or my own or past) to an easy life where we maybe don't have yachts or pent houses, but at the same time.... have to die young of stress and ill health, and can just have the money to be content and happy and be like me,... spending this week digging a new garden, and not be broken old men/women like I see so often.

And if you dont like that, if you say everyone should ""pull up them boot straps"" then I say Fuk you. That didn't work. So I won, and I hope I can teach even one kid to win to

mn0182,,stocks,post,1617911733,"7 Must Know Things Right Now About The Stock Market (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More)**In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

mmwvmk,,stocks,post,1617903029,"Managing Emotions When Buying Into a StockHello,

I'm a new and young investor who is interested in making long-term buys of companies I think will do well long-term. I've read The Intelligent Investor and I've really taken to heart the idea to buy stocks for the long term. 

I understand that compound interest is the best way to go, but once I'm interested in a stock, it's hard for me not to immediately buy and wait for a good price. I think ""oh, I don't want this stock to increase in price before I buy it, so I'll buy it now."" With compound growth, even a 5-10% difference in the short term doesn't make much difference in the long term. 

For example, if I find a stock I like and conclude from my research I like it, even if the stock is on a big up day, I'll buy it immediately. 

How do you manage your emotions when buying and make plans to buy into a stock you like? Is a short term DCA (over something like the span of a few weeks) a good idea?

Thanks!",

mmar4u,,stocks,post,1617826093,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 7, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021**

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the \[FOMC’s\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.”

You do not have to answer all of them, but it’s strongly preferred. here as follows: 

What age did you start investing?

Why and how did you start investing?

Do you still invest (I’m assuming yes if you’re on this subreddit lol)

What advice would you give to someone looking to invest in stocks for the first time?

How did you choose what stocks you invested in?

What is an emerging market that’s worth investing in your opinion?

What types of sticks do you personally think people should avoid?

What do you think your stocks will look like in the upcoming months?

Have you ever made a mistake when investing in stocks? If so, can you elaborate?

What would you do if your stocks began to rapidly decline?

What are some other things you can invest in aside from stocks, and do you think people are aware of those options? 

Anything else you’d like to share?",

2. My finances became settled, my wife and I started making more money, had some extra income beyond normal savings, pension fund contributions, college savings plan for kids, etc.

3. Yes - I don’t actively trade regularly - but I check frequently just to see news about stocks I’m in.

4. Invest in what you know - you should be able to explain in three sentences what a company does and why you’re invested. Start small - watch and see how things work. Index funds and ETFs are a good starting point while you’re learning. 

5. Various reasons - mostly in large cap stable stocks. BA, WFC, AAPL, TGT, DIS, etc. I know it’s not likely to 10x my money, but just looking for consistent growth over long period (30 years)

6. Marijuana, alternative energy, and bioscience/pharma, fintech.

7. Stocks they can’t explain what the company does. Penny stocks are basically gambling. 

8. Month too small of a window to have any clue what they’ll look like. 

9. Of course - but just basics like bought too high (what I thought was a dip, but it dipped more), sold with meat on the bone, etc. - but I haven’t made any like I bought 1,000 shares when I wanted to buy 100 shares.

10. Nothing - unless something has drastically changed about the company. If AAPL dives 10% in a week - I’m not selling. If I have free cash - I might buy more. 

11. Property. Precious metals. Art. Most of those are beyond most normal people aside from the house they own.","['BA', 'DIS', 'WFC', 'TGT', 'AAPL']"

2. Girlfriend broke up with me, wanted to make her regret it
3. Yes but I short sell most of the time
4. Start investing in companies you use in your life, but at the same time if you are young invest in a penny stock and a few other “What If” tech stocks. This helps you understand how the market works and you’ll appreciate the value of a dollar more
5. I did my research, sat on my computer a lot and just watched the candles do their thing. For shorting I see what’s being talked about a lot and also use stock screeners to find breakouts
6. Drone Industry and EV
7. Any Pharma stocks and Penny Stocks (after your initial investment into a penny stock as I stated in an earlier answer)
8. My one penny stock AITX is going to explode and be in the dollar range by the end of 2022, my drone stocks will do well besides EHang which I’m holding till 2022 Olympics then immediately dumping, I love shorting and what I wanna short is to be determined. Any profit I make from shorting generally goes to ETF’s 
9. I invested based off of friend’s DD rather than doing my own. I also lost some money on AMC trying to “fit in.” Word of advice if WSB says do one thing, you do the opposite!
10. I would buy more shares if I believe in the company and I would hold if I have no additional funds. I have faith in my stocks and my short selling will more likely cover any losses I incur. 
10. People should really consider real estate or ETF’s if you want to invest but don’t like having to make your portfolio (doesn’t make sense to me but that’s just my opinion). I don’t think people are aware of these I think people focus too much on spending on physical products that bring them short-term satisfaction rather than long-term intangible wealth
Additional Comment: Invest as soon as you can! As soon as I started I stopped ordering food, i truly understood the value of a dollar, I live a poor lifestyle even though I’m relatively wealthy, and I have started finding hobbies to increase my wealth!",
mmy1qn,gtucw85,stocks,comment,1617908274,"Hey! For the record, I'm only 18 years, been learning about stocks and the market for about 3 months, so I even though I won't be able to provide the same advice as someone with experience would, I think a couple of things I know could help you!

&#x200B;

1. Started investing at 18
2. I have always been interested in financial related things, and I was always very careful with the way I spent money. So, as soon as I turned 18, wanted to learn how to make my money work for me
3. Yes still investing lol
4. If you're looking to invest: I recommend you don't for at least a few feeks / months (assuming you know nothing about the market and haven't done proper research. Especially with the recent instable market, don't jump in now. You might miss out on some profits, but you could also lose big. So learn what are stocks, etf, ctfs, mutual funds, try to learn the meaning of words (PE ratio, payout ratio, CAGR, etc.), then you will able to learn about specific companies / funds. Also, try understand the benefits of different investing strategies : Dividend growth investing (DGI), 3 fund investing, growth investing, etc. That will help you decide which type of investor you are and the reasons why you should stick to a SPECIFIC plan.
5. I haven't bought many things as of today, but I plan on doing that, and some factors influence me a lot. I'm canadian, so I try to limit the amount of US / World currency forex fees. Of course I can't buy Visa without exchanging currencies, but I try to find canadian ETFs tracking the US market or world market. Also, I know that I want to hold specific companies, and follow what's happening in their business. I don't want to passive invest in a mutual fund my whole life. So although I love some ETFs (SMH: Semi Conductors, VUN: Canadian equivalent of VTI, etc) I want to allocate a part of my portfolio to stock picking.
6. No idea tbh. Haven't done research on emerging market.
7. Speculative stocks. For example, many stocks in the EV / Green sector. I'm not against the green movement, I'm just against betting with no fundamentals. Yes, a certain company in the clean energy sector could be the next Chevron (CVX). But the chance of that happening is small, and I would much rather have lower returns than literally gambling my money. I think investing in Visa, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple is wiser than investing in already-over-valued companies.
8. Honestly, if financial analysts can't even properly predict that, no one on this subreddit can. But, in my newbie opinion, I think markets will trade sideways for a while. i don't expect a crash with all the printing / support that the American market receives, but a growth like the past year isn't sustainable.  But people have no reason atm with Covid to remove money from the market, so I don't see why it would crash.
9. If I have made a mistake? Going to early in the market. I bought some ARKG-ARKQ stocks a week or two after the initial correction in march, because I thought they were crazy cheap. Turns out that I dont even want to hold them anymore. Not because of the 5-10% loss, but only because these ETFs do not fit my investing mind and strategy. I chased performance and regretted it because I hold something I don't even like.  Also, although people say 'time in the market is more important than timing the market', don't listen to it when you're learning. Its a valuable strategy if you know what you're doing and following a specific strategy, but don't go all in right now, without enough information, just because you don't wanna miss out on some gains.
10. I would hold if my stocks were declining, depending on the reason. If I think the future of the company isn't at risk, I will hold. There's a reason why I bought the stock to begin with, and it's because I thought it had real future value, so I'm not going to sell because of a correction  (even 15%+ in price). Would I be anxious? Probably. But trading out of fear isn't going to resolve the problem : I still lost money. So before considering selling, I will try to see if my initial reason for investing still stand. If they do stand, then I hold.
11. Well, of course people know about stocks, ETFs, CTFs, mutual funds and the stock market in general. But, I invested some play money in crypto currency for a few reasons. I want to learn how it works, how it can be used, and why is it so popular. I understand, crypto is considered risky af and based on nothing as of today, but maybe that in the future, it will play a bigger role in our life, so I would much rather learn today than tomorrow. Also, you can invest in real estate, in YOURSELF (knowledge, fun, etc.). I dont know much about real estate though, so can't really elaborate. But I think enjoying my life is as important as having a good financial situation, so I won't drop my hobbies and the activities I love for the sake of increasing my networth. I limit my spendings on short-term benefits that aren't really useful, but still spend on what I love (family, girlfriend, etc.).","['NVDA', 'AAPL', 'CVX', 'MSFT']"

That's what a lot of those random capital stocks are.  Right now I'm up to about $50 a month from dividends which I am reinvesting.  My main concern is that moving forward past the summer, norweigein and spirit will even out (I do think it still has room to gain a bit) and I will be clueless what to do besides sell my shares...by that point ill have held for more than a year for tax purposes.

My goal is to continue to add maybe 100 bucks a week, maybe 50 into dividend/blue/whatever and have 50 a week for growth/tech/ or take some shots at more options.  (i have 1 long term with norweigein currently that I just added)

What are your thoughts on this company from the U.K. who are reimagining vehicle production methodologies whilst delivering EV niche for Commercial vehicles. In case you haven't seen any of their marketing material. 

Their main selling point is low capital microfactories that can be stood up in desired locations with little effort and limited space unlike traditional car manufacturing conveyor belt type traditional approach. I personally think this is a good approach to scaling and adapting to local needs. 

In their presentations they have referred to scaling to large number of factories over the next coming years and the strong revenue growth as a result. This may be optimistic but if they have the recipe to replicate then this will bring about a new standard in automotive manufacturing.

They have been working with UPS to design delivery vehicles and have said they have UPS order of over $1B - no doubt there are clauses attached to this and other orders Arrival speak of.

Also I'm sure they will benefit by the Infrastructure plan recently touted by Biden.

mmcfar,,stocks,post,1617830866,"U.S. Market Recap - Wednesday, April 7, 2021**Dow +0.05%, S&P 500 +0.15%, Nasdaq (0.07%), Russell 2000 (1.60%)**

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities were little changed in quiet Wednesday trading. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq were narrowly mixed while Russell 2000 was under pressure. Sectors mixed. Communications services, tech, energy best performers. Materials worst performer on chemicals weakness. Industrials a laggard with most sub-groups on the defensive. Treasuries mixed with curve steepening after yields fell to lowest level in nearly two weeks. Dollar little changed vs euro and yen. Gold finished down 0.1%. WTI crude settled up 0.7%.
   * Market once again devoid of meaningful directional drivers. Recent focus has been on reopening momentum, the moving pieces surrounding infrastructure stimulus, the debate about the market's ability to withstand a higher rate backdrop and rotations. FOMC minutes this afternoon seemed to be a non-event and Q1 earnings season increasingly seen as the next big macro catalyst. Street looking for nearly 25% growth in S&P earnings with upside risk stemming from the usual suspects and green shoots, supply constraints, input cost pressures, pricing power and wallet share shifts likely to be big conference call themes.
   * **FOMC minutes** reiterated Fed mantra it will be some time before substantial further progress is made on goals. Still an outsized focus on **infrastructure stimulus**, particularly in terms of taxes. **Yellen said White House plan tilts scales in favor of companies that invest in US** in WSJ op-ed. Commerce Secretary Raimondo said there is **room to compromise on White House proposal to raise corporate tax rate to 28%.** Politico reported **corporate America doesn't like infrastructure plan given tax changes**. JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said **US economic boom could easily extend into 2023**. Sell-side firms continue to highlight **economic reopening momentum**.
   * Not much corporate news. Cruiseline names **CCL**, **RCL** and **NCLH** helped by CDC reopening comments. **RPM** beat but also discussed significant input price inflation ahead. **LW** missed and flagged supply chain disruptions but did note positive impacts from easing coronavirus restrictions. **MSM** revenue a bit below though commentary was upbeat. **BB** boosted by QNX win at Volvo. **SGH** beat and guided above. **SCHN** beat on strong metals demand and ASP tailwind. **MAXN** guided below on supply chain pressures. **GEO** suspended quarterly dividend payments.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Growth groups ahead with communication services, tech the leaders:**
      * Growth groups extended the week's outperformance against value. **Communication services** the leader as internet names led. **Tech** ahead with upside from AAPL and services, though semis didn't do much. **Energy** an outperformer as integrated oil, E&Ps recouped some of yesterday's declines. **Financials** ahead with moneycenter banks, pockets of insurance among the better groups. **Consumer discretionary** an underperformer with homebuilders, auto complex weaker. **Consumer staples** lower on weakness across food, discount retailers. **Healthcare** trailed on weakness across biotech, life sciences, and hospitals. **Industrials** an underperformer as A&D and airlines traded lower. **Materials** the worst performer on weakness across chemicals.
   * **No surprises from March FOMC minutes:**
      * The [minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210317.pdf) of the FOMC's March 16-17 meeting (which saw no policy changes) broke very little new ground and did little to illustrate any large divide within the committee or anything notable about the timing of removing any accommodation. Participants were upbeat on the accelerating economic recovery and better Covid vaccine and case trends, though some voiced concerns that highly accommodative financial conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking and building financial imbalances. Members generally anticipated nearer-term inflationary pressures would be transitory, though there was also some attention to rising market-based inflation measures. Participants agreed that the economy remained far from the Fed's longer-run goals and that current guidance for rates and asset purchases was serving the economy well. A number emphasized the importance of clear communications well in advance of any policy moves.
   * **Infrastructure stimulus headlines continue to shift toward taxes:**
      * Taxes continue to get the bulk of the attention when it comes to infrastructure stimulus given implications for both reconciliation and earnings. Fed Chair Yellen said in a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-corporate-tax-for-america-11617813355?mod=hp_opin_pos_1) op-ed today that the White House tax plan will tilt scales in favor of companies that invest in the US, boost competitiveness of US business and help end global race to the bottom. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/06/corporate-america-biden-infrastructure-plan-479490) earlier discussed how despite its longstanding call for infrastructure spending, corporate America does not like the White House plan. Highlighted worries about raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% without restoring deductions scrapped in the 2017 overhaul. Global minimum tax flagged as potentially the biggest area of concern. However, Commerce Secretary Raimondo today suggested there is room to compromise White House plan to raise corporate tax rate to 28% ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-taxes/commerce-chief-raimondo-says-there-is-room-for-compromise-on-biden-tax-proposal-idUSKBN2BU2P9)).
   * **Fedspeak includes more commentary on patient stance amid pandemic recovery:**
      * **Chicago Fed President Evans** (voter) said the Fed's employment target will be in sight before too long, achieving the inflation goal will be more difficult ([speech](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/speeches/2021/promising-outlook-opportunity-community-colleges)); the bar for reducing asset purchases won't be met for a long time. **Dallas' Kaplan** (non-voter) said the Fed would not act as pre-emptively on inflation as it has in the past, but he doesn't want the Fed to fall behind the curve on policy. Kaplan also earlier told [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-says-the-economy-still-needs-central-bank-support-11617787800) the economy still currently needs Fed support, but it will be healthier accommodation is removed as the economy recovers. **Richmond's Barkin** (voter) said evidence of inflation pressures are starting to build, and supply chin constrains are now the biggest economic risk. **San Francisco's Daly** (voter) said bold policy steps would help limit COVID scarring, and that the Fed balance sheet is far from hitting any limits ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-daly/feds-balance-sheet-size-is-far-from-hitting-any-constraints-daly-idUSKBN2BU2XG)). **Fed Governor Brainard** said on CNBC the outlook has brightened though reiterated remaining slack and that inflation impulse is likely temporary.

mmz7sm,gtujia4,stocks,comment,1617911136,"I think you may need to step back a bit and have a look at your investing mindset and goals. 

That -50% has happened, it's done. Selling it and forgetting the shame/ deleting the big red numbers on the screen doesn't help you in any way in of itself. I might have grabbed the wrong end of the stick hear so apologies if that's so but you have to get over it and look unemotionally at the future moves if you are to learn from it.
For instance, personally I've been adding most to positions I have which are currently -40 and -60% because I still love what they're trying to do and they've just been hammered by wider market moves. I probably bought a little expensive admittedly but I believe the price is so good that I get a great opportunity to buy lots more. However there have been multiple others where I've gone 'yup that was dumb, I got suckered in to the hype/rally/gains/herd' and I've had to admit I was stupid and try to regain composure and perspective.

 To actually (not) answer your question instead of blithering on... 
Quick and simple test. Imagine you have no history with the stock, forget it ever existed. Now re evaluate it fresh based on your current metrics/ it's current outlook. Does it look like good value at the price it currently is with all the potential/ risk that is has?
Your risk profile is yours alone, there are as many answers to 'individual stock or broad based etf?' as there are investors. Truth is you can't make it a binary question so try not to. Broadbase ETFs are never going to be the wrong choice, by definition they are the safest exposure to pure securities. They just might not be THE best choice. Perhaps reduce the position, sell 25\50% or some portion now to appease yourself and move it if that makes you feel more comfortable and able to feel confident again. Then look again in the coming weeks or months.",

mmy0q2,,stocks,post,1617906116,"Wash Sale (per share) - Different QuestionHey everyone, I know, another tired wash sale question but bear with me, this is at least a little different than the average wash sale question, and probably has an extremely simple answer.

Scenario: buy 10 shares at $32.00, sell at $28.85, realize a loss of $3.15 per share, or $31.50 total.

A few days later, buy 6 shares of the same stock at $32.86. Cost basis of 6 shares is: $32.86 + $3.15 loss per share = $36.01

So here’s the question: when I triggered the wash sale and re-bought 6 shares, only $18.90 of the total $31.50 loss was allocated to the 6 shares (because I only bought 6 and not 10). What happens to the loss from the other 4 shares of $12.60? I would think that:

1) if I buy 4 new shares of this stock in less than 30 days from original sale, it’ll add to the cost of them.
2) or, if I buy no more of this stock, and assume I sell my new 6 shares at a gain, the $12.60 can be used as a true loss to help offset.
3) if I don’t do any other trading with this stock or other similar company stocks, the $12.60 loss would simply help negate other gains in my portfolio?",

mmcpqo,,stocks,post,1617831715,"The Green Correction: Some HypothesesI've been watching since mid-February as green energy stocks (for me, mostly solar and microgrids) have tumbled. I will broaden this out to green stocks in general (throw in EVs) in general, but wanted to get opinions on which of the following hypotheses could explain it:

1. Speculation Bubble: None of the green stocks have realistic valuations, and are falling back to their value. 
2. GameStop Black Hole: A lot of the growth in green stocks was from retail, which is now increasingly drawn to meme stocks instead. 
3. Interest Rates: The rise of 10 year bond interest rate is increasing the cost of loans, and eating into the expected profitability of green companies
4. Politics: As green energy becomes a partisan political issue, it is becoming a mood indicator for liberal policies in general

I am long term optimistic about green energy, particularly with [solar and wind being cost-competitive (and in most cases cheaper) than fossil fuels](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). I don't need the money now, so currently just suffering through compounding red days.

mmbvdt,,stocks,post,1617829273,"$AGTC has me seeing green with their upside potentialI want to make a case for $AGTC, a biotech that is researching a cure to a rare macular disease that affects my son.  I will not pretend to know a darn thing about the inner workings of their research but from what I’ve read it’s very promising for him and millions of other people. 

AGTC is sitting around $4.50 with an average price target of $16 and a high of $35.  According to yahoo finance it has a 1.7 strong buy rating. Their last 3 upgrades were to buy. 

Why this isn’t your typical biotech... let’s look at the numbers:

There are only 42.75 million shares outstanding with a 36.27 million float. Insider percentage is only .66%. So they aren’t some biotech that is diluting their shares to death while waiting for the FDA to move.  Short % has nearly doubled with their short bursts of price increases (it peaked around $9 when it was added to some ETF’s and issued shares in Feb) for 1.63 million shares to 2.8m or 6.65% of float.  

Total debt from recent quarter: $14.3 million - remarkable for a small biotech

Other positives:

They are in a research agreement with Bionic Sight to produce therapies and treatments for the blind and those with severe retinal diseases. Should this be successful AGTC has an exclusive to acquire a majority stake Bionic Sight

They have collaboration agreements with the University of Florida

They generate revenue from non-profit orgs for patient/candidates and receive federal research dollars

Seven out of 10 of their executives are Doctors

They tout their intellectual property portfolio in every filing

One of their offerings (XLRP) is in dual phase 1/2 and 2/3 trials and upon approval they think it could fund their other offerings without relying on private equity and debt. 

Risks:

As with any biotech they may never become profitable.

They will need more funding until XLRP gets FDA approval.  The latest filing says they will pursue all avenues. They just issued 16.7 million shares at ironically, today’s closing price back in February. The stock actually took off on that offering. 

As with every Biotech they could fail their trials. My counter to this is they don’t have all of their eggs in one basket. 

The timeline is long. They expect key results in 2022 and 2023 but say they will continue to present their data at investor conferences and biotech conventions to gin up interest and investment. 

My position:

7500 shares at $4.18. Didn’t consider selling at $9 per share because like I said before, this is personal. I’d love to see them get a breakthrough and fix my son’s eye.  I sold my NVTA profits in Feb (bought in at $11, sold at $52), another genetics company to buy into this one. 

TL;DR:  AGTC is a strong upside speculative biotech with several offerings in the pipeline, strong buy ratings, not terribly diluted, and isn’t in debt up to their eyeballs (pun intended)

mmc289,,stocks,post,1617829808,"Brk.b - strong yield with a fortress businessI have been looking back at my investments over the last 2 years and saw that my initial Berkshire buy is up 30%. I bought on 8/5/2019 - $199.60. 

This was a reminder of why I bought Berkshire. The stock is built like a fortress. Layers of successful businesses in their own rights (Geico, Duracell, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Helzberg, etc), a healthy stock portfolio and a pile of cash ready to be deployed. While I bought the stock largely as a hedge against big stock downturns, it is a growing behemoth in its own right. 

BRK.B bottomed out last year just under $170, which for me represented a ~15% loss. Much better than any of my other stocks did during the covid crash. So it held the line as I wanted and expected.

But realizing that it’s returned a 30% gain to me in some 20 months is fairly impressive. I think this shows there is real money to be made in safety/hedging plays and that stability can go hand in hand with growth.

](https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/)

Background excerpt on V2G:

> The technology is often referred to as “vehicle-to-grid.”

> An electric vehicle with bidirectional charging capacity can send power pack into the grid, or a home, or even another electric vehicle.

Competition:

> The Nissan Leaf is the most popular EV with the capacity, but that’s about it.

> However, there are many new EVs coming with the capacity. The new Hyundai Ioniq 5 is equipped with the technology, and Tesla has commented that all future vehicles will be equipped with bidirectional charging capacity.

Translation of Handelsblatt excerpt:

> “The test vehicles are running, we are in the last pulls with the preparations,” confirms VW Development Board Member Thomas Ulbrich in an interview with the Handelsblatt. From 2022 onwards, **every electric car from the Volkswagen Group that is developed on the basis of the MEB** (“modular electrification kit”) electrical platform can not only charge the electricity but also return it to the grid. In addition to VW, the MEB is also used by the sister brands Audi , Skoda and Seat-Cupra.

Commentary elsewhere:

https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/

> Carmakers that dive into the business of smoothing the grid would benefit more than financially, also. By saving unused renewable energy for future use to feed into the power grid, the vehicle industry would also acquire knowledge of how much storage capacity would actually be available at certain times.

> **For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.**",['TSLA']

If the fund is actively managed there will be people doing a bunch of analysis trying to pick the best companies to invest in. If the fund is passively managed, the fund will simply buy stocks that are in an index (for example the S&P500). Since the actively managed fund has to pay a bunch of people to do analysis, they are more expensive than passive index funds. Each mutual fund will have it's own stock ticker, for example the Fidelity US Total Market Index mutual fund is FZROX. But mutual funds have this weird thing where they can only be bought or sold at the end of the day, that's where ETFs come in.

ETFs are exactly the same as mutual funds except that they are traded like stocks, ETF stands for Exchange-Traded-Funds, they are mutual funds that are traded like stocks on a stock exchange. If you are holding long term there is basically no difference between ETFs and mutual funds.

Under his plan, the New York state Lottery would issue requests for proposals from only a few mobile betting operators, which it could then license out to other sportsbook operators.

This is somewhat different from how other states run online sports betting. States like Pennsylvania and New Jersey allow for several casinos to legally operate, forcing higher competition for customers.

In this case the state runs the lottery and the state gets the revenue. Stocks like DKNG up 2.52% after hours, MGM 1.13% AH, PENN 1.1% AH.

ELS and SUI are incredibly similar and it's difficult to pick one or the other. UMH pays the highest yield and even though it's growing FFO/Share the payout ratio is so high that it can't grow it, maybe just keep it at the same level.

mmfakw,gtr292e,stocks,comment,1617840573,"I own a large position in ELS, though like you said it’s hard to pick between the two. I invested in ELS because they’ve been more thoughtful regarding financing via debt and equity dilution. SUI has been ultra-aggressive in terms of equity dilution to expand into marinas; as they trade at a premium to NAV, it makes sense if the acquisitions are accretive which I believe they are. So even as the shareholders are diluted it’s been a net positive for them. However, I personally believe although marinas may be similar to MH parks in terms of market characteristics, the environmental risk is pretty big. That’s a big question mark for me though I see that there’s huge boat demand. 

Where I’m going with this is, SUI has been aggressively acquiring accretive assets which has been fantastic for shareholders. If those don’t pan out going forward, or they start trading at a discount to NAV due to a long term bear market or just a general change in sentiment, then the market solution and growth strategy starts looking a lot worse. ELS seems more conservative from that standpoint to me, and they are diversified into marinas and RV parks as well just not as aggressively so. They’ve been balanced in their equity dilution and tend to be diligent about paying back debt as they borrow more, so on the whole it’s pretty consistent year over year. I would like to see them be slightly more aggressive in terms of selling shares if they believe they have found very accretive assets, but I think it’s almost better to ask them to dial it up than to ask SUI to dial it down if you’re trying to plan for all market conditions going forward.",

Those companies make a profit from these plans, however I don't know how much the expansion would transition employer coverage to the ACA plans which would be less profitable. Bottom line is that these large insurers still make money from ACA expansion and employer plans are likely to persist. I see ACA expansion as improving revenue for the insurers but a transition from fee for service to outcome based would potentially hurt the majority of establishes healthcare companies whether it's pharma or insurance or medical devices.

Many sites like Stocktwits and Finviz have charts to show you what’s being talked about and being watched and trending but I find it hard to see how that information can be used in a reliable fashion. It seems common that companies on these lists rally for a day or two after being added to the list, but it also seems common that they’re on the list because they’re currently crashing after a rally and the sentiment is filled with a combination of both bears and people looking to pick the stock up cheap because they think it’s a good value. 

My questions for you are 1) why or why not do you see social sentiment as a good indicator to base a trade on? And 2) if you do use it as an indicator, what other factors do you begin to look at to further determine it’s a trade you want to enter?

There must be people out there making money off this momentum, and I find it interesting that the more mainstream retail trading be comes, the stronger of an indicator social sentiment becomes.

mlvi50,,stocks,post,1617774940,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIOHey again everyone,

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)","['TWTR', 'TSLA', 'IR']"

Back in the summer of 2018 I had a goal of selling one Reformation dress I didn't mean to buy at one of their sample sales. I knew about poshmark and depop but for whatever reason I can't recall now, I chose to list it on Poshmark. (Maybe it was the fact they took care of shipping, whereas with depop it was up to the buyer/seller to coordinate shipping labels and that aspect will completely turn me off even if it means I'm making money) Long story short, not only did I sell this dress I hated, I made more money than I bought it for. I started listing more random things I could find in my closet that I didn't like anymore, and at this point I've ""made"" about $3,500 from passive selling. I do have *a lot* of clothes but this is in no way a business for me, just a means of getting rid of unwanted clothes. I never thought I would be using this app long-term like this, I don't even care for the ""social"" aspects of it but goddamn, it works. When I spend time (usually while watching TV) ""sharing"" other peoples' listings, and they in turn share mine, my sales go up. I can't explain it but clearly something is working here.

When I talk to friends who are more interested in the fashion scene than I am, they say depop is definitely the cooler app, esp among Gen z. (we're millennials) At this point, I have about 300 listings in my poshmark closet, and I've been doing just fine, and won't be switching. (this is from the sellers' perspective, obviously as a buyer you can jump around from app to app no problem) I think there is a space for many reselling platforms, and I certainly don't think poshmark is going anywhere anytime soon esp with the infrastructure they've built. I think poshmark should incentive sellers to become buyers on their platform, say, instead of taking a 20% cut for me to cash in my sales, they take a 15% cut and turn my sale money into ""poshmark bucks"" or credit or what have you. 

When I read financial analysts' comments on $posh and they say things like ""why wouldn't you just use Ebay or Facebook Marketplace"" for me personally, I've don't shop for clothes on ebay. about 5 years ago, there was a pair of Frye boots I wanted that were sold out everywhere and eventually I found them on ebay and did buy them but I remember thinking it was weird to buy clothes/shoes on ebay. i think of ebay for tools and antiques, not clothes. and fb marketplace? am I supposed to drive 1.5 hours to the town over to pick up a top I like from some girl selling it maybe $20 less than I could get it in the store? no thanks. clearly these analysts don't understand this app

Anyway, I'm basically brand new to investing, I have about 55 shares of POSH at the moment, I bought in when I thought there was a dip at like $65, clearly it kept dipping so I've been able to average down to $46/share. I'm going to wait till it dips below $40 again to get more. I don't really understand how shorting works, I see the chart, but it cuts off at the end of March.

Stocks traded roughly flat Tuesday, putting a pause on the recent record-breaking rally. Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies' first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that's actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that's taking the market higher. And I don't think we're done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you're going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.""

The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. .

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. . (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income, )

[https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback)  


The average price level dropped sharply during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and has gradually recovered since then. As a result, annual inflation has remained low:

* The 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index reached 0.5% in April 2020, its smallest increase that year.
* Core PCE inflation (which excludes food and energy) registered 0.9% in the same month.

Since then, both measures have remained well below the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual inflation target.

## Recent Trends in Inflation

By January, both PCE and core PCE price indexes were back to their pre-COVID-19 trends. This suggests an interesting exercise: Assuming prices remain on trend, what will inflation be in 2021? We can think of this exercise as informing us of the “mechanical” inflation resulting from things returning to normal.

The figure below shows actual PCE inflation and projected inflation for the remainder of the year.[1](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) I projected inflation by taking the PCE price index from 2015 to 2019 and projecting it onward, and then calculated future inflation as the growth rate between the projected index and the *actual* price index from 12 months prior.



https://imgur.com/a/aLQydnj

As we can see, these estimates project annual inflation above 2% for three months (March, April and May) and converging back to the pre-pandemic average towards the end of the year.

Given the new framework for monetary policy adopted last August, this temporary and mild rise of inflation would be consistent with the Fed’s objective, stated as “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”[2](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) In other words, we should not expect the Fed to react to this temporary rise in inflation.

## Inflation Hints from Other Macroeconomic Variables

The exercise I conducted assumes prices will follow their pre-pandemic trend. However, the pandemic and the policies implemented to combat it have significantly altered the economic landscape. Might these changes imply even higher inflation?

The following series of figures display several key macroeconomic variables, which articulate various views on inflation. All these variables suggest the presence of further inflationary pressures.

### Inflation Expectations

We can think of inflation as a self-fulfilling prophecy where actual inflation depends on expected inflation. This view is shared by many central banks to explain long-run inflation. In this view, a successful central bank anchors inflation expectations around its target for inflation. The figure below shows one measure of expected inflation: the difference in the annual yields of five-year Treasury notes and five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).[3](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/BO7JvJ8

According to this measure, expectations about future inflation have been rapidly accelerating. This may be due in part to the adoption of the new monetary policy framework, as the market now understands that the Fed will let inflation temporarily rise above a 2% annual rate to make up for lost ground. However, it is a variable that deserves close monitoring, especially if it goes significantly above the Fed’s target.

### Unemployment

The so-called Phillips curve states a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The theory—popular among central banks—leads one to expect higher (lower) inflation as the economy strengthens (weakens). As such, it is mostly used to explain cyclical variations in inflation around some long-run value.

The next figure shows two measures of unemployment:

* The official unemployment rate
* The U-6 rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force or employed part time for economic reasons



https://imgur.com/a/UEXkJyo

Both measures have recovered significantly but remain elevated relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. If the economy continues its strong recovery, unemployment is expected to fall even further, which would imply inflationary pressures.

Note, however, that the empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment has diminished significantly in recent years—if not altogether disappeared—and may not be relevant for the current episode, just as it was not during the previous recession.[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)

### Monetary Aggregates

Monetarism is the theory that relates the price level to some monetary aggregate (e.g., currency) and inflation to the growth rate of monetary aggregates. In a modern economy, currency accounts for a small fraction of transactions, so economists look at “broader” monetary aggregates. The figure below shows two such aggregates (M2 and MZM), which both grew significantly between February and May 2020.[5](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/S3t7vhG

These increases coincided with the rise in personal savings during the same period, as households not only received substantial transfers from the federal government but also found it difficult to spend as they normally would.[6](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) These additional savings likely imply a surge in the demand for goods and services as the economy returns back to normal, which would put upward pressure on prices.

How much prices increase due to this pent-up demand will also depend on how nimble supply is, and there are good reasons to believe that the recovery in supply may trail demand. Regardless, as evidenced in the chart, this channel would likely have a temporary (rather than permanent) effect on inflation.

### Federal Debt

Various theories link prices or inflation to the level of debt and expected future fiscal surpluses. Though their mechanisms vary, they all predict higher prices or inflation as debt rises. The final figure shows the federal debt in the hands of the public (net of Fed holdings), which rose significantly between March and June 2020.



https://imgur.com/a/LHUcqH4

As with monetary aggregates, debt increased sharply in level, but its growth rate afterward remains roughly the same. As such, the effects, if any, will materialize as a temporary increase in inflation. However, note that current projections estimate deficits to remain large and growing as a fraction of the economy.[7](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) This trend may put additional pressures on future inflation.

## Conclusion

In the coming months, it is likely that inflation will rise above 2% on an annual basis for a few months. We should neither be surprised nor expect the Fed to react.

However, several reasons point to further inflationary pressures. If these pressures materialize and prove persistent, the Fed will have to eventually step in to lower inflation and achieve its goal of 2% average inflation.

On the other hand, inflation may fail to materialize—as it has in the past—and instead return to its pre-pandemic average. In such a case, the Fed will face a choice: either continue to tolerate persistently undershooting its own target or adopt policies to deliberately raise inflation.

Until then equity markets are going to keep riding the wave of volatility. My biggest fear is how lending practices have been loosened in concurrence with longterm high inflation.

Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it’s not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn’t expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week’s 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed.   Sanitizer shortages, same thing.  

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume.  Any ideas on why the small price action?
Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   


This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.  


Edit update:
Open options interest for this week are trending 100% bullish sentiment

Today they announced a new marshmallow snack for grab and go has station type purchases.    Marshmallow is one of the highest profit margins of any food products.

mminfh,,investing,post,1617851206,"LARK seems like a good buyThis small regional bank has some nice things going for it. They’ve consistantly grown their business over the years. They’ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which won’t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition. It was one thing that worried me and caused me to email their investor relations, but fidelity just has a bad newsfeed because the company is so small.",

mminfh,gtroxhn,investing,comment,1617852316,"Interesting and impressive for a micro-cap company.

1. Revenue and profit have been growing for the last 5 years. Even during a pandemic.
2. Free cash flow has been growing for the last 5 years, too. 
3. Net Margin is high, not sure if this is normal for bank industry.
4. Still paying a good % of dividends
5. They're paying down debts while positive in cashflow
6. Equity has been consistently and slowly growing
7. PE ratio at 6.40

Its 5-yr Av. FCF x 15 (conservative number) = **$186M**

And it''s currently being traded at **$124M** marketcap.

I like buying stock based on its free cash flow and this is a strong signal for me that they're undervalued, as long they have a healthy balance sheet.

The only thing that I don't like here is they keep issuing more shares, not crazy but slowly, which is normal for a micro-cap company. However, I stumbled down a post they started buying back their shares last year.

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/LARK.P/key-development](https://www.reuters.com/companies/LARK.P/key-developments)  
*""Landmark Bancorp Board Approves Stock Repurchase Program Of Up To An Aggregate Of 225,890 Shares Of Co""*

Based on its TTM Cashflow statement, they just bought $2,000,000 worth of shares.

I love a stock when they consider buying back their shares, imagine for a micro-cap company, because it's definitely a good sign that they value their shareholders. I love this practice from companies that are publicly traded.

I think I have enough signals to start a <1% position in my portfolio and just watch. I'll be cost-average if they're doing great. I think there's upside potential on this stock and have room to grow from acquisitions but I'm buying from its current cash flow at the moment.

Free cash flow is positive but it’s always worth paying attention to the Balance Sheet when it comes to banks (which is never that straight forward given the varying degrees of regulatory capital required), personally I like to have a decent buffer of Net Book Value v Market Cap as in a liquidation scenario the costs to collect/sell assets are going to eat into this buffer.

I'm just an average FP&A guy, not a superstar by any means... but what immediately stuck out to me in two seconds of looking at their financials is that the industry's Loan Loss Provision is 2.5 times that of LARK's, and on a micro cap, one small wave of defaults could put this company immediately underwater.

Consider that when BOA acquired Countrywide they discovered that a full third of Countrywide's loans were in default.  Countrywide's acquisition price was 2000 times larger than LARK's market cap.

I've got 20 years of experience in financial and data analytics, and even I don't feel confident in my valuation of banks because once you start getting into Level 2 and Level 3 assets, the valuations are so complicated that even some folks at Goldman couldn't tell you with accuracy what the bank is worth.

Some highlights: 

[Dimon's discussion of corporate citizenship](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#corporate-citizen)

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

>1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

mm65gx,gtqacmj,investing,comment,1617827158,"Really interesting passage here from Dimon w.r.t post 2008 banking regulation and it's impact on loans:

> To understand this in more specific terms, look at the chart above that shows, prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had $13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending (this is, in part, directly related to the new liquidity requirements) may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experienced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more had been lent, the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been faster. 

I haven't heard this brought up before but it's something worth considering.

Also regarding QE and deficit spending:

> If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quantitative easing (QE) and deficit spending averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period after the Great Recession did not result in higher GDP growth and possibly higher inflation. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 4%, which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%.

> And so why did all this QE not have the effect you would have thought? QE was never effectively tried prior to the Great Recession, and it is different from fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securities from security holders who tend to reinvest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset prices and creates some spending (through the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may have some inflationary effects, mostly on asset prices. But on the other hand, it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves, which is an input cost for businesses, and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement income). And finally, in this most recent round of QE, much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back as deposits at the Fed, not as loans.

Just in case anyone needed another explanation of why we aren't seeing massive amounts of inflation. 

In general there's a ton of good stuff in there, the COVID-19 section in particular regarding possible scenarios going forward, risks and some insight into the kind of acute liquidity events that cropped up last year and why we might be seeing them more frequently.",
mm65gx,gtpj41v,investing,comment,1617815487,"I know that coming from Jamie Dimon, who heads one of the largest global banks, calling for increased regulation for fintech sounds pretty self-interested. But I kind of feel like he is right. We've already seen, over and over, what kind of damage banks can do when we leave them to their own devices--and that is with regulation. But an increasing amount of systemic risk is now taking place outside of those regulations.

Take a recent topic of a lot of discussion: Coinbase. As of their December reporting, they had over 90B of customer assets, which would have put them in the top 40 banks. I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

mm9ppe,,investing,post,1617823242,"Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sourcesBy Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.","['XOM', 'MS', 'AES']"

mmg62o,,investing,post,1617842616,"$BAOS - Baosheng Media - Recent IPO Play Extremely Undervalued and Primed to Make Moves in 2021**Background:**

Baosheng Media Group is a Chinese Online Marketing solution provider. It's main business model is connecting advertisers to online media. Managing marketing activities, advertising strategies, budgets, and ad optimization services.

**Growth:**

Baosheng Media Group has been steadily growing revenues seeing year over year increases from 2018 to 2019 of 10.5% from $16.16 million to $17.85 million. Securing long term contracts with many media moguls such as: Tiktok, Amazon, Ctrip, 360 finance and Youku.

**Future Growth:**

$BAOS ipo'ed in early February 2021, offering 6 million shares at a IPO price of $5 a share. Raising $30 million in proceeds which will be used for expanding the Company's business scale and building its network of leaders/acquiring employees.

China's digital marketing spending is rapidly growing, with 2021 forecasts expected to increase 20% from 2020. With expected annual growth of above 20% as companies are looking to more short-form video ads and social media ads.

$BAOS is looking to capitalize on this growth by utilizing funds to enter into new sections such as NFT marketing and into the crypto currency field. BAOS received backing and a $10million investment from Ebang $EBON in late March to develop a blockchain-based platform/NFT and crypto currency platform.

BAOS is looking to create a platform to buy and sell NFT related work and enter an exploding market. NFT's market cap grew 1785% from 2020 in early 2021 due to the NFT craze. With China leading the market in dollar volume and spending.

**Margins and Ratios: (competitor valuations)**

BAOS is a market leader when it comes to profitability and margins.

BAOS reported 9.5m and 11.16m in pretax income in 2018 and 2019.

Those are margins of 58.7% and 62.5% respectively for their years.

Return on equity: 43.2% vs market average of 4.78%

Return on assets: 13.27% vs market average of 1.27%

Their bottom line has been steadily improving year over year through developing efficiencies and capitalizing on market trends.

**BAOS:**

Market Cap: 172M

Revenue: 17.8M

Earnings per share of 0.4

Price to earnings of: 14.72

Net profit: 10.8M

Cash on Hand: 51M

**SRAX:**

Market Cap:115M

Earnings per share of (0.69)

Price to earnings: N/A

Revenues: 8.6M

Net Loss: (14.6M)

Cash on Hand:9M

**IZEA:**

Market Cap: 270M

Revenue: 18.3M

Earnings per share of (0.248)

Net Loss: (10.2M)

Cash on hand: 33M

**Comparatives;**

As you can see BAOS is deeply undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few small cap marketing companies that are operating at a profit (62.5%) at that aswell. It also has the strongest balance sheet and cash balance among its peers.

**Cash Position:**

BAOS is flush with cash and there is no threat of any share dilutions/offerings. BAOS is sitting on over 51 million in cash. Broken out by 11Million in cash pre IPO, 30Million from IPO proceeds and another 10 million received from EBON.

BAOS is cash flow positive with cash from operations each year in excess of 9M annually, further increasing its cash position.

BAOS will be looking to utilize this cash to grow its business through acquisitions, new infrastructure such as NFT platforms and acquiring talented individuals.

**Public Float:**

Baos has one of the smaller active tradeable floats on the market. The initial offering only issued 6 million shares of BAOS with many of these shares being locked up until August.

The stock is largely unknown with volumes being very scarce. This is causing significant bid/ask spreads upwards of 3-4%. This also means there is very few walls for when this gains momentum.

**China Low Float Recent IPO Trend**

Chinese low float stocks have been getting pumped across the markets lately. Many of which have been recent IPO's due to their share lock up periods further reducing the floats.

Some prime examples include:

$EEIQ running form $3.58 to $35.20 in 2 days

$UTME running from $4 to $107 in 2 days

$WAFU running from $4 to $21 in 2 days.

$BAOS meets all the above criteria, with a small float, small market cap and in a hot sector. NFT/Crypto

**Upcoming Press Releases:**

I am expecting a press release to be issued in the next week or two regarding the demo/roll out of their NFT platform.

BAOS's first press release was issued on March 18th regarding the EBON collaboration and entry into the NFT field. This was the first day the company could release news due to its 40day quiet period after a IPO. EBON stated in early February it was looking to enter the NFT field. I expect the partnership was entered in early to mid February. Meaning a news release on the development of the platform for BAOS should be right around the corner.

NFT press releases have cause stocks to skyrocket, and was the hottest sector in March. With stocks such as TKAT, HOFV, DLPN and WKEY gaining as much as 1000%. These stocks have cooled off but most are still trading at 2.5-5x their pre press release values.

The market has cooled off since March but I do expect a large movement the day the PR comes out due to the thin walls and small public float.

**Summary/Price target**

BAOS is a unknown hidden gem. The cash obtained through IPO and Ebon investment will help it improve/expand its infrastructure and significantly grow the business. BAOS is already experiencing over 10% annual growth and these numbers will explode in 2021 thanks to China's online marketing spending growth of 20% + in 2021 combined with BAOS entering into the NFT market which grew 1785% from 2020. BAOS is sitting on over 51m in cash and there is no risk of share offerings due to its cash flow from operations exceeding 9m a year. BAOS is a market leader when it comes to cost minimization and profit margins, experiencing over 62% margins in 2019. BAOS is unknown to many and is not getting the traction is deserves, the first press release will send this flying thanks to its bid/ask spread and being in the NFT sector. BAOS is undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few profitable marketing small cap companies and is sitting on a boat load of cash.

PT Short Term (May): 10$ after the press release relating to the release of its NFT platform. This would make it the similar market cap as IZEA, while BAOS has substantially more cash and is reporting 11m in net income vs Izea's 10M losses.

PT Long Term 2022: $25

I expect revenues to climb 30% + in 2021 thanks to China market growth and entering new NFT fields combined with purchasing/acquiring new infrastructure and talent. BAOS is still being valued as a marketing company (undervalued) and has not capture any of the NFT/Crypto attention.

EDIT: This post is getting some backlash because this subreddit is anti-chinese plays. I am not advocating to toss 100% of your portfolio on this stock. Allocate a small portion and diversify your holdings. This stock is trading at its IPO price and has limited downside thanks to its cash position. Enter with a small portion and set a stop loss to test the waters. This stock is unknown due to the lack of PR's as it just got out of its quiet period. The upcoming PR about its NFT platform will attract new investors and make this rally. Feel free to sell at a gain once it does so or set a stop loss at your initial investment price and ride it out. Dismissing all Chinese investments is a awful investment strategy.

I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

**VW** has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, [Frank Walliser](https://presskit.porsche.de/motorsport/en/mediaguide-2017/topic/gt-programs/porsche-gt-team/info/driver/dr-frank-steffen-walliser-porsche-gt-team-wec-gt-2017.html), at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

VW got a head start over most of their competition because of ""DieselGate"" scandal - when that all blew up they pulled some future ICE projects and went all-in on EV development, starting back in.  Also, some of the penalties they had to pay for DieselGate went towards developing EV charging stations (which can now help their EV sales.  Oh no, such punishment...)

Their bread and butter EV model, the Rav4-sized ID4, will be manufactured on *3 continents* and sold all over the globe.  They have a partnership with QS, with intentions to produce *solid state batteries in 4-5 years*, which could be a significant jump on the competition.

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith & Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. 

Right now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.","['BLK', 'AMZN']"

Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming a new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are regulated.

The Crypto Council for Innovation will lobby policy makers, take up research projects and serve as the burgeoning industry’s voice in championing the economic benefits of digital currencies and related technologies. Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

The council’s launch comes as prices of many digital assets have surged, drawing in new mainstream investors and the banks and brokers that serve them. Earlier this year, the total market value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, touched $1 trillion for the first time.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

“Crypto is at a mainstream inflection point,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Paradigm and Coinbase’s former president. “It’s in its very early stages and, much like the internet (once was), it’s very fragile while it’s in that stage.”

The internet emerged as a major force in global commerce in part because of a handful of key policy decisions, including those that legalized data encryption and resolved questions over sales taxes, Mr. Ehrsam said. The nascent cryptocurrency market is sure to face its own crossroads, even if it isn’t yet obvious what they are, he said.

“It’s challenging because policy makers want to balance risk and reward, and even people who spend time in this space would struggle to predict where this will go in the coming decade,” he said. “It was very hard to say where the internet was going to go.”

The council plans to appoint a board that would include representatives with each of the four initial members. In time, Mr. Ehrsam said, the group will add an executive team.

Mr. Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang founded Paradigm three years ago to invest in both cryptocurrencies and the companies that focus on that market.

Fidelity, an investing colossus with nearly $10 trillion in client assets under administration, opened in 2018 a custody business that stores and trades bitcoin for hedge funds and other professional investors. Last month, the Boston firm became the latest money manager to seek regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.

Square, an electronic-payments company, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. And the firm’s Cash App consumer-finance platform allows users to buy and sell the digital currency.

Coinbase, founded in 2012, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. The company, which serves 43 million customers in 100 countries, plans to go public later this month.",

mm45l7,,investing,post,1617807980,"Drive Shack, the reopening play you never heard of**General Overview:**

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

**My Holdings**: 150 shares as of right now

**FINAL TLDR:** *The company has a lot of potential for growth. It's worth the effort of looking into them ahead of earnings in early May.*",['IR']

Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

All else being equal there are reasons to believe the excess liquidity sloshing around the system will find its way to risk assets, specifically stocks, before too long. First quarter earnings could change that, but that will be the story for next week.",['CCL']

There are so many tickers I see mentioned on this site, yet I can't invest in all of them unless I have a very small amount in each, which I think defeats the purpose because the returns won't move the portfolio if they are tiny.

I need advice and some serious talk.

I am currently sitting on a portfolio of

\- 45% ETF´s  
\- 40% high dividend stocks and reits and such

rest in individual stocks I picked and liked.

I want more growth as I want to reduce the time I need to get to a certain threshold.

I picked the dividend stocks mainly because of the high yield. the lowest yield I get is 4,5%. highest at 13,4%.

I know that

\- those high yields are probably not lasting forever

\- I miss out on growth of the actual securities

but also , ALL dividend securities are green since I bought them.

the lowest being +1,51% (OMF), the highest being 42,88% (OKE).  
the rest is between 8,7% 27,09% green.

what should I do ? sell at green, take the tax hit (which is about 25% of profits where I live -> germany)  
or keep those titles ?

currently I reinvest every dividend payout I get. but those also take a tax hit. so I am missing out on returns and not even benefitting from the full dividend payout...

I am open for all kinds of tips and suggestions.",['OKE']

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% after hitting a record high of 4,086.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14%, or 46 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.

""Watch the S&P 500 over the next few days for potential consolidation - that benchmark is now very overbought / extended on the short-term trading charts and is likely to see some profit taking ahead in our opinion,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. Initial support is touted in the 3975-to-4000 zone, the firm added.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

""Although we expect near-term volatility as 1Q earnings start on April 14, reflecting weak loan growth, margin pressure, lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonal factors, we remain positive on the bank group,"" Wedbush said.

Technology stocks, were roughly unchanged, with the fab 5 trading mixed, even as falling U.S. bond yields supported investor sentiment on longer-duration growth stocks.  

The U.S. 10-year slipped below 1.7% quote yields after trading in range of 1.67% to 1.72% in recent days. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was higher.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) struggled to get going after racking up a 6% gain on Monday, as investors digested a bearish note from Roth Capital.

Roth Capital said Tesla is only worth $150 a share and suggested the electric automaker was a ""minor player"" in the U.S. and European markets.","['DVN', 'PNC', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA', 'APA', 'DOW', 'AMZN', 'FB', 'BK', 'NDAQ', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'SPGI', 'FANG', 'STT']"

mkzjy4,gtisvs8,investing,comment,1617672980,"I think you're comparing apples to oranges here in a sense. 

First, Real Estate is not a liquid asset like your stocks.  It's something you put into a (likely) minimum 5-10yr time-frame with regards to financial analysis. 

Secondly, you own the entire thing. This is not shares in a company that you have no control over. Your DD on buying a property should be way higher than DD on a stock. You should know the neighborhood and know the risks and be willing to take them.  You should be fiddling with pro-formas constantly to decide if a property works for you. If it doesn't then don't do it.  Also, people forget while there is an advantage to leverage, YOU can decide how much you leverage. If you want to have a 50% leverage to feel safer and have a better cash-flow, then you can. Nothing stops you from doing that. 

RE is a great hedge against inflation. Your cost for money stays static mostly, while inflation goes up and so do your rents and so does the value of your asset. In the same vein you're taking tax breaks on deflation and other expenses. 

Of course your stocks won't call you at 3am on a weeknight letting you know that the water heater has exploded in the garage :) 

Lastly, all your ""what ifs"" apply equally if not more to any stock. What if there's a global pandemic and my airline holdings can't fly anyone. Would you have predicted no one would be watching movies in theaters for 9-12 months? There is inherent risk in any investment, but with RE you're more likely to have a long-term glacial change than rapid fluctuation.",

Weird thing about property, one of the only times banks will loan big money to average Joe.  Real estate makes more millionaires then any industry.  It’s because people can get leverage easily.  The house is collateral.  It’s rare a property drops to $0 or even 50% quickly.  But like any investment, requires you to do your homework.

Don’t buy a cheap single family home in a questionable town that’s supports the coal industry in bumblefuck nowhere with multiple fracking sites within a couple miles.  Then act surprised the town is becoming vacant or there is pollution in the ground water.

Do buy a duplex in a town undergoing gentrification.  It sounds like a joke, but look for where new Micro Breweries are going up.  It’s the trendy shit that puts your town on the map.  You use to look for new McDonald’s or similar franchise growth in small town.  Today it’s micro brews and ChikFilA.  Bonus points if you’re handy or have a construction background.

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.  


&amp;#x200B;

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",['AMP']

ml7dpa,gtl8oep,investing,comment,1617728858," 

My 30-something daughter is just now starting to invest as she has advanced in her career and is making good money. Well, I think she got her first lesson in investing: Don't believe the hype. She bought FPWM at $4-something. Just 100 shares so it wasn't a lot of money, thankfully. I have no idea where she got that ""tip"". I took a look at it but didn't say a word. What was I going to say? That she bought a stock that had hardly been over .60 per share in 5 years for over $4? She talked to me a few times about how much it was going up and she was really pleased. I put it on my watch list just to see what it did.

Well, it got up to $8 per share and then bam... dropped like a rock. The volume that day was WAY above it's average. It's now under $3.

On the brighter side, she did put $5k into VTSAX.",

Premiums are super high. You can go long 100 shares at $31-32, and sell calls with a July expiration and $35 strike for $5+. 

Gives you an effective entry of $26 and allows

Yes, it caps your profits. Yes you’ll miss a short squeeze.

ml5nfg,,investing,post,1617691914,"Playboy - Excitement for you and your wallet (Potential 2-4x) DD on PLBY

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought of NFTs on hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at only fans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style& apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming & lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty & Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style & apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming & Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty & Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast)

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['CHD', 'WMT', 'CVS', 'NKE', 'GPS']"

ml5nfg,gtjulec,investing,comment,1617700769,"Did not know that Playboy was still around.  It appears to be a shadow of its' former self per Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy\_Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Enterprises).    


March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed  - now completely digital.  No more glossy centerfolds.

It also appears that the adults now own & run the business, Hugh Hefner died in 2017 and his daughter who ran the company from 1988 to 2009 are no longer an issue.  It is also apparent that most of the losing enterprises from Heff's day have been dropped.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises’ had merged with Mountain Crest - a SPAC.  


According to Schwab:     
Canaccord Genuity Initiates PLBY Group at Buy Rating With $28 Price Target

Craig-Hallum raises price target to $35 from $25

Roth Capital raises PLBY Group's Price Target to $26 From $18, Keeps Buy Rating

Also up 19% yesterday and 4% After hours.  

If I were to buy into PLBY would have to see what their Asian operations & casino openings slated for the next 3 years are.  And what the former Asian operations financials were before they closed them down.    


As to their brand/product - to be crass the product is a commodity.   Not sure if it has any cache anymore.  As to hawking other brands: "" Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. "".  Every company that can,  works with (pays extortionate rates for) celebrities which is a tried-and true way of doing business.  Also pretty tired method.   If you need a reminder of celebrity abuse and how useless it is: doughy-faced Tom Bosley of Happy Days TV show fame gave a rousing recommendation for a swindlers failed investment scheme. 

*On buying sentiment:*   
PLBY has a former reputation to live down, using celebrities to pitch their brand (at very best neutral rating),  their product is barely distinguishable from other brands,  and ""Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals \[like 50% of the population - women\] – ..... I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women"" - this could be insurmountable.   


Seeing the Penthouse Magazine in its' heyday and what it is now and comparing it to PLBY is kind of the flightplan I see for PLBY.  Went from being misogynistic and vapid to totally vapid.  


***In total - good OP analysis of the positive points but PLBY has some serious perception drawbacks.***  


Think PLBY is a sell for the immediate future not a buy particularly given the runup yesterday and last night.  PLBY is still in their first year of a shakedown cruise  trying to see what works with todays clients.   More distance will have to be put between the past and what they are currently going to do to make money.  Also only time will tell if their new clients gained during the pandemic are sticky or flaky (Jesus that has unintended under/overtones).  The cache of going to a Playboy mansion is dead.  Celebrity endorsement is a big bucket of who cares.  But in 5 years - with a considerable amount of re-branding, some outstanding PR, and dropping of certain lines of business - they could make a go of it.    


But then again, I could be hopelessly out of date.  PLBY could be a total surprise.  For me, it is a pass since it has ""faddish and transitory"" stamped in big letters all over it.  Rather like cigarette stocks; except cigarette stocks pay a dividend.  Maybe PLBY is more of a day trade or swing trade.  Definitely not a buy and hold for me.  


***To the OP: good analysis of the positive side of PLBY.  Think you could very successfully write their promotional material for them.  Look forward to seeing your next DD analysis.  If this post is any indicator you are good at this.***",['BEN']

**NIO** - Known as the ""Tesla of China"" it moves exactly as Tesla does and is looking to trade in the Open Market for China as well as the US, basically a Baby tesla

**FUNKO** - now hear me out, with their recent acquisition of an NFT, i can easily see Funko moving into more of a crypto and long term growth play with a possibility of being bought out by Disney, they have also grown tremendously in the last couple of months

**Coinbase** - IPOing through a directly listing on April 30th, this is kind of an obvious play. They make a SHIT ton of money and are the King broker in Crypto and the most mainstream with their revenue growing from half a million in 2019 to 1.1 Billion in 2020

**RKT** - The biggest mortgage company in the US, expanding into Canada and looking for a fintech category, they are extremely well positioned to start acquiring other companies and start dipping their toes into other sector of the financial market (car loans, Zillow/Redfin Competitors, etc)

**Roblox** - This is strictly here because they are the amazon of gaming. People are able to make money off of Roblox and that makes it a great growth company, really any company that you can make money off of is suitable for huge growth not to mention their insane money spending crowd of kids

**Disney** - hear me out. Expansion coming for disneyland to build two more parks. Their Disney+ series is only going to get better with more marvel and star wars original content and anyone that is a parent knows how good Disney+ is. Also, once everything opens up they will be making money off theaters + their new movie releases on Disney+ to watch from home. I think they have plenty of growth left.

**Apple** - But apple i already the most valuable company how can they possible be considered a *growth* company at these high valuations. Two words for you ""apple car"" and ""Apple glasses""

**Tesla** - for obvious reasons, self driving, insurance for that self driving, more cars, EV charging expansion, all that good stuff

**RIOT** - literally the only reason this is up here is if you think Bitcoin is going to go higher then so is RIOT. in one year it went from $0.70 to highs of $75.....yup, its trading right now at under $50 i think and can easily hit $100+ as long as BTC keeps moving upwards

mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",['TSLA']

The Annual report explains;  COGS comprising, amongst others, approximately $4,773,000 in labor and overhead and underutilized factory capacity and  $2,615,000 in FUV parts from the sale of our vehicles.

They sell the assembled FUV cars with a lower price, than the parts are worth seperate. Then they spend more than  $4.5 mln on labor costs and underutilized factory capacity (they do not blame Covid for this). I have never heard about a growing company with underutilization...

With a cash burn of  $17 mln last year, a desire to grow and ""only""  $33 mln cash on the balance, the company will need to raise money to fund their ambition. This means either dilution or debt (and interest costs).

They do have a pre-order portfolio of less then 5.000 vehicles (retail and commercial), worth around  $100 mln revenue. This does not match with an underutilized factory. And when will they be able to produce efficiently? Plus, if they want to produce 50k units per year from 2022, they better start increasing this portfolio.

I like the vehicles and I do see potential in them, but this stock is hyped and overvalued at this moment together with Ayro and Solo.",

I have a large sum to invest (partly inheritance) ie around 0.5m . I have some experience of investing, but not a lot, and the recent increase in my portfolio means there's now a lot more to lose.

I don't really need the money as income (have other sources), so what I want to do is invest it for long term (30 years or so) and may not touch it before I die, and pass it on. 

I would like to grow it as much as possible, and of course not lose it.

So my thinking is index funds. I have to accept that I am not educated enough in finance, and probably not smart enough to get sufficiently educated, to be able to do successful stock picking, much as I would like to. I also don't trust a third party to manage the money fairly or well (not saying my lack of trust is justified, just that I have it).

So then the question is - which index funds?

Although people often suggest that index investing is a simple activity, I would have thought it matters greatly which index you pick.

So my questions are:

- Should I pick an S&P 500 index, even though the P/E ratio looks very much on the high side?

- Should I pick something like the British FTSE 100, which is thought to be undervalued at the moment? And then maybe come back to S&P 500 later?

- Should I choose an emerging markets ETF?

- Or stay in cash until S&P 500 cools down a bit?


I would certainly want to get more than inflation, and more than bonds would give me. I'm happy to sit through ups and downs, I just feel like the decision I make at this point is going to have long-reaching ramifications on my final portfolio.

It seems that Biden doesn't support full-fledged federal legalization. He seems more interested in federal decriminalization and let the states decide what to do for now. If that is the case, these vertically integrated multistate operators (MSOs) will have get a bigger and bigger market share as time goes on. The sooner federal legalization happens, the sooner they can lose market share to opposition (Canadian companies, big tobacco, etc). But because weed is federally illegal, they can't be listed on the NYSE. Being an OTC stock means less hedge funds and big whales invested in these highly profitable companies. Federal legalization can lead the way for them to up-list. Hopefully seeing a boost. 

So I'm bullish because I don't think we'll see federal legalization in the next year, maybe two. It'll let these companies expand. 

As for Curaleaf, they recently saw their bump because of NY legalizing weed. As well as Green Thumb, Cresco, and many other northeast operators.

mjwo8q,,investing,post,1617544552,"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policiesThe waste industry is more than just hard-working gentlemen and women collecting trash from your home or business. It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth.

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['NOV', 'GOOGL']"

This weekend I went and bought some Plywood for the house. I couldn’t believe how much I had to pay for some simple 2’x4’s.

The price has gone up by 250% in just the last few months. With the housing boom happening and everyone trying to remodel their house I see this continuing on for a while.

Is anyone else noticing this and trying to take advantage of it?


The two lumber stocks I found are Weyerhaeuser(WY) and Rayonier (RYN) both of the stocks are up slightly but don’t seem outrageous in terms of evaluations.

You can see WY doesn’t have a crazy evaluation. It also peaked in 2007 during the last housing boom.

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

mijlje,,investing,post,1617367458,"U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.",

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k).

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality. 

Those continuing to back fossil fuels are equivalent to those who invested in horses and buggies in 1904.  //",['DE']

\>But the biggest winner from the recovery plan could be Canadian oil  sands producers in what could be seen as an ironic twist of fate after  Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline that might have made life easier  for these companies by providing a much needed additional outlet for  their growing oil exports to the southern neighbor. 

\>Asphalt is made from bitumen, and bitumen is what the oil sands  yield. With ambitious targets for new roads and bridges and for  large-scale repair works, asphalt demand in the next few years could  soar.

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

mj2qmk,,investing,post,1617430149,"Drd gold , a vertical growth gold mine(first dd, constructional critism will be welcomed)
disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",
mj2qmk,gt9lulr,investing,comment,1617472924,"I'm not an expert by any means, but maybe I can help you examine this in some more detail because on the surface this does look interesting.

Most of my gold mining knowledge (which is not much) comes from my time working as a land surveyor [in Colorado gold country.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B047'33.2%22N+105%C2%B031'33.3%22W/@39.792556,-105.5281017,700m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d39.7925558!4d-105.5259125) All those piles of brown from there all the way south and west beyond Idaho Springs are tailings, and there's still gold up in them there mountains. From what I understand, this stuff is exactly what this company would be targeting for processing, but currently the tailings in CO are just being sat on until gold reaches a threshold price where the owner will then start processing the tailings at a profit. I don't know what that threshold is but it hasn't happened yet and there hasn't been activity here since the early 1980s.

So my questions, and these are intended to dig a little deeper, maybe think about things from a different angle and stress test your bullish hypothesis, I'm not trying to shit on your DD or anything: 

1.  Are they purely a tailings-processing company now or do they also operate traditional mines? Looks like purely tailings now, but you also mentioned looking at surface mining internationally in the future.
2. What are their current reserves? Do they have enough tailings in SA to keep them busy at current levels until 2023? 2025? 2030? Their plan seems to be focused on SA until 2026 so I'm trying to get at the scale of revenue and earnings growth for the next 5 years here. Basically if they stay in SA the jump they saw in 2020 may plateau once they hit full operating capacity until they scale up internationally.
3. Specifically related to gold tailings, are the tailings in South Africa more concentrated? Or is DRD's process more cost-effective than traditional processing and allows them to profitably process tailings at a lower price of gold? If their process is significantly and demonstrably more cost-effective then that could be a big disruptive factor for the company. If it's just that the tailings in SA are better quality, then I'm more skeptical.
4. What was the investment required to build the processing plant? And if they expand internationally, will they have to build plants locally, work with local companies (sort of leasing their process), or ship the tailings to their SA plant?
5. Has processing platinum tailings begun? If so when did it begin or if not when is it expected to begin?
6. If platinum isn't up and running, there's more risk inherent there in that case. What is the difference between gold tailings and platinum tailings? Is it a similar process (using the same methods and chemicals) or is it significantly different? Can we expect similar margins from this as the gold?
7. What's their competition here? What other companies are in the gold/platinum tailings processing space?

I don't expect you'd have all the answers to these questions, but maybe there's some things there to think about.

In short, I'm intrigued. If their processing is indeed more cost-effective than traditional tailings processing, then long term that's potentially a good sign for big growth and big scaling. That would mean a potential disruptive factor within that industry and would provide a good competitive moat/advantage. If the jump is simply related to getting a plant up and running and processing high-quality trailings, then I'd expect the growth to stabilize once platinum is up and running (if it's not already) and they'd be more vulnerable to competition especially once they start trying to scale internationally.",

* I also used GOOGLEFINANCE to fetch some of the prices. Seems that stockanalysis, finviz and googlefinance don't always agree which investment product a ticker represents (e.g. TILT) so there can be some data mistakes.
* mostly works for companies listed on US exchanges

I did this for my amusement, it's not investment advice.

For some ETFs that saw a huge dip, e.g. ARKK or ARKW, the computed target was close to the historical maximum, so I wonder how much price bias is there in the target price published by analysts (i.e., analysists try to reason current price, rather than coming up with a proper valuation).

I'm going to track this for a while to see how useful this information is.

Edit 1: I explained here how I computed the table: https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mijk9h/i_computed_the_weighted_average_upside_for_100/gt563uy. tl;dr:  ETF's upside is computed from the allocation weighted upside of the individual stocks comprising the ETF.

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs). Also it doesn't work with non-US listed stocks (e.g. finviz doesn't have data for the ESPO stocks https://stockanalysis.com/etf/espo/holdings/)","['AAPL', 'ARKK']"

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

mig57o,gt7nmuh,investing,comment,1617421308,"Climate change results in catastrophe *only* if it is not managed. We are currently on track for a 3+ deg C increase in average temperature. But efforts are underway to transition to a low-carbon economy and therefore a 2 deg C increase. How much is the investment needed? Around 190 trillion (Edit: 90 trillion) USD by 2030!!

In other words, there are *opportunities* in transition to a green economy, and one that has been enshrined in pledges both by public and private institutions. New energy generation, energy efficiency technology, sustainable practices, increase in carbon price and changing customer demands.

A very obvious one: carbon price. It is expected that carbon price needs to be at around 100 USD/eCO2MT in order to achieve the 2 deg transition. What is the current carbon price now? In Europe (the highest) it is only \~37 EUR! And yet the targeted emission reduction in the next few decades already mandates that there be 7% increase in carbon price per annum!

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

* ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.
* ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.
* HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia
* KRBN: tracks the carbon future price of the European Emission Trading Scheme and that in California. The best performing commodity in 2020, and arguably in the years to come. Unlike other commodities, the fundamental case is quite strong.  


Edit: Amount of investment needed is NOT 190, but 90 trillion. My bad!!",['MSCI']

Going into college, there were a few things I really wanted to work towards purchasing. 
-boat
-atv
-something to haul them with (truck)
-house
-cabin 

I understood that it was a lot, but I figured I’d get a good job and get there one step at a time. 

I recently finished paying off my student debt (50k) four years after college (6 years out now). I lived way below my means to make this happen. Recently, I have gotten into investing and I am very focused on compound interest. I started maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, and also started a brokerage account for additional stocks. I continue to live below my means, and I like it that way. Investing makes me feel fulfilled, like I have a real goal I am working towards. 

When I think about those items mentioned above, I no longer get excited. I see them as mountains of debt. I want to buy a house, but I don’t want to do it in this seller’s market. The other items just seem like unnecessary obstacles to reaching my investment goals. I don’t make enough money to accomplish both.

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people. The thing with the USD is the inflation is pretty predictable, and prices relatively stay the same throughout the years. But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving

mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

> SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m   

Debt and accumulated equity deficit are not the same thing. Debt of a company is the total liabilities. Which in the case of SUNW is only $18M, mostly short term operational debt. Their long term liability is only a few million.  

The -$88m is their total accumulated equity deficit since inception. Not money they owe.  

> SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020. 

This appears to be because they generate most of their revenue from commercial solar projects, not residential installs.  Smaller number of large scale project, which is how they generate almost $40M in revenue from 500 installs.

In general, with a focus on commercial I’m not surprised they took a revenue hit. But they ended 2020 with $39M in the bank. Added another $49M through a stock issue. They don’t have a cash problem.  

And last year they lost $15M, $4 of which was Goodwill and $3M in one time legal fees and bad debt. Nothing unusual here.

It is still over valued IMO but there is nothing wrong with their balance sheet and they have plenty of working capital. They have a lot of cash and they appear to be using it to acquire smaller solar companies.",['MMM']

I have been seeing, for the past few months, a lot of news regarding the Turkish lira and how it lost so much value and how Turkey's economy is in shambles, etc. Not only that but Erdogan doesn't make things easier and might very well take the country to total economic collapse.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision? As far as I see it, because the lira devalued so much, it would be much cheaper for someone holding other currencies.

mh6l6f,,investing,post,1617198775,"Goldman Sachs is close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clientsGoldman Sachs is close to offering its first investment vehicles for bitcoin and other digital assets to clients of its private wealth management group, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

I have AAPL (7 shares), AMZN (.13 shares), TSLA (.6 shares), DIS (2 shares), CCIV (31 shares), CMG (.13 shares), COST (.64 shares), VYNE (12 shares), RWT (20 shares), VHT (.5 shares), VNQ (5 shares), VOO (.2 shares)., ARKK (1.4 shares), THNQ (2.15 shares), BOTZ (.6 shares), ARKQ (.29 shares) and ARKX (2 shares).

My goal was to continue buying fractional shares each pay check in Amazon, Tesla, Costco and Chipotle so I can slowly accumulate more equity over time, but I'm beginning to wonder if it makes more sense to just sell my fractional shares and re-allocate those investments into VOO and ARKK. I do like holding single stocks of Apple and Disney and since they aren't quite as high in cost I've been able to buy whole shares which is nice. I guess I'm not sure if trying to obtain a single share of Amazon over time is even worth it, or if I'd see a greater return putting $3k into VOO. I do plan to eventually get rid of VYNE, I bought that on a whim and am in the red but I've been waiting for it to bounce up.

So I guess I'm just looking for general feedback on whether it would make sense to continue beefing up my standings in some of these stocks over time or if I'd be better suited to just put those dollars into indexes and ETFs for the most part?","['TSLA', 'DIS', 'AMZN', 'CMG', 'AAPL', 'ARKK']"

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

mh8g4b,,investing,post,1617204139,"MKTY, the undiscovered biggest competitor of Riot and MaraEarly Feb, miners have been in a tailwind. Given high valuations of MARA and RIOT, I've been looking at under-the-radar companies operating in miners industry.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion**  
MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

mhaez0,,investing,post,1617209689,"ZDGE - 80% revenue growth at a 45 PE ratio offers 90% upside (DD)(First DD, constructive criticism appreciated)

**What is Zedge?**

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

&#x200B;

**Thanks for reading, and would like to hear any thoughts**

mhaez0,gsxqvf2,investing,comment,1617212160,"This may sound hand-wavey, and I suppose it is, but something doesn't smell good to me. The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up. Like I said, I don't know if this is true, and I didn't see an answer in my 5 second Google search. Having tried literally all options myself (/s), it's now up to you.",['GOOGL']
mhaez0,gsxplgr,investing,comment,1617211588,"Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

mh4gbw,,investing,post,1617191640,"My take on Gold's longterm outlookFrom a technical perspective, gold is in a 10 year long c[up and handle](https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1617190625002.png) pattern, and it could go sideways for many more years until a breakout target of about 2900 is met. The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['NDAQ', 'DOW', 'ADP', 'SPGI']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

The etf is up 20% for now. 
That's higher than the usual return you get on such an etf.

What's best practice in such a case? 

1.) Realize the gains and reinvest 

2.) Realize the whole fund and wait for the (inevitable?!) correction to re-invest at a lower point

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

I know that time in the market beats timing the market, but can't imagine that one should let such an opportunity slip (especially as it is a very young investment).

mgwrdt,,investing,post,1617159948,"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market. It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys. Stuff like WDI Corp, which runs restaurant chains:  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3068:JP

Edit 2: The model has settled down- now 2000-2500 a day in late April. That's still state of emergency level, but regular state of emergency level, such as closing restaurants early. Maybe better to just wait this out and buy the dip.",['GOOGL']

mgwrdt,gsvwq8o,investing,comment,1617169159,"To answer your question directly: 2 ways I can see. You can shortsell / buy puts on:

1. ALNPY - All nippon airways adr. No options but you wanna bet might as well go big if you think travel will take a hit
2. EWJ - if you just want a market level bet.

Let me know when you place the trade. As someone living in Tokyo, I'll happily take the other side of your trade. 

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

2. The largest Japanese stocks are carmakers, consumer electronics, and financial services. They aren't heavily tied to the vaccine & recovery trade (I could argue some may even be anti recovery).",

mgwz1w,,investing,post,1617160710,"FTC files suit against Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with GrailIn an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-of-liquid-biopsy-firm-grail-11617131491

Personally I believe this will take some time to wash out and I expect a bigger correction in ILMN stock. I believe this represents an opportunity for entries into a long position in ILMN. I have a hard time believing this merger won’t go through.

Also, while these companies have done a great job of branding, fundamentally they're still lenders, they make money when you fail to pay and when you use their services at checkout (they charge the merchant).

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, “A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

mn01d5,,StockMarket,post,1617911745,"7 Things You Need To Know Right Now That May Impact Your Portfolio (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More) **In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

mn01d5,gtuoona,StockMarket,comment,1617913370,"I agree with most of this.

It's not enough to fantasize that the FED will raise rates if inflation gets over 2%, they've been very clear; they're not even going to look at doing that before the fall, and they're not going to raise rates while the recovery remains uneven. As long as unemployment is still inflated in the bottom quartile, rates will be near 0. No amount of hand-waving will make this policy more conservative.

Powell pointed out that the unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. This is the number that matters, not the 6%.

If you look at the Greed and Fear index over time you can see it has very little predictive value, it oscillates rapidly from top to bottom all the time. [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/)",

Now Supreme is at .40 per share and Canopy is at 36.05. if Supreme shares go up or Canopy shares go down before the deal is finalized, does that change the purchase price?

If they don't find a merger partner, they'll liquidate for something less, depending how good the managers are at giving themselves bonuses.

I've bought some SPACs, I'm holding some SPACs, I'm ahead, but I don't recommend it. You can do a lot better by buying micro-caps that have paperwork you can read. Wait for post-merger, and then don't pay over $12, and if it goes up, sell the darn thing! Sell it fast. Don't worry about missing the top of the peak, you won't get a second chance.👼",

This is a continuation of a series of posts related to the indirect metrics of public companies, here are the rest - [traffic’s growth for 6 months period](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mceny3/ive_analyzed_the_websites_of_the_top_3000_public/),[ number of employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md7y4m/ive_been_analyzing_the_data_on_employee_growth/),[ hiring dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mfwjwe/ive_analyzed_job_openings_for_the_top_3k_public/).

Why am I doing this? I believe that indirect companies' metrics are related to their stock price. When more historical data accumulates, I will try to find a statistical correlation between the indirect indicators of the company's performance (traffic, employees, ratings from employees, behavior in social networks) with its stock price and publish a post with the results of my whole research.

Below you can find a list of the top 5 companies based on traffic’s growth:

**1. AKKS Pacific Inc. ($JAKK)** \- cheap enough stocks that have been decreasing in price for the past 5 years. It seems to me that the company is actively shorting similar to GME. They produce toys and consumer products;

**2. TuanChe Limited ($TC)** \- cheap stock price, similarly. It’s a chinese company engaged in the automotive marketplace;

**3.** **WEX Inc. ($WEX)** \- provider of payment processing and information management services to the United States commercial and government vehicle fleet industry;

**4. Canoo ($GOEV)** \- the current stock price is $10. This company is a manufacturer of electric vehicles;

**5. Kansas City Southern ($KSU)** \- transportation holding company. The reasons for the traffic’s growth are not obvious here for me.

Hovering with support around $25-$26 for a couple weeks with many ups and downs. It’s a SPAC, so people are selling it when they need the money elsewhere, and it was pumped earlier this year on speculation and high stoke from being on Mad Money. 

But it’s turning into STEM. Stem is not a SPAC, it is a proven company with 2 years ahead of business already contracted in with big companies from Amazon, Walmart, google, Home Depot, etc. 

They have contracts for revenue increasing to 100+ billion year over year. They are run by established CEOs who have run very successful and large brands previously.

This is far from technical DD, but here is a link for a meeting on the 12th, to talk more about what this company is doing. They are going to be huge in the market of energy storage and green energy as a whole. It will be a booming market and some analysts have put a price point over $100 by year end. 

I’ve had a variety of positions this year, but STPK(STEM) remains by biggest.

mmovgd,,StockMarket,post,1617877872,"Follow up to the news about NIO; and amusing update on Jim Cramer losing his mind.Hey again,

So after my last post about NIO's news, and the hilarity of Jim Cramer in his attempt to manipulate NIO's price - clearly trying to get NIOgang to sell - which as I mentioned in my last post in edit 2 he deleted [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721); well, now it's even weirder.

First, you all should know that NIO has more good news recently: in an interview for the ceremony NIO had commemorating their 100,000th EV produced, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin has mentioned that they man plan to be more 'aggressive and higher' in their target of 500 battery swap stations built this year; meaning they're probably planning on building more since he's saying the 500 is a conservative goal; here's the [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/08/nios-william-li-says-reaching-500-battery-swap-stations-this-year-is-conservative-goal/).

Moreover, it's also been revealed in this interview that once NIO's ET7 is out, they'll be planning on releasing another sedan that will be more competitive with Tesla's model 3; here's the [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/04/08/nios-william-li-says-second-sedan-will-be-launched-in-the-future-more-competitive-than-tesla-model-3/). Also, he's said that NIO will be planning on building more plans in order to meet the production capacity, and that the intelligent EV industrial park NIO's building with the Hefei municipal gov will start on April 29--big news!

So more infrastructure, more models, and more production is coming for NIO--that's great right? Absolutely yes; NIOgang loves NIO and we like the stock (GME and [u/TheRoaringKitty](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheRoaringKitty/) respect)...so where does amusement come in again? That's right, Jim Cramer again! Lmfao.

Jim Cramer has effectively lost his mind in his attempt to try and cause more of a drop in NIO's price; perhaps his suit buddies weren't happy that he deleted his original bearish tweet. Well, he's now back at it; he has just put another tweet out saying that NIO isn't as good as Tesla; and why would you trust the Chinese Tesla bla bla bla; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1380078487671861248).

First off, this is stupid from Cramer. It wasn't very long ago--in January this year in fact, that he was saying NIO is the next Tesla. Here's the [link](https://www.thestreet.com/video/why-jim-cramer-thinks-nio-is-next-tesla). So it looks dumb on his part to flip-flop like this in such a short time frame--although **short** might be a reason...him and his suit friends, that is.

Secondly, those of us who've payed attention to Tesla's history, knows that Cramer is no friend of Tesla. Do you of you remember when Cramer was saying Tesla is a bad investment? Here the [link](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1380091798224134148/photo/1) to refresh your memories; Cramer actually called Tesla a ""bad company"" years ago.

I think we're simply seeing Cramers opportunism; simply flip flop when it suits him and his friends at the expense of the retail investors. What's hilarious is that NIOgang is really going after him on his twitter, some favorites include [1](https://twitter.com/InvestorJpk/status/1380092981789736961), [2](https://twitter.com/Arno_Lacompte/status/1380102779839078402), [3](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1380088296827588619)

I want to say thank you to all of you for the appreciation you showed to my last post; look I know that most of what I like to talk about is NIO--but like many of you AMC, GME, PLTR, TSLA, etc.,. apes who're passionate about your diamonds, and yes I agree, I love them too--I'm just as passionate about NIO. What's funny is that I first learned about NIO here way before I even had a reddit account.

I hate both countries governments, theirs and ours--but I love NIO, I like the stock; and I'm pretty sure GME gang, AMC gang, and NIOgang are really all family; and we stand against serial manipulators like Cramer and his suit buddies he serves.

Thanks everyone; stay long and strong.","['TWTR', 'TSLA']"

The company's leading  candidate is **PRV-031 (teplizumab**), a medicine that could delay the onset  of type-1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk patients; no such approved drug  exists at the moment. In a phase 2 clinical trial, a 14-day course of  PRV-031 delayed the onset of T1D by a median of about three years  compared to the placebo. **PDUFA** decision on **July 2** for PRV-031.

 The **diabetes market** is  huge. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), some 34.2 million Americans suffer from the illness, while 88  million have prediabetes. While some 90% to 95% of cases of diabetes are  of the type 2 variety, **PRVB** still sees a market opportunity  of more than **$1 billion** in the U.S. alone for its indication. And given  the excellent results displayed by the drug in clinical trials, it looks  very likely to earn approval.

I think there is a good chance that **PRV-031** will achieve blockbuster status. This drug's approval would also validate the **PRVB** masterplan to  develop drugs to prevent severe illnesses. The company has other  products in its pipeline, including one being investigated for the  prevention of systemic lupus erythematosus.

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume.  Any ideas on why the small price action?
Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   


This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.

mml4rd,,StockMarket,post,1617860895,"Rite Aid ( RAD ) Remains on Track Despite Projected Q4 EBITDA Miss Stock Analysis**Rite Aid Remains on Track Despite Projected Q4 EBITDA Miss**

(by **The Sound of Money** as seen on **Seeking Alpha** on April 7, 2021)

***Management Updates Guidance***

On March 25, 2021, Rite Aid provided updated guidance for the 2021 fiscal year that closed on February 27, 2021. In that guidance, Rite Aid indicated the following:

· Full year revenue of approximately $24 billion (on target with guidance of $23.9 - $24.2 billion provided on December 17, 2020).

· Fully year net loss of $90 to $100 million (in line with guidance of $89 - $114 million provided back on December 17, 2020)

· Full year adjusted EBITDA of $425 - $435 million representing a miss of $65 - $85 million versus the December 17, 2020 guidance.

The adjusted EBITDA miss caused RAD shares to tank more than 20% and settle below $19 per share. But was that price reaction in the stock warranted?

***Deutsche Bank Raises Price Target on RAD***

The following day on March 25, 2021, despite the blow that had been dealt to RAD shares by the market, Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Rite Aid to $27 from $17 and added the stock to its “Catalyst Call Buy Idea” list. What could be behind this vastly divergent view held by Deutsche Bank compared to that of the general consensus on Wall Street?

***The Q4 COVID Effect***

The EBITDA hit taken by Rite Aid during Q4 of the company’s 2021 fiscal year was directly related to a unique, non-repeating event, namely the explosion in spread of COVID-19 infections that took place throughout that 90-day period. The spike in USA COVID-19 cases was centered directly in Rite Aid’s Q4 which ran during the months of December 2020 to February 2021. During Rite Aid’s fiscal 4th quarter, much of the nation was on lockdown mode. Visits to retail stores were less frequent, and acute prescriptions were down. Most devastating to Rite Aid’s profitability during the quarter was the fact that precautions taken to avoid COVID-19 spread, also dramatically reduced the incidence of common cold and flu.

Rite Aid’s 4th quarter EBITDA miss is a one-off, COVID-19 related event that is now in the rearview mirror. Looking ahead, there are significant tailwinds that should bolster the company’s financial performance in the 2022 fiscal year which began on February 28, 2021.

***The Re-Opening Trade***

In addition to the updated guidance provided by Rite Aid on March 25, 2021, the company gave some insight into the start of the new fiscal year (2022) that began on February 28, 2021:

*""Looking ahead, we have seen acute prescriptions return to positive levels in March…”* – Heyward Donigan, CEO, Rite Aid

In the first quarter of the prior (2021) fiscal year, Rite Aid saw a year-over-year decline in acute prescriptions of 14.8% resulting from the postponement of outpatient medical visits and elective surgical procedures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The prior year decline in acute prescriptions contributed to a 2.6% decline in adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decline in Rite Aid’s acute prescription sales continued throughout the first half of fiscal 2021, with a drop of 4.9% in that year’s second quarter. However, with the economy re-opening, outpatient visits and elective surgical procedures have now largely returned to normalized levels, as is indicated by Rite Aid’s report of a positive trend in acute prescriptions during the first month of the new fiscal year, 2022. As a result, Rite Aid should see a significant increase in year-over-year acute prescriptions which should contribute to an increase in adjusted EBITDA during the first half of the current fiscal year. As well, with the COVID-19 lockdown now concluded in the USA, it can be reasonably expected that visits to local drug stores will increase relative to the first half of the prior year, with a broader range of products being purchased by consumers beyond just cleaning products and disinfectants. As such, front-end retail store revenues will likely see a year-over-year boost, adding further to improved adjusted EBITDA results.

***Impact of Coronavirus Vaccinations***

Another significant contributor to Rite Aid’s improvement in first half fiscal 2022 results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. Recently, the US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose. Within Rite Aid’s updated guidance announcement issued on March 25, 2021, Rite Aid CEO, Heyward Donigan remarked:

*“…we are proud to be selected as one of the retail providers administering COVID vaccines in the majority of our key states and cities, representing over 1,800 of our stores. We are significantly ramping up the number of vaccines we are administering on a daily basis, and have administered approximately 1 million COVID vaccines in March to date.”*

At the rate of vaccination indicated by this statement above, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

***Second Half of Fiscal 2022 Will See Benefits from Cold / Flu Season***

Rite Aid’s 2nd half of fiscal year 2021 saw earnings take a significant hit due to the weak cold and flu season during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. However, experts are concerned that the upcoming cold and flu season could by dramatically worse. As face-to-face interaction between people returns as a result of the end of the lockdown, there will be far greater spread in the USA of virus that cause cold and flu. Also, as a result of last season’s reduced flu level, there exists little data for utilization in the development of the upcoming seasons flu shots. With little data available to scientists, the 2021 – 2022 flu shots may not be highly effective at preventing the flu. On a relative basis, Rite Aid is likely to see much higher year-over-year revenue and profits in the second half of the fiscal 2022 (September 2021 through February 2022) related to cold and flu remedies.

***Long-Term Debt Remains a Downside Risk***

The long-term debt level remains a concern for Rite Aid. As of the Q3 earnings report, the company indicated that debt stood at $3.2 billion. The interest level required to service this debt amounts to approximately $200 million per year, which is a drag on earnings to the tune of approximately $3.65 per share. Thus far, Rite Aid has demonstrated that it is capable of servicing this debt level successfully, and it expected to report positive free cash flow for the full year fiscal 2021. However, if there is an unexpected downturn in the economy or Rite Aid’s performance, the long-term debt could put the company’s financial future in jeopardy.

***The Author’s Estimate of Rite Aid’s Fiscal 2022 Forward Guidance***

Based on the assumptions noted above, I have calculated an estimate of Rite Aid’s forward-looking guidance for the company’s fiscal year 2022. My figures for Rite Aid’s financial outlook for the current fiscal year are as follows:

**FISCAL YEAR 2022 PROJECTIONS (BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S ESTIMATES)**

**Total Revenues: $24.9B - $25.2B**

**Same Store Sales: 4.0% - 5.0%**

**Adjusted EBITDA: $590M - $620M**

**Net Gain: $6M - $31M**

**Adjusted net income per share: $2.45 - $2.85**

**Capital Expenditures: \~$225M**

**Free Cash Flow: $170M - $220M**

***Conclusion***

Rite Aid’s financial performance for fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to a reduction in acute prescriptions and low sales of cold and flu treatments. During the current fiscal year (2022), the company is likely to see a strong revenue and profit improvement as it benefits from tailwinds created by normalized demand for acute prescriptions, cold and flu remedies, and the boost provided from reimbursements for COVID-19 vaccine administration. Vaccine administration is likely to benefit Rite Aid in the long-term, providing a growing revenue and profit stream for the company.",

Stocks traded largely flat on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) hovering near record highs, as market participants continue to consider the latest batch of strong economic data and commentary by FOMC members.

This week, market participants have digested a host of better-than-expected economic data, with the March job report blowing past consensus estimates, an index tracking activity in the service sector reached a record level, and The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February, the highest level since December 1983. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth forecast to 6% this year from the 5.5% rise seen previously, largely reflecting the expectation of quick recovery in the U.S. economy. Moreover, JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the current US economic boom “could easily run into 2023” amid the massive fiscal and monetary policy support provided to people and businesses. 

This week, the Federal Open Market Committee have shed light on how monetary policymakers are thinking about the current economic climate. Most important, market participants want to know what conditions would warrant an adjustment of the Fed’s current policy stance and their thoughts on potential inflation. FOMC members noted that the economy was “far from achieving the \[FOMC’s\] broad-based an inclusive goal of maximum employment” suggesting policymakers are willing to maintain their current accommodative stance for the foreseeable future, barring a sharp and unforeseen upturn in inflation or economic recovery.

Looking ahead, we are eagerly awaiting first-quarter earnings season in the coming weeks, with the hope that the reports show corporate profits are growing strongly in tandem with strengthening economic conditions. Deutsche Bank Strategist Binky Chadha wrote in a note “Very near term, we expect equities to continue to be well supported by the acceleration in macro growth, and see buying by systematic strategies and buybacks driving a grind higher. But we expect a significant period of consolidation as growth peaks over the next three months.”

mmjc8v,,StockMarket,post,1617853659,"How Has COVID-19 Impacted The Global 3D Printer Market And The 3D Printing Industry.As per The Business Research Company, global outbreak of COVID-19 has indirectly affected the 3D printing market as application of 3D printing in pharmaceutical and medical industries witnessed a major uptrend.

During the pandemic, global healthcare systems were put under critical strain due to severe shortages of hospital beds and medical equipment. Patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, are at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a fraction of these patients will require high-level respiratory support to survive. Due to such shortages in equipment, the demand for 3D printing has increased drastically.

3D printing devices are increasingly being used to manufacture medical devices, personal protective equipment (PPE), testing devices and even emergency dwellings to isolate people suffering from the disease. 3D printing community members closely collaborated with companies and hospitals to ensure adequate manufacturing approaches and appropriate clinical use.

The global 3D printer market reached a value of nearly $8.6 billion in 2020, having increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.8% since 2015. The market is expected to grow from $8.6 billion in 2020 to $20 billion in 2025 at a rate of 19.4%. The market is then expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.4% from 2025 and reach $39 billion in 2030.  The global 3D printing market is a rapidly growing and versatile industry due to its ability to adhere to various markets, cost effectiveness, and efficiency. 3D printing helps to create parts for the manufacturing of engines in the automotive industry, produces prototypes for houses that enforce architects be more innovative, helps create lighter tools, and is inexpensive for various industries such as healthcare and construction.

1. $GLSI had 100% success preventing breast cancer recurrence over the last 6 years in their clinical trial 1 & trial 2.
2. Management team has 35+ years working together on several other successful biotech startups. They’re just repeating a proven biotech business model.
3. Executive team already multi-millionaires from previous successful ventures, they have not paid themselves a salary since starting $GLSI, and thus the CEO stated on video a few months ago they do NOT need to raise additional capital.
4. CEO of $GLSI bought up 75% of the shares of GLSI…high insider conviction!
5. The drug originally developed by U.S. Gov, the CEO of GLSI bought the rights to the drug from the gov under the condition that GLSI would finish it’s development through all the clinical trials. The CEO notes this on a 2020 Benzinga video presentation.
6. MD Anderson Cancer Research facility in Houston, TX has performed all of $GLSI’s clinical trails, and is performing the final trial 3 as well. (MD Anderson = world’s best cancer research facility in the world, very difficult to get MD Anderson to accept performing clinical trials on a new biotech drug. Most biotech companies don’t have this resource, $GLSI does.
7. See price jump to $158 when the 1st half of data was presented at the American Association of Cancer Research in Dec 2020, showing 100% success over last 6 years in trails 1 & 2.
8. See $GLSI C.E.O. video on Benzinga PowerHour on March 11 saying Thursday April 8, 2021 Midnight they will be releasing the 2nd half of the data (immune response data) from their American Association of Cancer Research presentation April 2021. This is the last piece of data for $GLSI to start phase III trials for FDA approval. Video is linked.
9. Notice the stock price has been significantly increasing the past few days in anticipation of this new being release April 9 evening. $150+ price estimation on Friday April 9, 2021.
10. My metrics give $GLSI a 93% probability of success for FDA approval, with a price of $400-500+ after FDA approval. Recent stock price moves show many others agree with my estimation.

It does this by assessing the amount a stock is mentioned, the sentiment of the chatter surrounding that stock (how positive or negative that chatter is) and the interactions surrounding that chatter (upvotes, likes, retweets etc.)

The algorithm surfaces emerging stocks by looking at which stocks have seen a regular, non-spiky increase in chatter surrounding a stock.

The algorithm tries to remove pump and dump stocks by removing stocks that have seen a single spike in chatter, and ignoring chatter by newly created  or bot accounts.

ELS and SUI are incredibly similar and it's difficult to pick one or the other. UMH pays the highest yield and even though it's growing FFO/Share the payout ratio is so high that it can't grow it, maybe just keep it at the same level. If you had to pick ELS or SUI, which one would you pick? Maybe both?

mmjdhe,gtrrt97,StockMarket,comment,1617854019,"""Manufactured Homes"" are a polite way of saying ""mobile home"" or ""trailer park home"" or ""tornado magnet"" or FFT (FEMA Formaldehyde trailer).  I bet you were thinking ""pre-fab"", weren't you?

What people might not realize is that it is almost impossible for someone without collateral, in the twilight years of their life, to get a mortgage over a certain baseline amount.  The average home price has far exceeded that baseline amount and seniors, who are faced with the prospect of subsisting off of their social security, need to find *some* type of housing.  This property class is especially flexible because the elderly are willing to live where others are not (next to industrial areas and on the immediate perimeter of airports and other ""cheap land"" areas).

Trailer park communities consisting largely of seniors are starting to pop up all over the country anywhere below the rust belt.  These properties are almost considered government sponsored enterprises because their fund revenues are fueled by social security (so, if social security ever goes sideways, these funds will get destroyed).  Typically, the buyers of these ""homes"" don't even own the land on which they're parked.  When the occupants of these ""homes"" kick the bucket or become too sick to reside in them, these homes are repossessed, cleaned out and recycled to the next dying, broke boomer.

...and now the seniors are facing competition of America's working poor and illegal immigrants (remember that ""below the rust belt"" part, right?).  The combination of demographic and economic pressures make this type of property a growth sector at least for the next couple of decades.  However, given the sector's exposure to social security solvency, I feel like I should be getting at least a 5% dividend and better than 30% year on year growth.",

I am trying to do as much research about the stock market before purchasing any more stocks. Now I have been reading that there are stocks that are undervalued and some that are overvalued. From what I have been reading, Apple is an overvalued stock. My personal opinion is that it has a great forecast and it's undervalued... and a company I see as overvalued would be Tesla. But then again, I am just starting out.

As I'm researching more, I'm reading that we can take a look at a company's balance sheet to determine its value. Apparently, I'm to take the total assets in the balance sheet, subtract the total liabilities... and then divide that total by the number of stocks in the market?

And then another number I can compare my results with would be the Market Cap. I take the stock price at that given moment and multiply it by the number of stocks in the market. The total is what the Market currently thinks the company equity is.

Is this right? Is this a good way to determine if a stock is over or undervalued?

I know there are many more factors that could change the value and equity of the company, such as paying off debts and how they do so. But I think that's another lesson for me to learn on a different day.

Please help me understand if I'm getting this wrong. I really want to learn and would appreciate all the help I can get.

&#x200B;

Thank you!

&#x200B;

Edited to add: 

TLDR: How do you determine if a stock is undervalued or overvalued? What are your techniques/formulas? ","['AAPL', 'TSLA']"
mma3q7,gtq6x70,StockMarket,comment,1617825665,"Over/under-valued is supposed to be fundamental. You should keep that separate from your opinion on it.

You should be psychologically and emotionally able to say, ""I recognize that the stock is currently over-valued, but I think it has a better future than the professionals realize, so I still like it at this price.""

When you're completely honest about your evaluation, you end up with better information about what your opinion actually is. In this case, do you actually have better information about Apple's future than everybody else? Is there some popular idea about Apple that pulls the stock price down, that you think is incorrect? Are they planning to move into some new area of business that you understand, and most people don't realize is important?

For example, AMD. My day job is firmware engineer. AMD put out a press release earlier this year about two new patents. All the analysis I read, both in the stock market, and on the engineering websites, presumed these are two different, unrelated things, that they just coincidentally talked about on the same day. I disagree; I think they're part of one new future product, that is also related to their Xilinx acquisition, and will bring real advantages to their server products. Right now their server market share is only 10%; the forecasts are that they will increase this to 20% in about 18 months. If they come out with a new product that enhances their competitive position in this area right when they're also already expanding their market share, that could be a huge driver for them and for the stock. So I think the stock is really worth at least 15% more than it can be objectively valued at now. But that doesn't mean it is undervalued now; just that I have a higher price target!

Another example is if a hedge fund releases research report that bad-mouths a company, and the stock goes down, and you read the report (most people don't even read it, they just sell!) and you think the report doesn't actually accuse them of anything. So then you might reasonably have a different evaluation than others.

As with all other parts of trading and investing, psychology is the most critical aspect of success. Don't be credulous of your own opinions; and treat your emotions with skepticism. When you love a stock, be nervous about your evaluation. You want to trade on what you rationally think will go up, not what you love.👼","['AMD', 'AAPL', 'XLNX']"
mma3q7,gtq75os,StockMarket,comment,1617825766,"There have been whole books and careers dedicated to determining the value of a stock.  There is no magic bullet or set of formulas to give you a definite answer, you can do all the research in the world but in the end the market is irrational and will always do what it wants.  The saying goes “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”.

Don’t get analysis paralysis, the best way to learn is through experience.  Start with broad market ETFs and work your way slowly (in manageable increments of money you can afford to lose) into individual stocks after getting a general knowledge of GAAP and macroeconomics (interest rates, bond yields, monetary policy, international trade).

All the statistics you mentioned (market cap, book value per share) are already listed on Yahoo Finance for free.  If you have a broker they most likely provide additional tools (eg ToS by TD Ameritrade).

Why is it saying that the cost of a 1.30$ stock order for a single share exceeds my settled cash balance?

""Selling these shares before paying for them could result in a violation""... But I literally have almost 300$ in available cash on my account. Since my bank/brokerage are the same entity any money I transfer over is usually available within an hour or so to purchase stocks without getting any warning like that so this is very odd.

It's been like a day now, never had this problem before and wondering what the issue is.

I'm sure others have had this problem but I honestly don't see any reason for my balance to not be settled considering I only buy stocks and not options or anything that I could go negative on. My balance is still there, unchanging. Can't lose any more than you've already invested with stocks..",
mm6lby,gtpqydu,StockMarket,comment,1617818854,You may just have to convert it into US cash,
mm6lby,gtq2us5,StockMarket,comment,1617823941,"""Selling these shares before paying for them could result in a violation""

This doesn't mean the order exceeds your balance.

It means your balance isn't settled. So if you buy this stock, you have to wait until the purchase settles (3+days) to sell it again, unless you put new real money into your account before selling, but it usually takes 2 days for the new money to settle anyway.

And even if you put new money in, the warnings on the screen usually don't consider that. They just look at, were the shares purchased with unsettled funds, or not? So if you put new money in, and it settled, you'll still get the warning when you sell, and it is up to you to keep track of the amounts.

Also, just having settled money isn't good enough; it has to be new money. If you sell one stock today, then in two days you spend part of it on a new stock, with those unsettled funds, you can't just sell those new stocks when the funds settle. You have to wait until your purchase settled, because the newly-settled funds in your account are not new funds you added.

So it doesn't matter what your settled balance is now, it matters what it is at the moment you make the trade; which funds were used for the trade. It isn't about losing more than you have, it is about leaving the brokerage holding your bags while you wait for the funds to arrive. This is important, because otherwise people can scam the brokerages by making fake trades where they control both sides and the money never actually arrives. So they set up rules to ban it, otherwise the less scrupulous brokerages would let you do it, and then the others would have to let you do it to compete, and then they'd all get scammed bigtime by the Russians, and they'd ask the government for a bailout. So the rules are this way.",

Stocks traded roughly flat Tuesday, putting a pause on the recent record-breaking rally. Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies' first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that's actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that's taking the market higher. And I don't think we're done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you're going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.""

The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon.

**Highlights**

* US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged the adoption of a minimum global corporate tax rate during virtual meetings with the World Bank and IMF.
* An index tracking U.S. service sector activity surged to an all-time  high in March, the Institute for Supply Management said Monday

Topps is best known for its sports trading cards, specializing in baseball cards for over 75 years. The company recently entered the non-fungible token space. Michael Eisner, former Disney CEO, is the chairman of the company.
* A U.S. auto industry group on Monday urged the government to help as it warned the global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
* The International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for global growth this year amid a better-than-expected outlook for the U.S. and other major economies. The institution now sees worldwide growth increasing 6% this year, up from the 5.5% rise seen previously. This follows a historic contraction of 3.3% in 2020. 
* Credit Suisse said Tuesday it expects to take a writedown work 4.4 billion Swiss franc, or $4.7 billion, as of a result of the implosion of Archegos Capital, Bill Hwang’s hedgefund that got a massive margin-call recently

mly6th,,StockMarket,post,1617787093,"benefits of alternative data in finance **Introduction**

We noticed that many folks out there still underestimate the 'power' of alternative data, despite recent price surges in several meme stocks, which could have easily been spotted ahead of time if one would monitor metrics like attention and sentiment on a daily basis. Therefore we want to give a brief summary on academic findings regarding the predictive abilities of those metrics and show how to leverage alternative data as the individual investor can hardly rely on a dedicated team which analyzes alternative data on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

**Research Findings**

There are several academic papers exploring the advantages of alternative data. Most studies we've read, found that the data can be used to forecast at least one metric with regard to financial time series. The different findings are likely due to their differences in sourced data as they all analyze sentiment and/or attention but from different sources.

The following list is rather short compared to all the papers we read, but it should be sufficient to show how important alternative data is in todays markets.

**#1** [\[The impact of sentiment and attention measures on stock market volatility\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301645)

Analyzed Metrics:

1. \[sentiment, attention\]

Conclusion:

1. \[sentiment and attention measures have significant predictive power for future volatility\]
2. \[alternative data can enhance classical models' accuracy significantly\]

**#2** [\[Twitter mood predicts the stock market\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S187775031100007X)

Analyzed Metrics:

1. \[sentiment\]

Conclusion:

1. \[accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions\]
2. \[86.7% accuracy in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA\]

**#3** [\[The Sum of All FEARS Investor Sentiment and Asset Prices\]](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/28/1/1/1682440)

Analyzed Metrics:

1. \[sentiment\]

Conclusion:

1. \[sentiment data can predict short-term return reversals\]
2. \[sentiment data can predict temporary increases in volatility\]
3. \[sentiment data can predict mutual fund flows out of equity funds and into bond funds\]

**#4** [\[Widespread Worry and the Stock Market\]](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14023)

Analyzed Metrics:

1. \[anxiety, worry and fear\]

Conclusion:

1. \[anxiety can predict downward pressure on the S&P 500 index\]

**#5** [\[Forecasting abnormal stock returns and trading volume using investor sentiment: Evidence from online search\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207011000021)

Analyzed Metrics:

1. \[online ticker searches as proxy for investors sentiment\]

**#6** [\[On the Predictability of Stock Market Behavior Using StockTwits Sentiment and Posting Volume\]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40669-0_31)

**Alternative Data And Trading**

Most of the time academic findings are quite nice, but for several reasons it is pretty damn hard to just trade what they found as there is a huge gap between their mathematics and real-life financial markets and let's not forget that each paper sourced data differently which makes things way more complicated.

But after getting all this data (like in 'a real-time stream of never-ending data') and processing it (again in real-time, like in 24/7) we were able to monitor the S&P 500 constituents with regard to investors sentiment and overall attention (obviously we monitor other metrics as well but for the sake of this post we skip that part).

At the end of each week we check the prior week's top attention and sentiment stocks and buy them for the upcoming week. If we would've traded those picks, we would have made about **16%** since 04.01.2021 to 29.03.2021 which is about twice the SPY's return in the same period.

&#x200B;

[screenshot: thebaite.com](https://preview.redd.it/t1thnbqvxpr61.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c33f50e7aa58bcb1e9c279f956c56b0c020541)

Obviously it is pretty easy to just say this without some evidence that we knew the corresponding stocks ahead of time. The good news is: we posted those trading ideas each monday ahead of the opening bell on [tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/u/thebAIte/), on [stocktwits.com](https://stocktwits.com/thebAIte) and send it to all those who subscribed to our weekly f\[AI\]nance reports. If one would have followed us all along, he/she/it could have easily made those gains. The bad news is: we do not provide those ideas for free anymore.

&#x200B;

**Leverage Alternative Data**

In order to incorporate alternative data into your trading, you would have to either pay huge amounts to get a reliable API connections and a powerful processing unit (with appropriate systems to extract and evaluate alternative metrics) or you would have to find a legit alternative data provider, which sell their data, in general, for a rather high price.

Actually there is a huge lack of alternative data vendors for retail traders, but the next good news is: the b\[AI\]te (we) offers a free version of their [alternative data platform f\[AI\]nance](https://thebaite.com/products). If you want to tap into alternative data you might [register](https://thebaite.com/register) for the free version and get a feeling for what it is like to utilize alternative data the right way.

Nevertheless, after getting access to alternative data (which is the trickiest part) and processing it (which is not less tricky) it can support your decision-making process in several different ways as mentioned in the academic papers' findings. You could just trade outliers in your data (like we did above) or go as far as predicting fund in- and outflows for further portfolio allocation in order to reduce your beta or further boost your alpha.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

We hope we were able to illustrate some advantages of alternative data and provide useful content for further reading so that you can get a better understanding of how important alternative data has become in todays market.

mlvjec,,StockMarket,post,1617775096,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIOHey again everyone,

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)","['TWTR', 'TSLA', 'IR']"

Also in this current market many people have lost trust is EV. The year of the EV/ clean energy was 2020 in my opinion. I mean a lot of these plays are still down insane amounts compared to the rest of the market. 

Nio and GME arent the same and didnt go up/ down for the same reason so its a little interesting you think they are trying to do the same thing... not everything is a conspiracy theory. In a year i think NIO will definitely be back up to its former glory/ price especially after some good earning reports (especially after the issues last time...) but Cramer saying its going to fall back down isnt really surprising in my opinion... Stocks to up and stocks go down...

Plus as another redditor explained the other day CNBC/ Cramer talk about stocks short term, mid term and long term... so that all has to be considered.

We are stuck in a pattern but there is a tremendous amount of news and deals. With the AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, T-MOBILE, VZ, T etc...... why in the world can’t this train leave the station.

NOK appears to be taking major market share from Huawei and has projects on tap with the US DOD etc... Just seams like momentum should be shifting. What in the world am I missing on this one?


Nokia (NOK) is a stock many investors are watching right now. NOK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 16.26. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.41. Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.35, with a median of 15.63.

Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 0.9. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.67.

These are just a handful of the figures considered in Nokia's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that NOK is an impressive value stock right now.","['AMZN', 'MSFT', 'VZ']"

I've been reading about the possible future outcome of both companies and My prediction is the following:

After global pandemic and with millenials and generationz's inability to socialize both companies will skyrocket in the upcoming years :)

If we however analyse the numbers on detail:

, Match group has a market cap of 37.71 B USD, with a year range of 87.56-174.68 a volume of 2.40 M, and a 18.58% revenue increase with 11.88 income increase, and a P/E ratio of 69.5 which could mean either that is an expensive buy now or that the company is growing. 

However on bumble we have 7.22 B USD market cap, 2.43 volume and a range of 57.40-84.80 $ since February  with no data yet on p/e ratio and an increase of 31.12 % on the revenue and -322. 91% on net income.

I'm trying to work something out in my head. Some people were saying Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and my argument was that no, it behaves like any other stock, options, futures, etc...

But that got me to thinking.

With a dividend-paying stock, you get value just from owning the stock. A payment for the amount of stock that you own, plus capital gains if people also want that sweet dividend and buy it up and increase the stock's price.

Is non-dividend stock completely based on capital gains (ponzi-esque) investing? Say you own 1000 shares of GME - the only value is based off what people were willing to pay for that, and you hope more people want it to drive the price up so you can sell, right?

I've read the argument that non-dividend paying companies use the capital that could be dividend payments to instead expand the company, therefore creating more value (which sounds like bullshit to me)... cause even if the company is more valuable, you still get nothing from owning the stock except the hope that more people buy the stock and drive the price up.

You’d need a big explanation to do make this decision but I’m just going to summarize this quickly...
Silver is undervalued x100
Why?
Huge global bank Ponzi scheme
If you remember the 2008 housing incident with the banks it’s very similar to that.
The Ponzi scheme is reaching the end of its cycle probably within the next 10 months meaning silver will absolutely explode. (And gold) 
The banks are trading tons of silver they don’t have with just paper receipts... so if you invest don’t buy the stock because the stock represents tangible silver. But the tangible silver doesn’t actually exist, meaning the stock won’t redeem itself. You need physical silver. Just look at J.P. Morgan. They are hoarding all the silver right now because they are aware of what’s going to come. 
Netherlands already started paying off people with cash because they can’t give them back their silver an entire year ago.
Research bank holiday.... the banks are going to try to cover up what’s happening behind the scenes. If too many people demand they’re silver from the banks at once, the banks will be completely exposed. 
And if they’re never caught for their Ponzi scheme, at least you prepared for it in case it happened. Think of it as money insurance. We know it’s there so bet on it happening because it will pay off immensely.
I recommend getting Canadian maple leaf silver coins because they don’t have the terrible American certification.

**Covaxin**  plays an important role because it is one of the only vaccines that has been shown to have a high defense to current and potentially future mutations of the virus.

**Covid Mutations already:** [LINK](https://srhd.org/news/2021/coronavirus-mutations-and-variants-what-does-it-mean)   |    **Covaxin is different:** [LINK](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/bharat-biotech-covid-19-vaccine.html)

&#x200B;

With the major catalyst from above in mind, if you take a look at when Phase 3 Interim II results came out for Pfizer's vaccine, they were only **about a month apart**.

**Covaxin Vaccine, Interim Phase 3 I: Mar 3, 2021** [LINK](https://www.bharatbiotech.com/images/press/covaxin-phase3-efficacy-results.pdf)

I  am expecting Interim Phase 3 II results for Covaxin within this trading week, from the timeline given in the above Pfizer example.

There isn’t even a secret sauce in what they do. There’s not going to be a Cinderella turn around story. Bag holders need to just accept this and get out while they can. It’s only a matter of time before Amazon enters into a more-exclusive agreement with Nintendo/Sony/Microsoft to carry substantially more inventory, pulling from smaller retailer inventories, or the console manufacturers just decide to cut the retailers out all together and sell only through their own retail channels and their own Amazon stores. I want to see GameStop win, but the hard truth is the odds are very stacked against them. There’s only so many Funko dolls and Manga you can sell before you go bankrupt.","['AMZN', 'MSFT']"

They can also build electric Sky Rails running in the middle of existing highways. 

They’ve also partnered up with NFI Group a global bus company. 

Here in the U.K. NFI Group are represented by Alexander Dennis buses, who finish building the Build Your Dream electric buses in the U.K. 

I feel there will be multi layers to the EV adoption.

mllc26,,StockMarket,post,1617742030,Best growth funds to invest in young.I saw a post earlier today I want to say it was on r/stocks but I’m not sure. One person mentioned what should I invest in at 17 and many people commented growth funds. So my question is what are some good high growth funds to just put money into regularly? I too am 17 and have a decent size portfolio for my age mostly dividend and blue chip stocks. I want a fund that is pretty stable and but has lots of growth potential. If a dividend is also included that’s great. If anyone has funds they’ve researched or invest in themselves I’m all ears. Being able to invest an x amount is also important to me so a mutual fund will be ideal but like I said if anyone has any sort of fund they would like to share I would love to hear.,
mllc26,gtmlm6p,StockMarket,comment,1617751045,"I posted this list a while back but it’s relevant to your question too. Here is a list of pretty stable ETFs, some more stable than others, with very brief descriptions of each. IMHO, I like the top 10 of the list better in terms of long-term stability (the ARK folks may not like that idea but it’s just my opinion.) I really like the leveraged funds too but I’m not as sold on the decades long stability prospects. I hold all of these in my current portfolio. I put $1k per month by automatic draft into my brokerage account that’s full of the following ETFs and common stock. I also put $500 each by auto draft into two Roth IRA ($1k total which is the max investment into a Roth). 

VOO- SP500 ETF

VOOG- large cap growth stocks from the SP500

VTI- Total market

SPY- SP500

DIA- 30 large cap US stocks in the DOW

XLK- tech stocks from SP500

IVW- SP500 growth stocks

QQQ- 100 NASDAQ stocks

ITA- DOW Jones Aerospace and Defense

XAR- SP500 Aerospace and defense

SCHD- 100 dividend paying US stocks

TQQQ- 3x leveraged exposure to 100 of the largest non financial NASDAQ stocks.

SPXL- 3x leveraged exposure to SP500

QQQJ- 100 non financial stocks that are expected to be eligible for inclusion in NASDAQ top 100.

ICLN- Global Clean Energy

DFEN- 3x leveraged exposure to aerospace and defense

ARK (there are a few that may be of interest)

I also hold some Fidelity mutual funds in Roth IRAs for my wife and I.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Goodmorning Traders ... Snap back after 410 or before 410, that is the Question... my 4/8/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY 

Snap back after 410 or before 410, that is the Question...... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... 

Earlier this week I hinted that there would be a great opportunity later in the week for a contrarian type trade. That trade, I’ve heard it called a snap back, as in the rubber band snapping back after it has been stretched to its limit. We have a great set up for it right now so let's get into today's outcomes.1) we hold support at the 407 area and then break thru the 408.61 Area which opens the door to the 410/411 area. 2) We break thru support at 406area opening the door to 405 and below and retest of 406/407 would be a great time to short. 3) Consolidation between 408 and 405 before breaking higher or lower. 

1) we hold support at the 407 area and then break thru the 408.61 Area which opens the door to the 410/411 area. **45% probability** 

https://preview.redd.it/cqfeebrx9yr61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=88d5afde3587b7432b17caf29c784cbe737a3ec6

2) We break thru support at 406area opening the door to 405 and below and retest of 406/407 would be a great time to short. **35% probability** 

https://preview.redd.it/qm31zbsy9yr61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e95fbbc81736eb94569b36bafb942ba4b3926702

3) Consolidation between 408 and 405 before breaking higher or lower. **20% probability** 

https://preview.redd.it/hkie46rz9yr61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=da19f4b76b14ed533a5c685fbe60013af28e805d

Because of economic data released at 8:30am I could switch probabilities of outcome #1 and #2 also there could be Prolonged consolidation (#3) in anticipation of Fed Chair Speech at 12pm",

It mainly dipped because of the Archegos Capital sell off and all that... it dipped 55%, back to where it was YEARS Ago before Covid and all the benefits they got form the stay-at-home life. 

Despite this, it dropped 55%, and still somewhat dropping. I wanted to wait a few days to see where it ended up, but with this being one of the most heavily shorted stocks right now, after a 55% drop, and  and now going to Pre-covid levels, despite killing earnings, seems like this would be a screaming buy,.  We all like our ""DeepFuckingValue"" plays, and while I still obviously love GameStop and many of the other value plays, this seems wildly undervalued... What am I missing here?

If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**

It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.

You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.

Over the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.

What happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.

The complaint alleges that GE and Plug ""understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable"" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just ""the JV"" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them ""the guys who financed 9/11"" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with ""nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server"" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.

Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, ""In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date"", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)

So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.

But the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)

Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm). Learn from the mistakes of the past. Sell the dip in PLUG.

They showed some new features and focused on how they normally show off new feature releases for their customers.  They also gave us a little something with what I like to call the ""X-Com Global Defense Demo"".  It literally fking rocked.

The stock was hovering at $34.32-$36.87 through the day and closed at $35.37 kinda non-spectacularly.

However, what happened the next day was a huge surprise to everyone since the stock surged to the ATH $45 before closed at $39.

This new demo coming on April 14th (next Wednesday) is the first in a \*series\* of demos.  Sounds like some more in depth about how it works.  Hopefully it's not just a bunch of doods with crappy microphones reading off a boring ass script in their kitchen again.

mmzkjx,,wallstreetbets,post,1617910425,"Fubo Tv-DD: A potential Short Squeeze, but also a low risk/high reward investment. 

Alright, listen up y’all. I’ve been working on some FUBO DD, and I will be presenting you a bull case, but not without presenting some counter arguments.

Pros: 

1. **Sports Betting**: As many of you may know, FUBO plans to add integrated sports gambling tied into their streams as an option. The sports gambling market is expected to roughly quadruple in the next 4 years overall. FUBO only needs to get a small slice of that pie. 
2. **Value compared it to its competitors**: FUBO has a market cap of about 2.9B. ROKU=48B. DFKN=24.5B. I think we all understand Roku and Draft Kings are much better at what they do then fubo, but 10x-20x more valuation? That’s a stretch. Simply based of FUBOs revenue and market cap, this stock should be tripled. 
3. **Aggressiveness as a company**; With the acquisition of Vigtory, and a recent closing of a deal with Marquee Network I like how they are not satisfied as a company and they are swinging for the fences. 
4. **Options spreads**: i don’t know if its big brained gamblers or insiders who know whats coming, but the recent Volume on Calls compared to Puts is ridiculous. A put/call ratio from 0.07-0.19 for the rest of April, and an implied volatility of 130%.
5. **Future Growth, Cord cutting**: Cord cutting has only just started. More and more will move to streaming platforms, and FUBO has been winning more than its fair share of those customers. Their expected revenue for 2021 is 460M which is incredible based on their market cap. They have 550k subscribers,73% growth year over year. Also their advertising deals are growing too, 53% growth year over year. receiving $20 per user for ads. 
6. **Institutional Holders:** Tutes own roughly 40% of the shares, Disney being one of the big share owners.
7. **Natural Cycle of a Growth Stock:** If anyone thinks this is a POS stock because it's gone down a bunch for no reason? Guess what, pretty much any young company has that experience before the rockets take off. Look at ROKU for example. From Nov19-March 20, it lost more than 50% of its value over that time period.Then it jumped up 600%
8. **Short Squeeze**: FUBO has some serious potential for a short squeeze, the short float is at 35%, and it's already been beaten down enough. We’ve seen plenty of examples of the shorts picking on a “cult” stock that is already down plenty from recent high, with relatively low float.

Reasons for the stock collapse:

It has been a perfect storm for Fubo bears. The stock has been  in a free fall since February.

1. A pullback from its parabolic rise in 3 months was inevitable.
2. The Q4 2020, ER report confirmed the company's growth. But because they are not making money, which of course they're not, there was a selloff nonetheless.
3. Money was shifted out of growth stocks to more profitable stocks recently.
4. There are some fugaze lawsuits coming FUBOs way, but any stock that has fallen this much is under lawsuit, this is nothing to worry about.
5. Arcehgo’s hedge Fund defaulted $30 billion, much of that was in media companies (most notably DISCA, VIAC, and to a lesser extent FUBO). 
6. FUBO’s IPO investor Lock-Up ended April 6th, and the sell off on the 7th.
7. The shorties, its always the fucking shorts

Cons:

1. Technical Analysis, which is wizardry to a mere mortal like me suggests that worst case scenario, FUBO goes down to $15. But I can’t imagine we will get there, I think it holds up at support. It has bounced off the 200ma 4 times in the last couple weeks.
2. I can only assume they are bleeding cash, and may need to have an offering soon
3. Their business model , vMVPD, seems like a very boomerish way of “cord cutting”. Because you’re still paying for a bunch of shit you may not want. 
4. Will the gambling aspect work? People like DFKG and fan duel just fine. 
5. There are probably some serious bag holders in the $30-40 range, and we could see some resistance from them as they look to sell when they break even. 

TLDR:

I think this is an amazing swing play for a squeeze, a good long term investment if the squeeze doesn’t come. FUBO is 1 PR away from triggering a beautiful run up, then the FOMO sets in, and boom, they are back at $30 before you know it. And if you degenerates start chipping in, we’re at $50+ in a heartbeat.There are some obvious negatives about the company & the stock, but if there wasn’t , this puppy would be at $150 by now. This is a low-risk, high reward play that we are lucky to even have the opportunity to be a part of.

mma558,,wallstreetbets,post,1617824434,"Hitch a $RIDE to the Moon: Technical Analysis of Lordstown Motors**PART 1: Introduction**

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY, why would you blindly listen to me? Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way

This might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors ($RIDE). It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out, and I’m all for it. I’ve been chart watching this for a while and I’m glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream, a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with. Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research, literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling”, coming in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real, to be a credible source?

But enough metaphors. Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock.

So that’s what I intend to do. I won’t give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of. If you want some of that [check out the post that was just made on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Instead, using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE. I’ve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on [oversold stocks like $RIDE](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05) that have all of the FUD priced in; live and die by the motto “buy the fear, sell the greed”. I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks, and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way.

If you find yourself falling asleep at any point, just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book.

**PART 2: Technical Analysis**

Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, they call me John D Cuckefeller, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with.

**Volume and Short Interest:**

Before we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ride), short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report, and has largely fallen and consolidated since then. Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave, realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally. Not only are they scared of people like you, who will target a stock just to hurt short-sellers, but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house.

Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, [to a total of 12.5 percent the total float](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/). And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent [reveal of the endurance betas](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/04/lmc-reveals-endurance-betas/) the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume. No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product? Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being “3-4 years away from production” like the bears claimed.

This is, in my opinion, *very significant* as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet.

**Relative Strength**

For anyone who’s a fan of indicators, it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold, to the point where demand can’t go anywhere but up. Just look at any relative strength oscillator; many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics. I won’t get too mathematical on you, but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock. Pretty simple. $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now, and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock. Rumors can’t last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum. This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company.

&#x200B;

[The relative strength of $RIDE, shown by Stochastics. More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion](https://preview.redd.it/jdeugezrvsr61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32d3b1fa3326fdff20c09b406c4780db04df869)

**MACD:**

This indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. Don’t overcomplicate this; when the purple line is above the orange line, the stock (often) goes up, and when it’s below the orange line it goes down. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events. In times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here; GameStop:

&#x200B;

[MACD analysis on GME. Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time?](https://preview.redd.it/hl89sol1wsr61.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=458e07447e4bc8462a3e6e982d2e67d493010e1d)

I noticed this crossover beginning to form, and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do. The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift. The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing, and the rest should be obvious. A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day. I couldn't predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and in a time of great FUD, I bought more.

Now lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE. Does the chart below give anyone else Déjà vu? Or did is it just me? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself with $RIDE:

&#x200B;

[MACD analysis on $RIDE, looking absolutely bullish AF. A thing of beauty 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/vsf3zynawsr61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=0970eb9794859538a9eade2fe7ab539c10842080)

This was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. Historically, the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center. Similarly, we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was).

Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange. This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline, $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I've been buying. When you see a MACD like this, I don’t really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting.

**Price Action:**

PRICE ACTION!!!

The most important indicator of all. It's easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action. A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator, which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around. For the sake of simplicity, I won’t go too far into this one. Individual candlesticks are valuable, but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment, and more importantly, the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so. Specifically, a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price. We don’t need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out, but instead just look at the actions of real market participants.

Combining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things.

[Positive divergence of the MACD and price action. Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend, and price is now consolidating before liftoff](https://preview.redd.it/0k28fdixwsr61.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed734f7bac97d0982b7f0791bf4e6df33c3b017)

Instead of the smooth 1-day period chart, we’re looking at a 4-hour period for more details. Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up? This is called positive divergence, and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction, which is a pretty big deal. Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal, and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst, I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us. As of just yesterday, April 6th, the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline, indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend. This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash, a huge amount of upward pressure is building. The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility, and though I don’t want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator, this could result in a “[Bollinger Band Squeeze](https://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BollingerandKeltnerSqueezeExample.jpg)” upwards very soon.

These are the indicators I use for any stock I look at, and for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30-$35, and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this.

**PART 3: Catalysts and Fundamentals**

Since indicators are driven by price action, which is itself driven by catalysts, they usually won’t run far without some sort of news to cling on to. As far as catalysts go, Lordstown did just release their [beta trucks](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas) last week. News which, I cannot stress enough, *I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET* as discussed earlier. They are also [showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a35598958/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/) in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17 (less than 10 days away). Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse-off competitors. The current price just doesn’t make sense.

I also I like the design of the truck itself; image is everything, especially when compared to some of its competitors (I’m sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing? Not to mention the Cybertruck). Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially. Yesterday, the Camping World CEO tweeted a [leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) (the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel) through [their partnership](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx). The electric RV market could be huge. The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid, for now.

**PART 4: Conclusion**

Well, I hope you learned a few things from this post, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. As I stated, this is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info; I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing. Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired.

And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here, and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this. Lest we all forget [Morgan Stanley’s 10$ price target on Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html), have a good $RIDE everyone, and don’t let the short bugs bite.

**Positions:** 65 shares at 12.94, 2x $20 07/16C, 1x 15$ 01/21/22c

**EDIT:** Forgot to add, but per page 21 of [this slide deck](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f), the current replacement value of Lordstown’s 6.2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion, but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2.01 billion. An EV stock that is trading almost 50% below its asset value? Come on now. Everything I’m seeing is screaming buy.

**TLDR;**

I love $RIDE’s pretty charts, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout, and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on. $RIDE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀","['NDAQ', 'TWTR', 'MS', 'TSLA']"

mmvxxc,,wallstreetbets,post,1617900478,"Quick DD on SunPower Corporation (SPWR)... highly shorted green energy company of interestI've done a bit of research on the [upcoming rebalance for Black Rock's green energy funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/mm5cdo/blackrockageddon_2_further_thoughts_and_work_on/). As seen in the link, 60-odd energy stocks are being added to the fund, at the expense of the existing larger stakes (looking at you, PLUG). 

.

While NEE is the little darling of the change, SunPower Corporation is on the short list of recommended adds. This is interesting, because SPWR is also on the *other* short list... [the list of highly shorted companies](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). SPWR at the time of this writing is over 22% short floated (GME is 24%), and I show -11% short float from the previous month. I'm surprised it's still this high, because the impending rebalance would buy a lot of shares, raising the price. Price goes up, shorts have to exit, things get squeezy. 

.

This is where I like to hope that some intern at one of these hedge funds is reading this post and going to get his boss. If WSB is aware of the potential squeeze, as well as the potential BlackRock buy, there are $600 million in shorts that need to make their way to the door ASAP. I'm not going to say this is Gamestop... we're not at $5... but the current suppressed price is $29.9, and the 3 week high is $35. Just removing the short pressure could get that back, even without the BlackRock buying. I like to hope just the potential of BlackRock's buy will take it that high, but WSB taking note might have a strong incentive effect on hedge fund rectal clenching and take it higher.

.

Fundamentally, SPWR is a semiconductor company, P/E ratio is 8.4 (well below semiconductor industry average 25.2), and profits are in a bit of a slump, which should pick up with the green push by the US Government. My interest is in the good price, the heavy short load, and the potential to squeeze. If Blackrock announces the stock in its ETFs, I expect a very nice rise.

.

tl;dr: SPWR is highly shorted and may join Blackrock ETFs. Hedge funds fear the ape. This makes for delicious banana.","['BLK', 'NEE']"

Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   


This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.

mmvxip,,wallstreetbets,post,1617900449,"Top 7 Must Know Things Right Now (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More)**In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this. 

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.** 

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week. 

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%. 

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage** 

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

mmur3e,,wallstreetbets,post,1617897133,"HIMX Earnings CatalystHIMX is a fabless semiconductor solution provider.

On Tuesday after hours HIMX pre-announced it’s preliminary 1st quarter key financial results.  It had ATH earnings.  1st quarter revenues, gross margin and EPS all exceeded guidance issued on February 4th.  Revenues, gross margins and EPS also all reached new peaks in the 1st quarter of 2021.

[apnews ](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/business-technology-products-and-services-asia-consumer-products-and-services-7333c43b2efc45168628b7fc244d8d58)

After hours on Tuesday and throughout the day on Wednesday the stock had a huge run up.  Towards the end of the day Tuesday and into after hours a sell off happened bringing the prices back to about where they started.  I also sold off all my options towards the peak of the prices.  Then bought more once the IV came back down.

HIMAXs actual earnings date is 5/5/2021.  I think because of the timing of the news release, most people weren’t able to get in on this event before the ramp up in price during after hours on Tuesday.  I believe a few days before earnings we’re going to see the same surge in the stock, possibly even bigger than Tuesdays since the earnings date is not surprise news.

This is not financial advice.  I’m just a smooth brained idiot.

mmkby4,,wallstreetbets,post,1617857504,"My non-technical SPY options scalping strategy1. I try to keep my trading only to 10am EDT to 11am (I’ve found that if I stay in much longer trades have a greater likelihood of turning against me).

2. I watch price action before I jump in to see where prices are bouncing around and identify a channel I can hop in to. I’ll check the chart but for some reason my brain processes the actual numerals better so I like to keep an eye on SPY % changes and share price change. For example, if it is bouncing between 0.02% and 0.06%.

3. One a price channel is identified, depending on timing, I’ll buy an in the money call or put for the closest expiry date. Based on my example, I would buy the call at 0.02% or the put at 0.06%. I’ve nearly lost my ass on 0 DTEs so I prefer to have at least a day to recover if the trade moves against me, but holding overnight is really less than ideal for so many different reasons, theta decay being #1.

3. I buy to open in multiples of 10 contracts and depending on price action I’m looking to capture a .05 or .10 movement in my favor. Sometimes this happens within 10 seconds and sometimes it is a few minutes. I only trade one lot at a time and once I buy to open I will immediately input a limit sell because the price action can be so fast you cannot rely on reaction time alone to capture profits. Also, if I miss my entry because things are moving quickly, I will wait for entry or take the other side of the price channel, or wait to identify a new channel.

4. Manage risk appropriately. Size trades appropriate to preferred risk levels. If the price action gets away from the target, sometimes patience can see through to a profit; it’s a personal decision to know when it’s time to take an L and close out. Don’t be greedy or you’ll get burned.

mma2th,,wallstreetbets,post,1617824258,"[Day Trading] Found this absolute fucking gem on the internet describing exactly what counts as a day trade and how you can get diddled by the PDT fairy if you're broke (sub $25k) and not careful. Educate yourselves, or don't. I probably don't even have enough karma to even get this posted 🍌 

# What are ""Day Trades"" and how are they counted?

Tip: Read from the bottom up if you want the juiciest examples first

A day trade is buying and selling the same security on the same day in a margin account. Day trades are counted based on the opening transaction and whether that opening transaction was closed out on the same day. Partial fills are not counted as multiple trades on the opening or closing side. However, if part of your order fills, and then you modify it and the rest fills, that may be counted as two day trades.

Examples of day trading:

* On Tuesday, 100 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that same day, 100 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be a day trade.


* On Monday, 10 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that same day, 5 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be a day trade.


* On Thursday, 50 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. On Friday, another 50 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that Friday, 50 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be one day trade.


* On Wednesday, 100 shares of XYZ are purchased. Later that same day, you sell 50 shares of XYZ and before the market close you sell another 50 shares of XYZ. This is one day trade. In this case, even though you sold your 100 shares of XYZ in two separate transactions, it still counts as one day trade because one single opening transaction was closed out.


* On Monday, 50 shares of XYZ are purchased. Later that day, another 50 shares of XYZ are purchased. Before the market close on Monday, 100 shares of XYZ are sold. This is two day trades. Here, we have two opening transactions closed by a single sell order. The first group of 50 shares of XYZ was bought and sold on the same day, and a second group of 50 shares was also bought and sold on the same day.


* On Friday, you put in 2 buy orders of 50 shares of XYZ. You then sell 51 shares of XYZ later that day. This is also two day trades. All 50 shares from the first opening transaction were bought and sold on the same day. One share from the second opening transaction was bought and sold on the same day. Even though only one share from Order 2 was sold, the purchase and sale of that single share in a single trading day counts as a day trade.


* On Wednesday, 3 orders are made: Buy 2 shares of XYZ, Buy 5 shares of XYZ, and Buy 50 shares of XYZ. Later that same day, an order to Sell 50 shares of XYZ is made. This is three day trades. We pair the closing transaction with the opening orders during that trading day, beginning with the earliest time of execution. This means you closed out all of opening Order 1, all of opening Order 2 and part of opening Order 3, resulting in **three day trades.**",

mmgk4q,,wallstreetbets,post,1617843969,"BABA $350 share - Charlie Munger just bought shares!It caught my eye that Charlie Munger (long-time partner to Warren Buffet) just bought BABA. Buffet and Munger had avoided technology for most of their careers before they hit a home run with AAPL. Its unusual to see these old guys buying into tech stocks, so I dug in and did a quick sum-of-the-parts analysis. Here is what I came up with, would love to get any feedback in case I am missing something.

* Core China eCommerce biz has 60% of all eCommerce in China. This is a highly profitable cash cow - approx. $250/share using a 25x P/E.
* Other China retail including leading grocery co Hema and stake in HK-listed Alibaba Health – approx. $20/sh
* Net Cash - approx. $20/share
* Stake in Ant Financial at ½ the valuation prior to canceled IPO  - approx. $20/share
* AliCloud – leading cloud company akin to the AWS of China - approx. $20/share
* All others – Eleme (Meituan competitor), Lazada (leading SE Asia eComm co), Cainiao logistics, Alibaba.com wholesale biz, Yoku online video, etc. - $20+/share
* Add all this up and total value/share is approx. $350/sh.
* Stock closed at $225, so \~65% of sum-of-the-parts, or in other words, we have 55% upside.

Alibaba appears to have a collection of growing/compounding businesses, so not only do you get short-term appreciation to sum-of-the-parts, but also good growth of the sum-of-the-parts. This can easily become a 200-300% return in \~2 years or less.",['AAPL']

mm8437,,wallstreetbets,post,1617818858,"Why PSFE is a GREATLY undervalued and overlooked stock. 3X candidate according to analyst Steve Grasso.**Introduction to Paysafe (PSFE):**

Paysafe Limited is a digital commerce company. Paysafe has its users in more than 120 countries across the United States, Canada and Europe to conduct commerce across online, mobile, in-application and in-store channels. The Company is focuses on iGaming, including online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games and Emerging Markets, which includes stock, FX and trading, direct marketing, which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods.

&#x200B;

**Quick and easy:**

Paysafe is a fin-tech company that just got out of a SPAC-merger, which immediately reeks given the recent SPAC-hype but HEAR ME OUT.

&#x200B;

**Why did they go public via SPAC?**

These days a lot of companies go public via SPACs. In PSFE’s case, already a big established company, this has allowed them to go a little under the radar. The only reason they went public via SPAC is because of a $9B agreement with Bill Foley to go public through Trasimene Acquisition Corp. II (BFT). This saved them from the bureaucratic process of going public through an IPO.

&#x200B;

**If they’d do an IPO, they would be a lot more covered by mainstream media and a conservative average for their IPO would probably be closer to $48.45.**

&#x200B;

**Here are EV/Revenue ratios of comparable companies, and PSFE equivalent at current levels:**

⁃ PayPal : 12.8x - 16x (based on PT) >>> PSFE: $26.67 - $33.33

⁃ Repay : 13.75x -> PSFE: $28.65

⁃ Affirm: 32.2x -> PSFE: $67.08

⁃ Nuvei : 40x -> PSFE: $83.33

⁃ Adyen : 18.6x -> PSFE: $38.75

⁃ Square : 11.2x -> PSFE: $23.33

⁃ Shift 4 : 11x -> PSFE: $22.91

⁃ [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : 84x -> PSFE: $175

⁃ Stripe : 52.8x -> PSFE: $110

⁃ Chime : 50x -> PSFE: $104

⁃ Checkout : 150x -> PSFE: $312

Average (excluding outlier Checkout): $75.54

Conservative Average (excluding all above $100): $48.45

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

Also, PayPal and SQ doesn’t have the risk assessment that Paysafe has got. Paysafe is one of the biggest payment providers in EU with their Paysafecards and online payment solutions, it is essentially an anonymous payment solution that anyone can use. This is BIG, especially in gambling. But also for kids that just want to go to the shop, buy a Paysafecard and redeem it for Fortnite skins. Paysafe has got a moat.

Paysafe is one of the most prominent payment providers in the booming iGaming industry. I can’t see how this is not a no-brainer at this price.

mmb96x,,wallstreetbets,post,1617827479,"The Market is Near Fucked at This PointThere are a few outliers that have particularly showed up today that causes me some concern.

1.	⁠We had a slew of great data on the economic front. Record high job momentum. Possibly new spending on infrastructure. A populous looking to spend money. All of this is a positive but the market tanked over the last two days. The 10-year yields haven’t moved either which is definitely worrying. You should be very worried that they haven’t moved. What this is saying is that in lieu of rates not moving, the market has already priced in the economic boom. So there isn’t much upside left.
2.	⁠Main Street boom will happen without a hitch. The market went up last year because it factored that in. If you remember 2020, people lost jobs and government fiscal and monetary policy alleviated what COULD have happened in 2021, 2022, and 2023. It was not for only 2020.
3.	⁠QE was start tightening much more rapidly than you expect. A stronger stranglehold over the Fed’s purse means the cost of borrowing goes up and business expansion slows down, leading to shrinking margins for high growth stocks that have already been projected. This means that companies will not hit their estimate earnings and reduce their stock price.

The market is frothy. You all had a good ride, but there is more downward pressure on stock performance at this point. The economy will boom. We will see a mouthwatering GDP growth. But consider that the stock market is overweight on high growth tech and other bubbles. When it sells, it’ll ruin the whole bunch. This impending collapse will only correct stocks while Main Street will have their time in the Sum.

Edit: CORRECTION- The market did not tank over the last two days. However, intraday trading is hovering around ATH for the past two days with a booming economy looming on the horizon. If it hasn’t moved up since then, it’s deciding where to go. Usually ATH either go up steadily with lots of volatility or it crashes.",

6. TLRY earnings on 05/10

In additional to those upcoming catalysts🚀🚀🚀, I think it’s important to note that TLRY hasn’t seen these lows (04/07/21) since (02/02/21).

Tilray’s most recent earnings report: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210217005982/en/Tilray-Inc.-Reports-2020-Full-Fiscal-Year-and-Fourth-Quarter-Results

Most recent catalyst: http://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/30/new-york-state-senate-passes-bill-to-legalize-recreational-weed.html

Current position: TLRY 04/23 25c

mm9n4c,gtq1q1t,wallstreetbets,comment,1617823465,"You missed the most important catalyst. Stifel lowered earnings expectations, and then raised their target. They are trying to get a lower entry point before earnings, which should cause the stock to go up.

Another overlooked point: TLRY is incorporated in the US, so once weed is legalized in the US they can begin operation here, even without acknowledging sweetwater.",
