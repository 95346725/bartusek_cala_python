m93gtj,grkrl8n,stocks,comment,1616235000,"Does someone have a logical take on what the fuck is actually going on with GME? There's still so much weird shit going on it feels like. If anyone wants to chime in, I'd love some opinions (please no ape strong together or conspiracy stuff) on the following things:

* why was part of the last congress hearing cut out by CNBC? Even if they were shills for Citadel, what was so problematic with that part? And if it wasn't, why was it cut out anyway?
* How the fuck is GME staying over 200 for so long with ""nothing sketchy going on""? Why did it even go up again? And why was there a battle around $200 dollars? I've been investing for ten years (mostly in local markets and conservative stuff like managed funds etc.), and I've never seen anything quite like the last few minutes of yesterday...
* Why do people talk about ""low volume""? Volume is still multiples higher on GME than it was before January, so volatility is actually still to expect. But then again, how can it be that there are hard price drops and breakouts with (relatively) low volume? Wouldn't lower volume result in a steady and slow pullback? Or is volume high enough to cause such violent drops and breakouts?
* While we're at it, what was up with AMC yesterday? It's rare to see a stock flatline like that, when it has actual volume?
* why in the world are there people literally brigading the shit out of every GME thread, writing multiple comments telling people to sell for their own sake and shit? Why would anyone care so much about strangers on the internet losing money to get so militant/aggressive? Is it just negative karma farming? Trolling? Or butthurt people that lost money and are now on angry crusades?
* Why the fuck would DFV stay in his position for so long? He could have walked away with 50+ million? I love the guy just for the memes, but that is insanity.  Do you think he sold by now? I know it doesn't matter, just curious.
* are there any 'organic' reasons that could explain what happened in the last few weeks? I know there's this theory that some whale pushed the stock up again and other whales fighting against that. If yes, I'd guess that fight is over and that's why it's dropping with low volume. But if that's whats happened, why did so many days end with photo finishes around particular prices? Is there still whales fighting about something? Or is it actually retail buying at certain key points, because they think ""oh no, it's 199, ape together strong, buy buy buy""? But if that's true, why does price always drop right before market close (yesterday it was 201.40 and trending upwards, when at 30 seconds before close, it violently dropped to 199 before closing right at 200.27 after a pushback)?
* Is there any world in where retail actually **does** hold most of the float and this shit could still blow up? Last I saw, there was ~40% of the float shorted. Does the number even matter? Wasn't VW only 12%? 

Anyway, I'd love some civil (and non-elitist) discussion about all this, because I can't really make sense of all of it. I like GME, mostly because I made around $8000 bucks in the first rally and it was fun (and stressful), but I'm not attached to it like most of WSB or detached and acting like it doesn't exist like people in other subs. I still have 11 shares left for the fun of it.

But fuck me, all of this is stupid, isn't it!

EDIT: fixed some grammar and deleted some ""actually""s, I use that word way too often, lul",

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Since then I put in $6,500 into various stocks, lost some and gained some. Eventually, recently, reorganized my portfolio and mostly deal with VTI, QQQ, and AAPl (80%,10%,10% respectively). I originally wanted to regain the $2,200 I lost, was looking for money in the short term. Get rich quick.

Either there is a fear of a bubble, there's a fear of a correction, there are sell offs, now everyone is worried about bond yields. The market dips 1 percent and everyone starts worrying about a collapse. Then people worry about oil prices. Politics also come into play.

m8j177,grhqqhi,stocks,comment,1616169677,"Someone I spoke to recently put this quite nicely - A lot of newer investors are not patient enough to hold onto a company that is doing better fundamentally than their stock price. There seems to be a sentiment among some that if the market is not recognizing a firms value, then that firm must be dead. But we see it time and time again, the market goes through periods of euphoria where lots of disruptive and emerging technologies sweep up investors in a wild ride based on promises of future profits 5-10 years down the line. All the talk is ""disruption, tech, new paradigm, etc."". Then inevitably the market turns and companies with REAL CASH FLOWS and good balance sheets come back into favor. These are the investments that do well long-term - companies that have steady and increasing cash flow. This was Buffett's genius - if you pick a couple great companies that will be around for 20-30 years, they can increase cash flows over that time at eye-watering amounts. And that cash eventually gets returned to the investor by dividends, buybacks, and the market recognizing the hidden value that may not have been priced into the multiple. This is not even simply value investing - the best growth investors found great companies with positive cash flows that were able to grow over long periods. I use the term cash flows so many times in this post because when you look at the market long-term (in 20-30 year periods) - CASH FLOW IS NEARLY THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS!",

m8xs17,grka4g5,stocks,comment,1616217332,"Ok.  I'll be the bear here.  You can downvote me later.  I'll try to be as mean and as bearish as possible.

Disclaimer: I like Tesla.  I respect Musk for innovating in areas where everyone else scoffed at and dismissed.  I respect that.  It's improving society and the world.

Bear Case:

This is all just getting ridiculous and too much.  Investing needs to return to reality.  It will be better for everyone.

How do you even begin to value a software, car, insurance, battery, ride-hail service company?  What margins do you use?  What revenues?  Do you take the high margins from software and combine them with the massive revenues of automotive?

It's like a forecast of the Frankenstein monster company; stitched together with the best pieces of each sector.  Should we also add in dividend projections from the utility sector for Tesla's solar farm business?

All of this is just getting too crazy and makes less practical sense each day.  A company like this has never existed in human history!  But this time is different?  Why?  Because a fund manager who is hemorrhaging money (and - for great emphasis - not projected to hemorrhage money in the *future* \- but, is hemorrhaging money *today*) needs it to be true?  Because she is trying to save face before her whale clients pack up and leave?

Also, I thought they forecasted self driving to be live and in use across society by 2018.   And that failed.  I thought they were re-projecting a minimum of 10+ more years to solve the harder problems of dealing with visual impairments like snow and rain?  It's why most of the testing is stuck in the blue sky of Nevada and Arizona.  I think all the easy AI problems got solved 10 years ago - only the super hard ones are left.

And why do they believe Tesla is the most probable company to deliver this technology?  I don't know; I like Tesla and all, but, are they really going to beat Google, Amazon, and Apple in an AI tech race?  That seems highly improbable actually - not probable.

And then, there's this argument that Tesla is so far ahead of the other auto manufacturers; which is a true and factual statement.  However, it is not the complete picture.  The other auto manufacturers are always behind in technology.  They choose to be this way.  When the new inventions and technologies mature and arrive, they work out deals with the patent holders for the rights to put the tech in their cars.  They've always done this.  They are essentially outsourcing large portions of R&D.

So, what happens if just about any other company in the world discovers and patents important EV and self driving technologies other than Tesla?

In addition, another more prudent question is: Is Tesla beating Google and other silicon valley start-ups in AI and EV?  I don't think the answer to that question is obvious at all.  I think Tesla might actually be behind Google!  Waymo looks pretty promising.  And this goes back to the Frankenstein company dilemma.  You are rating the tech strength in Tesla to the tech strength in an auto company - which everyone already knows is weighted in favor of Tesla.  But, you are not punishing the Tesla valuation for its small revenues when compared to a true, auto giant.

(And, again, I really like Tesla - but I think the current share price is much, much risker than a lot of people realize.  They really need to deliver multiple world changing innovations at scale.)","['TSLA', 'UPS', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL']"

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
> The bond market’s reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell’s briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
> “This is bonds’ — I wouldn’t call it day in the sun — it’s more like day in the tornado,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “Clearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that’s not the case.”
*****
> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “The bond move has been huge, and it’s starting to scare people,” said Schumacher.
*****
> “There’s been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?” he asked. “There’s no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It’s incredible.”
*****
> # Powell speaks
*****
> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
> # Inflation and the Fed
> There is also some key data.
*****
> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank’s forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year’s numbers when prices fell.
*****
> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It’s a change to the Fed’s ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
> “For the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there’s a consensus problem. There can’t not be tension,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> “They will be trying to clarify the Fed’s message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,” she said. “They will be explaining themselves as economists, and they’ll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.”
*****
> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
> “The market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed’s dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,” said Grohowski.
*****
> “Yet, they’re committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,” he said. “That’s what the market is struggling with. I think it’s unsettling to me to hear words like ‘overshoot.’”
*****
> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‘great rotation’ from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
> “I think we’re in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It’s not over, but I think we’ve seen the lion’s share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,” said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed’s willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike’s comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
> “Inflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,” Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year’s earnings.”
*****
> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed’s economic forecast.
*****
> “If you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It’s too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,” Grohowski said.
*****
> # Bond market direction
> Schumacher said there’s a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

In fact, only the ’29 crash, the ’87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn’t do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we’ve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we’ll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
> So what happens now is the logical question? “The good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although it won’t be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls’ side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.”
*****
> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
> “Global growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators” according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “When we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.”

*****
> “The level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country’s below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.

*****
> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country’s relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January’s 0.5% pace.
*****
> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI’s value.
*****
> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite’s growth, while manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.

*****
> “In recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.”
*****
> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*

*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*

**Let's begin:**

1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..
2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.
3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.

&#x200B;

\--

Ok, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:

**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are ""undervalued"" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)

\-OR-

**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an ""investors"" path. This is a ""speculators"" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)

\--

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:

1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!
2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.
3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!
4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:

1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.
2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.
3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.
4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.

I hope this post will help some of you.

This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

If anyone needs to chat - by all means shoot me a note. Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reviewing the company’s plans for a direct listing, an alternative to a traditional initial public offering.

A representative for Coinbase declined to comment.

This week, Coinbase’s backers registered for as many as 114.9 million shares to trade when the stock lists. In a direct listing, investors can begin selling their holdings as soon as a company starts trading rather than waiting for the expiration of a lockup period -- typically up to six months in an IPO.

Investment firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures are among those whose shares could trade, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam have also registered stock.

Coinbase shares have changed hands at $200 to $375.01 in private transactions this year, the filing shows. The volume-weighted average price per share for transactions from January through March 15 was $343.58, which would give Coinbase a public market valuation of about $67.6 billion, based on the total number of shares outstanding as of Monday. The fully diluted value -- including employee incentive plans and restricted stock units -- would be significantly higher.

The debut will be the first major direct listing to take place on the Nasdaq. All such previous listings were on the New York Stock Exchange, including those by Spotify Technology SA, Slack Technologies Inc., Asana Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Roblox Corp., which listed this month.

Coinbase’s latest financial statements revealed that the company is making money, setting it apart from many other startups when they make their public debuts. Coinbase swung from a loss to a profit of $322 million last year on net revenue that more than doubled to $1.14 billion.

Neither person involved are professionals or financial advisors.

What are the legalities there? It *feels* like nothing is illegal or wrong ethically or morally, but my science brain wants 3rd party opinion and discussion because I'd rather not even accidentally be involved in financial crimes or whatnot.

If she were to slap down $100 buckos each month and say ""Put this into your account, under [$CARZ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/CARZ) and [$BJK](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/BJK), and we'll see what happens?"" could there be potential ass-bitings in the future from black-suited gentlemen on the behalf of a government agency?

She's 58, on disability and has health issues. I suspect she may be trying to avoid disclosure to her boyfriend - which I don't think is a problem because they aren't married or jointly contracted to anything such as properties or loans - and also because I think *she thinks* that she's going to die soon, but I'm hesitant to move forward because I just can't figure out any legal standings on the matter; probably because I'm a google dipshit.

This is in Texas, and I guess for disclosure I hold VTI, VXUS, VNQ, BND, BNDX and a few solo stocks like Ford (I like the stock) and SIRI (A friendly wager with a friend on whether Sirius or XM radio stocks would take off, they ended up merging as SiriusXM and I hold one share as a fond memory).

I want to help, and she is dead-set on not opening her own brokerage account but rather 'gifting' said money over to be invested on her behalf in my own account.

I mean, my friend's. .............

I've spoken with her about her decision to take BJK and CARZ instead of say, VOO or the Qs and her literal response was ""I like Cirque Du Soleil and casinos, but don't want to gamble. Also cars are cool."" so I think it boils down to her version of 'I just like the stocks.' I've brought up the options of an HSA or even an ABLE account, but.. I'll be honest. This woman spent the 70's and 80's, even up to today, at biker bars hustling people on pool tables. If she tells a man ""No"" then not even a thunderbolt from God can change her mind.

So I guess the TLDR is, 'is it legal for someone to invest a relative's money on a relative's behalf in their own brokerage while not being a professional' and ""would said individuals needs to draft any documentation to prevent legal fuckery in the future?""",['GOOGL']

**Competition**

There are competitors in the field of AR glasses, but none come close to the size that Vuzix has as Vuzix is a field leader. Most competitors sell inferior products (either heavier/thicker, provide inadequate support, or use inferior technology). Vuzix is also a market leader in revenue for AR glasses. 

This is a very niche environment that few have been able to enter, so Vuzix has a strong grasp on future growth.

**Analysts and Estimates**

Vuzi is currently rated a Buy with an average target price of $31.67 (low of $30 and high of $35). An EPS estimate of -$0.27 is given for next year, which would half the current EPS.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI/analysis/

**Risks**

Although not likely, they can dilute their shares again if needed. They are currently sitting on over $40 million in cash, so they won’t need to, but it is definitely a possibility in the future.

As Vuzix is not a startup and is still cash flow negative by a large margin, they need to improve their scalability and increase profits to be seen as a viable company for future investors.

As Vuzix has not made a profit, rising interest rates could hurt them when they need to take out loans to maintain business (not likely as they have plenty of cash on hand).

**Technical Analysis**

This is my own analysis, so take with however much salt you like.

Vuzi has been on an explosive uptrend the last few days after having been beaten the past few weeks. They have maintained themselves in the upper BB for quite some time (although it is widening), and their 10 EMA and 20 EMA has held very steadily. The MACD signal line crossed mid-February signalling a buy and it has maintained a healthy divergence. Their recent price action increase has them slightly overbought, but not necessarily a sell (at least not to me). 

Current support and resistance around $29.50, $25, $23.80, $21, and $19 (although will most likely not be maintained). More realistic support and resistance around $26, $22, $21, $19.50, $18, and $15.50.

Another thing I noticed is their volume fluctuation on drastic green days vs drastic red days. Drastic green day volume typically has twice the volume of normal and high red days, but red days have a much steeper price change on lower volume. Not sure what to make of that. Maybe people are holding? Maybe the volume is being diluted across multiple days? Not sure.

My buy range is between $18 and $23 (this does not mean it will reach these prices again, and does not mean it will rebound once it does). My current rating is a hold until (if) it reaches these prices again.

**Final Thoughts/TL;DR**

Vuzix is a long-term buy for me, but not at the current price. AR glasses are the future, and I believe they are able to establish themselves in this niche sector. Their products, although not revolutionary, are far beyond the competition and provide excellent ROI for the companies that utilize them. Once they're able to scale up, they will be worth much more than they are now.

I have a current rating of hold until (if) it reaches my buy range of $18-$23 where I plan to buy more. I do believe a pullback from the recent jump is due, but not necessarily guaranteed. I strongly believe in this company and its experienced and well-vested board to increase revenue and push the company into a multi-billion dollar state compared to its current valuation of around $1 billion.

I currently hold 25 shares at $23.50 that I’ve been holding for a month (talk about bad timing) as a means to include it into my portfolio and continuously check the price.","['MS', 'IR', 'GPS', 'NDAQ', 'TGT', 'BAC', 'STT', 'USB', 'HD', 'BLK', 'INTC']"

m8ukjr,,stocks,post,1616197841,"GAW (Warhammer) & Cineworld Group DD (X-posted from r/investing)# ***Disclaimer, positions and reasoning for post.***

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know. 

**Positions:**

I have a handful of shares in Cineworld Group (CWD/CNNWF) and am considering investing in both Games Workshop Group (GAW/GMWKF) and Brewdog, when it eventually IPOs.

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

I truly feel as though I've found a home in terms of where I need to go for advice/community information/input. You can't learn if you don't put yourself out there, and I've done just that today, and the information I've gained is invaluable. Thanks again.  

EDIT2: Yes, I am aware now that I'm too far spread out. We're fixing that.  

__________  

Hey y'all. So I'm basically brand new to investing - I've dicked around on Robinhood before years ago, but never anything serious. I grew up in poverty and am only just finding my way out, so investment is still quite new but incredibly exciting to me.  

Yesterday, I took $500 and put it into the market. Here's what I bought. I plan on holding all pretty much until it's either time to retire or until daddy's gotta make a purchase. My logic behind choosing tickers was as follows:  

1) The index is too important to miss, and as I've said elsewhere, a 14% annual return over a lifetime feels much better than jumping off a cliff. **The indexes I chose are FTEC, QQQ, SCHA, SPY, VOO, VGT, and VUG.**   

2)Dividends are probably the most important aspect of a long term single stock hold IMO, closely followed by overall stability/growth projections. You don't need much inherent growth with dividend stocks, they just can't dip too far or else you're breaking even. Even if the stock itself stays even, you'll still compound your way ahead. **The dividend paying stocks I chose are AMCR, HBAN, HPE, KEY, PEP, T, and TM.** PEP and TM could arguably fall under other categories, but they both pay respectable dividends and are staple companies which will likely exist until the end of the current world, so they're on the list.    

-And finally, I chose one stock that I consider to be a knock off version of a growth stock. It has the growth potential, but it also has the dividend to boot, and really I'm looking at **TROW** and trying to find something wrong with the stock, but I can't. So TROW it is.  

To preemptively answer some questions:  

-I diversified within ETFs for two reasons; first, because it means more money overall within the indexes, and second because they'll all perform decently enough, but it's likely one or two might outperform the others, and I want in on those.  

-I chose AMCR because it's been rock steady for as long as the Earth has been round, and the dividend is unreal. I chose T for similar reasons, although T also falls under ""buy what you use"" in my case.  

-To me, HPE was the biggest ""risk"" in this portfolio, just because there's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that it will grow drastically from its current status. However, again, HPE isn't going anywhere any time soon, it's recovering somewhat decently from the pandemic crash, and the dividend is still there. As long as I don't lose ~15% or more on price over the long term, I should still be in good shape.  

So yeah. I sure feel like a monkey making and describing these decisions, but I wonder how bad or good these decisions actually are. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED talk.  

EDIT: In the brief time this has been up I've learned quite a bit more, which is honestly typical /r/stocks (thanks). What I'm learning is that I need to pay a little closer attention to what exactly each ETF follows, and that I possibly over-diversified. Apparently I'm still trading with technically unsettled funds, so once everything settles I'll look at making some corrective decisions. Thanks again.","['HPE', 'TROW', 'AMCR', 'PEP', 'HBAN']"

m8q2df,,stocks,post,1616185134,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

m8tj0f,,stocks,post,1616194687,"DD on RFP: A lumber value play poised to have its best Q earnings in a decade due to surge in lumber prices.For the last few months, I was looking for how to play this insane surge in lumber prices and if any of the lumber companies were still a good value play. The larger companies (WFG and WY) seemed to have their profits priced in and have been trading sideway for months.

So a friend pointed me to RFP: Resolute Forest Products.  I did a deep dive on the company and thought I'd share it.  RFP is up 41% YTD (as of close on 3/19/31), up 479% for the last year (as of close on 3/19/21).  When you look at the company’s history and metrics, it starts to make sense why its stock price has grown so much recently and why it probably still will.  

For reasons articulated below, it appears on track to release its best earnings statement in at least decade on April 29 this year, and if commodity prices hold, Q2 should be even better given that home builders project higher volume in Q2 than Q1..

**Brief History Description**

RFP is a Canadian paper/pulp/forestry company that used to gain a majority of its revenue from newsprint and specialty paper.  In the late 2000’s, the company had way too much debt and with the huge decline in print journalism, it lost a lot of its largest source of income.  They went into bankruptcy in the late 2000’s and came out of it December 2010 and changed their name to Resolute Forest Products.  Over the last decade the company has been trying to transform itself, building up its lumber and pulp production capacities while consolidating paper production and paying down debt.

The only decent year they had was 2018.  Their Q2 earnings (Net GAAP Income of 72 million; $.72 EPS;) was the best quarter they had had in years.  And the market reaction was pretty dramatic. Here’s the graph ([LINK](https://imgur.com/a/yjj3tqi?)) with the earnings dates circled.  From March to September, the stock doubled in value; a majority of that price increase occurring in the span of six weeks starting with the Q2 earnings announcement.  

What made Q2 so good? Lumber had a small surge in price in the middle of Q2, as did wood pulp.  ([graph of lumber futures](https://imgur.com/gallery/Q1r1Nbm)).  Nothing compared to now, but it was significant at the time.

RFP’s Q3 was even better, with a net income of 117 million, an EPS of $1.25, and a special dividend of $1.50/share.  However, the price of lumber dropped like a rock before Q3 earnings, and so the stock started going down with it.  However, that Q3 announcement got a 25% stock price jump in a day.

**Present Day Conditions**

2020 was a rough year for RFP.  Their paper segment EBIDTA was ~85% less than 2019 due to the pandemic which caused a huge drag on their annual income and luckily has kept this company under the radar compared to some of the larger forestry companies that don’t produce paper.  

That being said let’s look at their valuation ratios based on 2020 income (As of 3/19/21):

    **RFP**
    P/E				85.75
    Forward P/E		5.50
    Price/Sales		.27
    Price/Book		.77
    Price/Cash flow	4.25

I won’t even put up the SP 500 valuation ratios because it doesn’t make sense to compare them. (But if you care, SP 500 numbers are substantially more overvalued than RFP).  So let’s compare RFP to the Paper/pulp competitors’ average (in this I used tickers GLT, MERC, CLW, NP, and UFS) [Link for Schwab comparison](https://imgur.com/gallery/IX7hCrn):

    **Paper/Pulp**
    P/E			      31.68
    Forward P/E		12.86
    Price/Sales		.724
    Price/Book		2.138
    Price/Cash flow	18.676

The P/E is high however when you look the others’ in the link you’ll see only two of those paper/pulp companies had positive earnings last year.  MERC, NP and UFS, were negative earnings thus had no positive PE.  Despite that, RFP still has a better forward PE than these other companies. From a valuation metric, RFP seems to have the best forward outlook and by far the most undervalued.  Now let’s compare RFP’s ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, UFPI, and IFSPF) ([Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/kADg2st)):

    Forestry/Lumber Avg
    P/E				15.13
    Forward P/E		14.04
    Price/Sales		1.76
    Price/Book	       3.83
    Price/Cash flow	11.4
		
Compared to the other major lumber companies, RFP again has the best forward looking PE and is undervalued as compared to other similar industry players’ price to book and price to sales metrics.  The stock could double form its current value and it still would be undervalued compared to its competitor.  That probably explains why RFP has been performing better, price wise, than any of the larger companies:

RFP—41% YTD, 80% 6-Months, 479% 1-yr

WFG—2%, 23%, 229%	    

WY—1%, 22%, 108%

In terms of why RFP is still flying under the radar, first, they are a company that had not been doing well for years, have been turning it around for the last decade while refocusing their main sources of income.  That takes time and money which mutes their true earnings once those one times costs disappear.  So their 10-year graph and historic earnings reports are not pretty.  

Second, because of how badly the pandemic hit their paper segment, it has hidden the growing EBIDTA run rate from their lumber and pulp segments.  So their earnings are much less than the forestry companies, while being much higher than the other paper companies of comparable size to RFP.

Lastly, any time the major financial media companies (Like CNBC) discuss the lumber surge, they either suggest people invest in Home Depot / Lowes, Lumber Liquidators or the largest forestry companies, WY and WFG, which already have their future profits priced in.  So those investors who do whatever the talking heads tell them to do, they are going to miss stocks like RFP.

**The Bullish Case for 2021**

As of right now, the average analyst projection for Q1 is 1.26 EPS. Let’s look at RFP’s yearly GAAP Net income / EPS for the last decade:

    RFP 	Net Inc. GAAP	EPS
    2011   	   41	              0.42
    2012	        -2	              -0.02
    2013	        -639	        -6.75
    2014	        -277	        -2.93
    2015	        -257	        -2.78
    2016	        -81	               -0.9
    2017	        -84	        -0.93
    2018	        235	         1.96
    2019	        -47	         -0.51
    2020	         10	               0.12

Meaning if RFP hits the average analyst estimate of 1.26 EPS, it’ll be the best quarterly EPS they’ve had in a decade, and almost last much earnings in their single best year in the last decade.  

And in all likelihood, these analysists may still be underestimating RFP’s earnings for 2021.  For example: Here is “RBC’s capital market issuer disclosure for its analyst’s [Paul Quinn] $1.16 EPS estimate for Q1 and 11$ price target:

“Valuation (2/5/2021): Our price target of $11 is based on a blended 5.5x EV/EBITDA multiple using our trend EBITDA of $250MM (weighted 85%) and our 2021 EBITDA estimate of $447MM (weighted 15%). Our target multiple is near the low end of the typical North American Paper and Forest Products trading range (5.0x to 8.0x), reflecting the company’s exposure to the declining newsprint/groundwood paper markets.”

In 2018, RFP produced 200 EBIDTA from the mini surge in lumber price, ([Link to Q4 Earnings Slide](https://imgur.com/gallery/QdCqSAv)) and the average transaction price for the year was $446 mbf.  The higher the price of lumber the higher the portions of those sales go to straight earnings.  

If lumber maintains an average transaction price of at least 800 (and it’s been trading over $1000 Since February), RFP is looking at possibly over 200 EBITDA for the quarter, much less for the year.  And that doesn’t include any extra earnings from pulp or paper.  So the analyst’s projection of a run rate of 250 EBITDA for the whole company for all of 2021, is grossly underestimating the earnings RFP will generate form these high lumber sales and suggests RFP will easily beat the Q1 projections.

No only is the price of lumber up, but RFP’s production capacity for lumber is also higher than 2018.  RFP’s 2020 purchase of 3 US sawmills have proven to be perfectly timed.  These mills have begun producing lumber at the start of 2021 and will be at 100% capacity by the end of Q2. (Google Q4 2020 Earnings Call transcript; link blocked by r/investing).  These three mills will roughly increase RFP’s total lumber production by 25%.  That is just extra production capacity at a time when it matters most, meaning much more earning potential than 2018.

As if that weren’t enough, wood pulp is has also surged to the highest price it has been in at least 3 years. ([Link to Shanghai Wood Pulp Futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21))  My guess is that this spike is in large part to China’s ban on single use non-degradable plastic, effective in major cities December 2020. ([LINK](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51171491).)  Because of this surge, RFP has announced multiple price increases to their wood pulp in the last four months, that would put transaction prices the highest they have been in multiple years. 

**Issues with RFP**

I think it’s important to always include any possible downsides.  Things to keep in mind, RFP, being a smaller market cap, is less likely to trade at valuation ratios like the largest companies.  So it is hard to predict when this company is trading at a true fair value.

Also, RFP still has a large amount of debt for their size, and some issues funding their pension.  They are paying it down, but this could also scare off some investors.  They don’t have as high of a return on equity/assets like some of it’s competitors, raising some concerns with the quality of management.  

RFP’s paper still is likely to historically underperform for another quarter or two.  The economy reopening back should bring back some revenue, however, because there are no futures markets for paper, this sector of the company is substantially harder to project.  
The stock itself is very volatile because it is a microcap.  There are probably many investors who avoid that type of volatility.

Lastly, because of its small volume/float size, the stock is more susceptible to market manipulation by the hedge funds or market makers.  So it probably wouldn’t be smart to play with short term calls. 

If you all identify more, I would love to hear it in case I’m missing something and need to readjust my perspective on this stock.

**Fun Tidbit:**

While I was looking into RFP, a buddy sent me these screenshots of Keith “DFV” Gill’s stock portfolio from his Roaring Kitty live streams in August 2020 ([Link](https://imgur.com/a/Qg3U2Ay))  and January 2021 ([Link](https://imgur.com/a/GIQJRd6)).  Apparently, the man REALLY knows how to pick ‘em.  RFP up at ~ 100% since that August video.

**TLDR**: This paper/lumber company spent the last decade turning things around.  It’s had the best price performance of any of the paper/forestry companies for the last year.  2021 Q1 earnings projected to be the best Q earnings in at least a decade, with Q2 likely to be better.   This is probably why Keith Gill has been holding it or looking at it for months.

With that said I’m biased. However, I’d recommend waiting until later in the day to buy. If Apple holds resistance at or above $118 it could be a bullish swap. Anything below, wait for $116 or lower.

I’m completely lost on how tax brackets work when someone is cashing out completely. Say someone has a taxable brokerage account, yet they never sell anything until the end. So annually they just get taxed on the dividends (?). Say they put in $10,000 per year, and their income is as follows, as far as years they worked: 

Years 2-4: $20,000/year.
Years 5-18: $50,000/year
Years 19-39: $76,000/year
Then they are going to retire soon but got a low paying job right before, so years 40-41: $19,000/year. Then they want to cash the whole thing out their 45th year, so the last few years of having the account, no work. 

If they cash the whole thing out, after depositing $10,000 annually after all of those years. It would definitely be a nice sum, say they put it into ETF’s in the S and P 1500.

m8odr7,,stocks,post,1616180418,"A Quick Read - Is your stock in the red?Hey everyone!!

Happy Friday! We’re halfway thru the month of March! Crazy, don’t you say?! 

The Techy-Wrecky is back again with the 10 year treasury yield up.. *woo-hoo* ... 

This means tech stocks are takin a *BEATING!*

You’re seeing red in your portfolio??

Well let’s go back to the first day you bought this stock... why on earth did you buy this stock? Do you believe in the company and its fundamentals, and growth in the long-term? ... or was it for some quick cash, the race to get rich quick..? 

The stock market always will have a good day, and a bad day.. literally like life - there’s good days, and bad days... in the end, all should be OK if you bought into a well established company... *yes, I know anything can happen at any given time* ...

Let’s say I bought Apple Stock. *I did, but lets take it for an example* ....

I purchased this for $137 usd , and it is now $120-125 range.... 

Should you sell??

The company hasn’t changed anything towards it, it’s just that these treasury yields are up... 

So it’s more of a buying opportunity to “buy the dip” . *This isn’t Financial Advice. Do your own DD, your capital is at risk.* 

First and foremost, lets take a look at this all..

—- Keep in mind , this is a long-ish read... read however much you want, comment if you want, or simply view it. — Plus , thank you for taking your time to read this! —- 

———- ••• ———— ••• ———— •• ——- • ———-

#The Mindset

1) We procrastinate buying certain stock at (x) price... so we go “we’ll buy that when its lower” WHILE HAVIN A PLAN, and doing research... 

2) We see it rise up and suddenly we think we have “missed out” — *FOMO* ...

3) a) It either rises up more, and more, and more... 

b) It rises up, tumbles all the way back down, and we freak out...

4) a) We can take our profits if we wish

b) We start worrying *oh my goodness, I’m losing money* ... and sometimes results in us selling stock.

*or*

1) We see a stock in an article , “this stock will make you ____ dollars in ____ years” or Jimmy Joe suggests “BUY THIS STOCK” 

2) You see stock, buy stock... NO PLAN, NO GOAL, blindfolded buying the stock... 

3) You see it go up ? Wow, you might’ve gotten lucky! *First ones free!* .... or you see it go down??

4) You say **F^ck JIMMY JOE!!** as he made you lose ____ dollars as you were holding ___ shares.... little do you know, Jimmy Joe has a plan of ____ years, ____ price target, and sees the full potential. 

———————-

**DO YOU NOTICE THAT?**

Why are you buying into a company YOU BELIEVE IN for a “good price” to you, and selling it off for less? 

It’s sheer utter panic.. “I’m losing money!! I have to sell!” 

... it’s not a loss until you sell it !!! 

It’s like buying a new house you fully renovated for 500k ... and selling it for 475k to a family friend ... or buying something new - literally anything - and selling it for cheaper... even though the stock is always “new” !!! 

———— ••• ————- ••• ———— 

#How to manage seeing red - a loss

**Please feel free to add whatever tips you have yourself down in the bottom, but I will list some of mine.** 

1) If you have high hopes, aren’t in need of money, you can let it slide... a bad day in the stock market will happen time to time. - it will always create buying opportunities, and good selling opportunities if you are patient. — **Only put money in you can afford to lose** — with certain stocks, or just in general. The Stock Market is no “Game” whatsoever, and viewing it this way can create an addiction.. 

2) **SET A STOP LOSS** - this should be number 1, but I will leave it as number 2. Why? Because if you are a long term investor, sometimes not having stop loss is your friend... imagine if your stop loss kicked in during March last year.... *the gold mine opportunity* ... you would have lost a LOT of money... and I’m sure everyone did during that time period... if you want a risky investment that you’re unsure of, don’t really know ... sure, a stop loss is great! It will allow you to buy stock of a company you actually really like.

3) Exercise. Walk around for a bit, do yoga, a workout, play Wii Fit , meditate... whatever to help your mind off the stress of “losing” money..  —- also helps by not even looking at your Trading App... do whatever else, do nothing if you really want!! Its okay to let your money work its on powers.... relax.. calm down! You are INVESTING or TRADING! You started a position in something you like which is better than none - and regretting it - and started trading/investing in the first place... which is REALLY beneficial in the long run!! — You just have to wait and see! 

4) Jot down the day, and price the stock reached on its low... sounds ridiculous, right? Not overly... if you do this with a stock, you will see that you can take a hard hit of a negative number... and its progression back up to where it regained... - do this with some of your favourite stocks, and you can see for yourself where a stock price remains as a “buy” for you and a “sell” for you... 

5) Know that everyone is losing money. Yes, you’re allowed to think of yourself, everyone has different capitals , risk tolerance, etc., ... but know it is not just you.. and we all are either losing a ton of money... or gaining... 

6) Last one - If you don’t believe in that company no longer, don’t like its fundamentals / something about it, need money, and “its a bust” because it hasn’t moved? Maybe that is when you should sell for a loss..

———————— •••• —————- •••• ——————

We all want to make money. We all want some profits from our stocks, but suddenly when we start putting our emotions into the stock market... it sometimes wins... and we sell low, and buy high... and lose a ton of money doing so... 

That won’t make you rich... it will give you a lesson that **sometimes** if you’re not patient enough, you will miss out on great opportunities.  

— But also, don’t be greedy. Greed will win over, and that stock will plummet, and you’ll be regretting yourself. Treat yourself to some profits... its OKAY to take profits!! 

Everyone makes mistakes in the market.

**OVERALL** - Stocks !! Stocks last FOREVER! even after you die!!! So if you buy something, see it a low? Replace your emotions, think positive... *I believe in this stock, this stock can reach my stock price of ____ and I will sell (x) shares* .... — ALWAYS, ALWAYS, have a PLAN when buying a stock!! 

What is your goal? .. and go after it! If you no longer believe in the company, something changes thats bad / you don’t like, sure! Cut them losses, or take those profits while you can!! Put it in something you believe in - or a well established company (blue chip) or simply an ETF... and life is good!! 

——— ••• ——— •• ——- •• ——— •• 

All in all, 

The stock market is a rollercoaster of emotions. People buy when they think its a good price to buy in, while others think its a good time to sell.... you have your plan... you stick to that plan... and everything should be okay! 

Happy Friday, everyone! 

Stock Market closes in an hour ... (not including after market) ... time to relax afterwards for the weekend!!

What are your guys’ plans? Let me know, down below!!

... and feel free to criticize, give feedback, and any other tips to help out others while seeing a loss! If there’s anything I missed, feel free to add that in, as well!!

Take care,

Hope all is going well!! Today is a GOOD DAY! What did you buy today?! Let me know down below! 

Sending positive vibes your way.

Stay safe, and as always

Happy Trading / Investing!

m8upum,grjr0rq,stocks,comment,1616204851,"(Disclaimer: I have no positions on Ehang and know nearly nothing about the company.)

I just skimmed their article.  I don't really see the problem.  This is actually the purpose of shorting and why it exists in finance.

This firms believes the company is aggressively over promoting itself and embellishing its financials - and maybe even committing fraud.

So, assuming the article is correct, this is great.  I don't want to accidently invest in a company that commits fraud.  In addition, fraudulent companies of all shapes and sizes deserve to be ground into the dust because they are a burden on the tax payers of the countries they operate in and they steal from their shareholders.

In addition, the beauty of finance is, if you disagree with the shorts' research, just start buying up all the shares.  And, if the company has a quality CFO, he/she will also recognize this and use the company's cash flows to pay dividends or to perform share buy backs which will shatter and explode any short positions.

Shorts have incredibly vulnerable positions.  When they are wrong, they can sometimes lose the entire firm.  So, if an activist short firm, which has a history of sniffing out fraud, is shorting a company you are long, you better triple check your research and really make sure you are investing in a quality company with honest management.

If the company is good, you have nothing to worry about.  The cash generation of the company will ultimately drive any shorts away.  If the company is fraudulent, however, the shorts are not the people stealing from you; the company's management are.",

I'd like to collar it with options - I know it limits my upside, but I''d like to protect and hedge against the downside as well. 

Would like your advice to see if I am thinking about this right.

SQ is trading around 224 right now.

Looking at the long term options chain for Sq for 2023, I see the following:

Sell a **SQ Jan 2023 300.000 call** for 41$ ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ230120C00300000?p=SQ230120C00300000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ230120C00300000?p=SQ230120C00300000))

Buy a **SQ Jan 2023 195.000 put for 42$ (**[**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ230120P00195000?p=SQ230120P00195000**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ230120P00195000?p=SQ230120P00195000)**)**

It is not entirely costless, but nearly. I need to pay \~800$ in difference + commission/brokerage.

With this collar, the worst case I can lose is 13% from today's value (224). And my upside is limited to 33.9%.  Is this accurate? This feels too good to be true to me, as the upside is 30%  while downside is only 13%. But I read that this is usually not the case when we try to collar. So what am I missing here?",

I could collect $40k now and either have the shares in a year if it closes below $230 or collect another $184,000 should it close above.

m8g5f8,,stocks,post,1616156927,"Peloton (PTON) DD and AnalysisI’ve only been studying stocks for the past year, and this is my first in-depth DD, so please feel free to point out mistakes or leave me constructive criticism.

**Warning:** This is very long, but there's a TL;DR at the end

**Disclosure:** I bought 18 shares at $113.8 halfway through doing my DD. I plan to buy more if the price drops below $100.

I’m long-term bullish, but I’ll be trying to look at the negatives too. I’ll be going over Peloton’s background and future goals, its target market, competitors, financials, and where I see it going in the long-term.

First, here’s a very basic overview of the bull vs. bear arguments on this stock as I see them.

**Bull Hypothesis**: Peloton will be the future of connected fitness, essentially becoming the Netflix of the fitness world. It will dominate in the commercial gym and higher-income market as well as among fitness buffs, and it will also branch into the lower-income market/casual exercisers taking a section of that market share also.

**Bear Hypothesis:** Peloton’s stock price is grossly overhyped, and its PE ratio is unreal. This is a pandemic stock, and after we recover from the pandemic, it’s going to come crashing down to reality. Other big competitors such as Apple will undercut Peloton preventing it from dominating the market. Or, there will be so many competitors that no single company will gain significantly. Either way, Peloton can’t sustain these levels and will crash long-term.

Arguments for bullish stance:

1. At-home exercise has increased and will continue to increase thanks to the convenience and cheaper cost compared to a gym, and therefore, Peloton will continue to grow as a company over the coming years.

2. Covid will have more people going back to the gym gradually, but many will still be more cautious, and still others will have already bought into the at-home fitness system. Some will use a hybrid of gym and at-home workouts.

3. Peloton is looking to become established in gyms. If they are able to succeed in this, it would make people more likely to subscribe to their app personally as well.

4. The health and wellness industry is valued at 6,033.2 billion dollars, so there is plenty of room for growth for this stock. Peloton is branching out into apparel, and will likely also do nutritional products in the future. Subscriptions, apparel, and nutritional products are going to greatly increase revenue.

Arguments for bearish stance:

1. Peloton will not continue to grow after covid, or it will grow at a much slower level which will drop the stock value over the next 1-2 years. Right now the stock value is overblown and needs to be brought back down to a reasonable level based on its current financials.

2. People enjoy going to the gym and once covid is over, they will be happy to go back, and at-home fitness will stagnate.

So, a quick overview. Peloton is an 8-year old company that founded the pairing of gym equipment with online workout classes. It started with a bike and cycling classes. The idea is that you buy the bike (fitted with a screen) and subscribe to a monthly membership that gives you access to livestream or recorded classes, allowing you to exercise at home. You can track things like your heart rate and compare your progress to others via the leaderboard. There’s also a community/social media element to it wherein you can follow other people to see their profile/workout progress, video chat with friends, send people virtual high-fives to support them, etc.

The CEO, John Foley, is a health nut who founded Peloton after he didn't want to fork out for a personal trainer. He found classes better, but as he got busier didn't have time to attend. That's how he came up with the concept.

The aim of Peloton is to create an online version of real-world gym classes without the hassle of going there or paying as much for the membership/fitness classes. Currently, Peloton is branching out into other gym equipment. They have brought out a treadmill, and in December 2020 they acquired a fitness equipment maker, Precor (one of the world’s largest suppliers of commercial equipment), indicating they plan to make a variety of equipment adapted to their concept. They also provide a subscription-only service which allows people on a budget to exercise without the expensive equipment, and they also provide classes that don’t need any equipment at all (e.g. yoga, body workouts).

&#x200B;

* **Target Market**

Peloton has started out aiming at a higher-income market as well as serious fitness buffs. According to the CEO, this is because they knew their equipment was too expensive to appeal to the average consumer. However, they do plan to branch out into the market of lower-income consumers as well as those who exercise on a more casual basis. They’ve started by creating their app-only subscription which doesn’t require equipment and is cheaper at $12.99/mo (the all-access membership on equipment is $39/mo). They are also working on making cheaper versions of their equipment.

Peloton is not only aiming to target at-home fitness users, but also to get its equipment in the commercial sector. This is where the real money could potentially be made. While at-home fitness is a more accessible market for competitors, whoever becomes the dominant system in the commercial sector is more likely to become the dominant system in general. The online community and content are going to be crucial for every company in this sector going forward since it will make or break whether more people wish to join up and stay within that community.

*What would be the benefits of the commercial sector?*

If Peloton becomes the established name in gyms and hotels, users will be able to access their own personal account and stats from anywhere in the world. On holiday? No problem, you can still continue your workout. Already joined a gym? That’s cool. You can still create an account for free on the gym equipment with access to the Peloton classes for that equipment. Maybe it’ll get you hooked. Maybe you’ll get your own subscription so you can access the other classes. Commercial Pelotons also give you the option of buying your very own Peloton equipment while you use it, so if you’ve never tried Peloton and discover you like the experience you can conveniently buy home equipment for yourself while you’re on it.

So, we see here that Peloton has a lot of potential, hence people’s excitement. At-home fitness was starting to gain ground before the pandemic, but of course the pandemic really made it rocket. This is an exciting growth sector, but like any business it comes with risk. One of the biggest risks is competitors, so let’s look at them next.

&#x200B;

* **Competitors**

There are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:

Apple Fitness +

iFit/NordicTrack

FIIT

&#x200B;

**Apple**

First, let’s tackle the behemoth – Apple. Apple brought out its Fitness + app in December 2020. It caused a bit of a stir since, let’s face it, it’s Apple. They have a fantastic track record of being innovative with excellent marketing, and as a company they have plenty of money and clout to invest into their product. They also already have a market share of ready-made consumers in the form of Apple product owners. Anyone who has an ipad, iPhone or Apple TV can start using it for a cheaper $9.99/mo.

In my opinion, there’s no doubt that Apple is going to get a share of the market, but the question is how large will that market share be, and is it really a threat to Peloton?

Currently, Android controls the mobile OS market with a 71.93% share.

Apple has 28.07% of market share on phones

26.4% of market share on tablets

2% market share on TVs (Apple TV)

Even if Apple manages to convince all of its current users to subscribe to Fitness+ (which would be fantastic for Apple), it still leaves a massive share of the market open for non-Apple users.

Also, an Apple Watch is required if you want to be able to track your workout progress in a similar way to Peloton. Otherwise you have to input your information manually. An Apple Watch is cheaper than buying Peloton equipment of course, but it does provide another obstacle for those wishing to have the whole experience. For everyday fitness users or those on a budget, something like FIIT or iFit will probably be more attractive.

Another very important factor is that Peloton subscriptions can also be used with Apple devices including the watch, so people can just as easily sign up for that although the monthly cost is slightly more expensive.

Apple certainly has its advantages, and I think if they invested in integrated gym equipment they could be a real contender against Peloton, but as it stands, it appears they are focusing on a content-only style, and are aiming at the more casual fitness user who don’t need top-notch. Using an Apple Watch and ipad with some other adaptable gym equipment is not going to allow for certain metrics in the same way you’re going to get with a Peloton. As a result, Apple has a much more basic leaderboard, less of a social community, and more basic metrics. This is fine for the everyday casual user, but Peloton is going to be preferable for those who take their fitness seriously, or who have the income to drop some extra money into a more expensive, but higher quality experience.

According to Ben Williams, global CXO of the innovation consulting agency [r/GA](https://www.reddit.com/r/GA/), who has worked with brands including Nike, Equinox, and SoulCycle on designing connected fitness products and services. *“Peloton is a little more on the performance end of the spectrum, and Apple’s more of an everyday fitness kind of audience. There are certainly users in the middle, especially among Peloton subscribers who don’t own the hardware; if Apple and Peloton butt heads, it’ll be over that group.""* ([https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes](https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes))

**FIIT**

FIIT is a UK-based app that is now available in 175 countries including the US. It does classes with and without equipment, as well as barre classes. It's £20/mo, although it's £10/mo if you get a yearly subscription. I couldn’t find the US pricing, but as of writing, £20 should be equivalent to approx. $28 and £10 approx. $14, so prices should be somewhere around there.

Fiit has lower barrier to entry since you can use it with any equipment, it comes with a heart rate chest strap, and it also syncs with Apple Watch and Fitbits. Like PTON it has a leaderboard and personal board to try and beat your own rankings. However, it is less detailed than PTON's leaderboard. Fiit also offers both live and recorded classes.

One downside for Fiit is it only plays on phones, so in order to watch Fiit classes on a TV, tablet, laptop, etc. you must manually connect it to your phone. This wouldn't be a big obstacle for people who are focused on budget over convenience, but might be for other parts of the market (e.g. those not technologically-minded or those who just want an easy setup). You can use it on the TV without a manual connection to your phone if you have SkyQ.

FIIT has some potential in the content-only sector, but it doesn’t appear to be competing in the equipment sector, so, like Apple, it is a competitor for the mid- to lower-income/casual fitness user market.

**iFit/NordicTrack**

Currently, this is the competitor I see as a bigger threat to Peloton. Unlike Apple and FIIT, iFit does pair with NordicTrack gym equipment. NordicTrack is a bit cheaper than Peloton bikes, and they come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).

While NordicTrack is currently focusing on at-home equipment and not commercial equipment, it could draw some of the less-tapped mid-range market (e.g. fitness buffs on a budget and more casual fitness users with a mid-range income). Then there’s the threat that it moves into the commercial market later.

Some other pluses for iFit are –

It uses terrain mapping data drawn from Google Maps API to emulate i

1. Its terrain mapping system. *(""iFit uses terrain mapping data drawn from the Google Maps API to emulate the inclines and declines of the map you've drawn, and it also pulls scenery from Google Street View so you can see where you're biking. Maybe you don't need to go outside during quarantine after all. "")*

2. It has a faster repair service than Peloton at this time. Customers of iFit report that repairs take a week with Nordictrack vs weeks with Peloton.

You can read about Peloton vs. iFit here ([https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack)).

iFit/NordicTrack are trailing behind Peloton at the moment with regards to brand awareness and spreading its product. Whether or not it can catch up is going to depend on its marketing skills over the next few years. However, while it’s possible it could gain some market share for the commercial sector, it will have a tough time beating Peloton as market leader, and I believe it will not be doing so for the high-income sector since its focus is on appealing to the low to mid-income sector by making their product more affordable. Peloton has achieved a cult status, and much like designer goods, that can make it more desirable even (or especially) for lower incomes, whereas being initially seen as the more “affordable option” makes it harder to rank up.

So, while I expect NordicTrack to take some decent market share in future, I think there is more than enough of the fitness industry market to go around, and it will not hinder Peloton’s growth in any significant way over the next couple of years.

&#x200B;

* **Financials**

Ok, so that’s competitors. Let’s look at financials.

Peloton doesn't have a long history yet, and the pandemic obviously gave them a boost, so financials will only take us so far here. So far, their financials have seen a significant increase though net income amount is quite small in comparison to revenue.

We saw a 104.4% increase in revenue from September 2019 - December 2019 before the pandemic had emerged on the world stage and been seen as an issue. The net income, however, did decrease by 5 million and operating income decreased by 11 million.

This appears to be due to an increased amount of investment in R&D. By Q1 (March 2020), operating/net income increased slightly despite R&D expenses also increasing, which is a good sign imo. In Q2 (June 2020), the company was well into the green and R&D expenses dropped significantly, increasing again in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. This on top of increased S&G expenses seems to have reduced their general operating profit although it is still firmly in the green (59 million operating income as of Dec. 2020).

I've taken the year from Dec. 2019 - Dec. 2020 as measurement of the company's financial health since from Dec. 2019 shows a small slice of its progress pre-pandemic after the initial furore of going public.

· Revenue increased 99.55% (-446m to 1065m).

· Net income increased 216.4% (-55m to 64m).

· Operating income increased 195.2% (-62m to 59m)

· Operating expenses increased 41.3% (259m to 366m)

· R&D Expenses increases 128.6% (21m to 48m)

As we can see, operating expenses have increased much less in relation to the revenue/income. R&D expenses, while having a high percentage increase, are acceptable to me since it is a growing company, it is not putting it in the red financially, and it's a reinvestment into the company's growth.

Debt has slowly but steadily increased per quarter also. Net debt is currently at -619 mil. If PTON were to continue at a growth of debt of 59mil per quarter (as was reported last quarter) it would take 10 years to pay off. However, taking into account that it is currently in growth phase I'd expect PTON to increase their net income within 2 years (thanks to their subscription service), hopefully putting it at a steadier pay-off phase.

Retained earnings showed a dip in Dec. 2019 and Mar. 2020 after IPO, but is steadily increasing (albeit still heavily in the red). As of Dec. 2020 retained earnings are -561 mil. This does hold risk, but I'm personally positive on their growth and am giving allowance for their reinvestment and growth at this early point.

It's not good for shareholders at this point though as there is a lot of uncertainty over whether Peloton can maintain the level of growth that they had during the pandemic. I am of the opinion, that while they might not maintain the same level of growth, they are still going to grow considerably, especially over 2021 when many of us are still locked into the pandemic. Also, looking at their financials, they were heading in the right direction pre-pandemic. The fact that they were given a boost in 2020 is a bonus. If they can continue to maintain their ratio of income to operating expenses, which they have been doing so far, then they’re in a strong financial position imo.

Added to that, they have spread into Australia and have plans to spread into Asia, so providing this goes successfully, their income overall should only increase.

* **Fundamentals**

You can check out the fundamentals in this article - [https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/](https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/)

I haven’t studied fundamental analysis yet, so I’m relying on the experts for this information. As far as I can tell it seems pretty positive.

&#x200B;

* **Management**

First here’s some background on the leaders.

The founder John Foley is a health nut who came up with the concept. He’s described as a jack-of-all-trades having worked software, hardware, e-commerce, content production, marketing and gyms. He went to Harvard Business School, and is the founder of pronto.com and proust.com which, by the looks of it, didn’t succeed. He was also the president of eCommerce at Barnes & Noble. As founder of Peloton, he says he emphasises a focus on approachability – not having the hierarchical approach where the big bosses are lording it over the rest of the employees.

The current Peloton president was ex-CEO of Barnes & Noble which oversaw the launch of Nook. He resigned due to poor sales, though both he and Foley state that it couldn't win anyway since they were too late to the game behind Amazon. He was also a co-founder of gifts.com, and was Executive Vice President of Marketing and General Manager of [HSN.com](http://hsn.com/) He also served as VP for HSN, running the growing HSN.com e-commerce site. From 2000-2004, Lynch was vice president and general manager of e-commerce, for Palm Inc., where he oversaw Palm's Web properties. His earlier career included brand management positions at Seagram Universal and Guinness.

Peloton has generally high reviews (4-4.5 stars on websites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Peloton-Interactive-Reviews-E734449.htm) and [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Peloton/reviews)). It’s reported to have excellent employee benefits such as a no-vacation policy (people can take time off whenever they like for as long as they choose), 401k, medical and dental, college loan down payments, as well as child care and mental health telemedicine services. Another positive point to note is that on Glassdoor, one of the approval points (most voted for) is that people approve of the CEO.

I checked out the negative reviews, and a lot of them complain about a clique-y culture amongst staff, as well as disorganized or unfriendly management (often playing favourites). Most of these complaints seem to be in the lower-tier jobs of assembly/retail.

&#x200B;

* **Price Target/Conclusion**

Although I think Peloton will be volatile as lockdowns end and potentially go down for the short-term, I believe Peloton will do well long-term.

The difficulty right now is in how disconnected the share price is from the actual value, and deciding if it will, as the bears say, crash down to reality (aka a price that more accurately reflects its financials). In this area, it’s mainly speculation as far as I can tell, since growth stocks are held up by belief in the future of the company. This means a lot of the tangible growth may already be price in.

PTON’s LTM PE ratio is currently 190.9 x at time of writing which is ridiculously high, but with the expected growth in revenue is forecast to make it a PE ratio of 4.3 x in the next 12 months.

While I’m very leery of the fact that the stock is so disconnected from its underlying value at this point, the P/CF ratio and future forecasts put me more at ease. I think it’s still a riskier stock so I don’t plan to invest heavily, but I’m of the belief it will adjust long-term.

Analysts are expecting PTON to double its revenue over 2021, which, providing they maintain their same consistency in expenses, would put them at approx. $1.2 billion in net income. Compare this to 2019 when it was at $-53 million.

It’s difficult to compare this stock to others since it’s a leader in a new market niche. However, if we compare it to Netflix (a similar leader and disruptor) which has a net income of $2.76 billion and a current share price of approx. $530 per share, half that would have PTON around the $200 - $260 mark. Another point of note for me is that PTON accurately forecast there would be 4 million members out there in 2017, which it has now gained. Now the company is forecasting 100 million PTON members out of the 200 million gym goers. This would be a massive gain although, of course, it would take several years. [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/peloton-commercial-at-ces/)

At the moment, Netflix has 203.67 million subscribers. If Peloton could eventually get even half of the amount it is forecasting, it would put its share price in excellent standing.

As a pessimist, I don't think it will reach $200+ in 2021 with a $1.2 billion income since PTON is a different business model, has a different product, and other financials vary. Also, due to fears about the ending pandemic, overhype and competitors, it may progress more slowly and volatilely.

I’m conservative about Peloton’s optimism of gaining half the market, but I’m overall bullish for their future. I’m of the opinion that, while Peloton may drop in the short-term due to FUD, I think it will do well if held over 2021 so I see these next few weeks and months as a buying opportunity. I have a price target of between $200-$300 within the next 2-3 years. If it goes higher, great. Analysts seem to support the bullish view – many of them putting price targets of $130 - $200 (I think that’s the max) for 2021.

I consider Peloton a buy now, although personally I’d like it to go a bit lower before buying more since I think short-term FUD has the chance of bringing it down a bit further, and also because I’m a newbie at this and it’s a volatile stock. If it goes sub-100 at any point, I consider it a moderate to strong buy, and if it goes sub-90 I consider it a very strong buy. I myself, will not be putting a large amount into it, but I may add a few more shares to my position gradually as it falls (if it continues to fall). All this uncertainty over the pandemic ending seems like an excellent entry point for PTON.

**\[Note:** *While I was writing this DD, news also broke about a child dying due to one of the treadmills. Of course, this is a terrible thing to have happened to the family, and I feel bad to have to talk about it in terms of what it may do to the stock, but sadly that’s part and parcel of DD.*

*There are not details at time of writing as to how this child died. It is listed in Peloton equipment instructions for children and pets not to be near the equipment, and there is even a safety key that is to be removed when not using the equipment. I personally do not blame Peloton for it. Sadly, treadmill deaths, while rare (3 deaths per year on average), have happened with other companies in the past, but there’s no denying it’s a terrible loss for the family and that Peloton will also likely pay for it in terms of bad PR and a possible lawsuit. They may also need to begin work on making their products more child-friendly although I’m unsure if that will be required since they’re stated as only being for users 16+.*

*Stock has already fallen upon the news, and I won’t be surprised if it drops more between this incident and the general FUD. In my opinion, the next few weeks/months may be quite negative for PTON until they are able to restore trust with consistent earnings, but I still hold to them being a good long-term investment*.**\]**

Anyway, I hope this DD helped someone, and if you have any constructive criticism or advice I’d love to hear it. This was a slog for me since I’m learning as I go, but I enjoyed it. I’ll be practicing DD on other stocks in future so that I can “git gud”. I plan to study renewable energy next, so that may be my next post (providing this post doesn’t get downvoted to hell lol).

**TL;DR:** PTON stock go up, but maybe fall for short-term (Weeks? Months?) Current FUD = Good entry point. PTON be higher end of 2021. PT around $160 EOY, PT $200-300 in 2022-2023.","['NFLX', 'BEN', 'MAR', 'TGT', 'MO', 'CF', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'NKE', 'GOOGL']"
m8g5f8,grh9275,stocks,comment,1616161377,"Solid DD and I'll add a couple of things.  I'm a convert myself - 9 months ago I thought PTON was just another BYND, but I've come around to really believing in the bull thesis.

1) The valuation actually isn't that bad.  The company is still in the growth phase so using earnings multiples is unfair.  On an EV/sales metric, we're looking at trailing EV/sales of 18 and forward EV/sales of only 9.  While they aren't direct competitors, just for reference you can compare those numbers to other growth stocks like ROKU (25/17 respectively) or ETSY (16/12) or DKNG (40/26) etc.

2) The one thing missing from your DD, and the major differentiator between PTON and any other competitor, is the brand value.  I'm not a PTON customer myself, but every person I've spoke to is absolutely in love with it.  Peloton has a cult following, not because of the hardware, but because of the content.  Their instructors are fitness celebrities and people love being part of the community.  Competitors can easily recreate the hardware but copying the content and cult factor is much, much more difficult.  In this regard Peloton is like Tesla, Lululemon, or Apple (at least in the earlier days).","['ETSY', 'TSLA', 'AAPL']"

m8g5f8,grh3ryh,stocks,comment,1616158427,"Super job for your first DD! Well written and good understanding of key drivers. 

One idea is also to look into what analysts are saying about the stock (to see if maybe they have some additional thoughts to add to your analysis) and it’s also good to have an idea of their price targets for context. 

Another is to actually make a DCF. E.g what kind of revenue growth, margins, etc do you need to reach your expected price targets?

Peers are of course the best to compare with, not sure if Netflix is the best example. They operate in different industries, have different margins, and are at different levels in the business cycle. But I understand it may be difficult in some cases.

Good luck!",['NFLX']

m8zo7i,,stocks,post,1616215214,"Could AMZN be in 2050 what KO is to investors todayWhat I mean by this is that companies like KO are seen as slow-growth, value companies with wide market share over a core product / service and a decent moat.

Everyone will get a bottled beverage from time to time and it will likely come from KO. It's difficult to penetrate the beverage market because you need marketing, a brand, and an efficient supply chain. Buffett realized this with KO and it worked well for him.

However, KO is not going to be seeing monster growth, compared to something like a small cap, because everyone is already chugging beverages anyway.

Could AMZN become KO? In the sense that building out warehousing, a large-capacity E-commerce marketplace, and efficient shipping logistics (1 and 2 day) are large moats unlikely to be beaten by newcomers? Might not see monster growth because everyone around me is already saying ""check on Amazon,"" but it seems good own for slow-steady growth.

m8l7nj,,stocks,post,1616171773,"DD on UUUU or 'Energy Fuels'Don't know if this falls under rule 7, my apologies if it does.

Before I go on, everything you'll want to know is in this webcast from yesterday (second post titled 'Energy Fuels Strives to Return REE Production to the United States as Demand Grows): [https://news.networknewsaudio.com/](https://news.networknewsaudio.com/)

I'll keep it short:

Catalysts:

\- the US wants to remove its dependence on China for rare earths. it wants a supply chain that does not require China for processing, separation, etc. of rare earth metals

\- climate change has made the environmental left take a second look at uranium, and people on the left are now supporting nuclear energy as the most powerful carbon-free source of energy

\- energy needs are set to grow rapidly over the next two decades just as many uranium mines are shutting down, resulting in an impending supply crunch.

\- due to renewed interest in uranium, U companies have restarted purchasing in the spot market, which led to the largest single-day rise in some time just a few days ago: [https://numerco.com/NSet/](https://numerco.com/NSet/)

UUUU:

1. First, as a comparable, MP Materials is the biggest rare earths miner in the US/North America. They had great earnings yesterday, have a share price in the \~$43 range, and a market cap of about $5-6B. They mine bastnaesite and still ship their rare earths to China for processing.
2. UUUU, a year ago, embarked on a program to process rare earths of its own. They are not a rare earths miner. They contractually purchase (2500 tons as of right now) monazite ore from Chemours, from Chemours' mine in Georgia. They separate uranium from the monazite ore, then send it to Neo Performance Materials in Estonia, Europe, for the final stage of processing.
3. Monazite ore is richer in rare earths.

||Monazite|Bastnaesite|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Neodymium Praseodymium (NdPr)|22.6%|16.3%|
|Samarium Europium Gadolinium (SEG)|14.4%|1.1%|

4. UUUU's rare earths value chain is completely non-China, where MP's still goes through China.

5. As of now, MP produces significant quantities of rare earths, while UUUU is at the beginning.

6. MP cannot mine the richer monazite, as it contains radioactive uranium.

7. Price action: after significant run-ups recently, UUUU has taken a breather. It's dipped low.

8. UUUU is currently an $800-900m market cap with share price in the $6-7 range.

Conclusion: UUUU's current share price is massively undervalued. While MP currently produces significant rare earths, UUUU's impending production (up to 15,000 tons per year, equal to 50% of US rare earth demand) will be both higher quality and non-China. Putting together the superior REE play, plus its participation in the broader Uranium bull cycle, in my view, the price has significant upside.

The idea behind sitting on money is that statistically most people who do this end up losing out on gains and they'd be better off with all their money in equity.  This would mean youre better off holding almost/no cash.

Aren't these are pretty contradictory philosophies?",

m8padu,gripslt,stocks,comment,1616185215,"I literally just posted the info below on another thread but it is relevant here. I made a big mistake keeping a lot of cash out before covid crash happened but never actually putting it back into the market at the bottom. I kept waiting for the next ""covid variant"" to kill the momentum, etc. When January rolled around I realized I just flat out missed out and here I am. I am hesitant as ever to just stick the entire sum into the market right now so I committed to the idea of DCA. At some point it will pay off. 

I am trying to put a good chunk of money into the market and I have been picking anything with a ""fair value"" and buying 20 to 30 percent of my position depending on my confidence level. For instance, if I want in on AMD but it is an overheated sector then I am a bit bearish in price over the next few months. Of course I could be wrong. Let's say I want to have 3 percent of my portfolio (let's just say that would be $1000 for example) in this position but for starters I am going with 20 percent.... $200. I buy 3 shares @ $80/ea for $240.

I will then wait for a pullback of over 5 percent below my last purchase price. Higher depending on how volatile the stock is. Let's say I purchase an additional 5 shares every time it drops 8% below my last purchase price for AMD. This is a really conservative example and could be done with a number of different ratios. I just don't want to get burned in a sell off everyone keeps talking about so I am treading lightly on my positions. It also can drop 5 percent in a single day without much trouble recently. My ""bottom"" for this would be back to pre-covid levels which would be a really severe sell off and almost completely unlikely.

3 shares @ $80 - $240  
3 shares @ $73.60 - $220.8  
3 shares @ $67.71 - $203.13  
3 shares @ $62.29 - $186.87  
3 shares @ $57.31 - $171.93

Total position - $1,022.73

Cost basis - 15 shares @ $68.18/ea

Obviously this is a bit rough when the price is only $57 and you have a $68 cost basis but this would be worst case scenario. You also didn't over leverage yourself into a single position and were able to ride the price down roughly 30 percent over possibly a couple of months. On the flip side if the price goes up... and up... and up.... you only have $200 in and wanted $1000. I personally say ""oh well"" and wait for a serious pull back in the future but I won't chase the price up. I will be content with my small position and put money into a different company.

I am a bit more bearish about the rest of 2021 so this is my strategy getting into new positions. I will go with 30+ percent on my opening position if I really believe in the company regardless of share price. Hopefully I am wrong and I have a bunch of small positions doing really well!

This was never practical when there were $6 fees for every transaction!","['EA', 'AMD']"

m8padu,grj9mqw,stocks,comment,1616195265,Dca is good not because it beats lump sum but because it helps people deal with the emotions of lump summing and instantly seeing it drop after.

m8padu,grilu8d,stocks,comment,1616183427,Not necessarily.  You are thinking of lump sum investing as having all of your money in now but also it can mean leaving it on the sidelines trying to time when to put it in.  DCA can also mean just putting a little in each month as it become available rather than waiting until you have enough to buy your whole position at once.  However I agree that the idea of buying only a part of your position now and then DCA vs putting it all in now if you can afford to would be in conflict and I would go for the lump sum now in that case.,

If the recovery never comes, well, you've got other things to worry about. 

If you don't have stable income (like retirement or venerable to losing your job in a recession) then withdrawal during a bear will ruin your investments. (Buying low good, selling low bad).

If you're DCA because the capital isn't available until later (e.g. future pay-checks) then that isn't really a *choice* anyway. It is only a choice when you are intentionally sitting on cash you aren't investing to DCA it slowly.  

DCA makes people feel better, that is its core reason for being and the only purpose. If you're looking for mathematical efficiency, lump sum into a low fee highly diversified index fund is the solution. If you need to, simply stop checking it for a few years.",

&#x200B;

Since the sheet is impossible to get into these days with so much traffic (unless you're the lucky 50 - 60 that seem to get in) I thought I'd send screen shots of the pertinent info. If this seems like something everyone is interested in I'll keep it up. 

&#x200B;

Positions: [Here are the stocks I bought yesterday using this method.](https://imgur.com/gallery/oWLoqnj) If I had bought at the end of the day rather than getting impatient and buying around noon I'd be up a LOT more than this

&#x200B;

Today's data isn't really changing anything:

1. Reddit is still the best category
2. The score grouping of 500 is the most successful, with 250 being the next
3. Holding past the average **% to Max** date starts losing money, so sell quickly
4. The average number of days from the day it pops up on the list to max profit is 6 days (the 500 category is showing a REF error but I looked at the data and it's about 6 days)
5. The average % return you should expect is 15.81% - 17.70%. Because that's an average I usually start considering selling once it hits 10%

&#x200B;

Using the above criteria I did what I always do: 

1. Filter it down to those items, highlight the ones in the 500 category, then start searching Reddit for every ticker. 
2. I filter all posts by New so that I can see what the most recent conversation is.
3. I filter out any obvious bots or 1 person spamming multiple subs
4. I make a note of any ticker that is being discussed in at least 4 different subs. Extra points if there is a decent amount of conversation
5. From there I narrow it down to about 3 - 5 stocks that just *feel* good to me then spread my money out on all of them
6. Then I sit and wait until 10% - 15% or 6 days, whichever comes first

I'm partly NVDA drops a bit again so I can buy more a lower my cost basis. Has anybody bought here at what was a nice loss and then a year later you made back your investment and were back up?

m8qnu7,grj32i9,stocks,comment,1616191800,"I had a fairly big paper loss in QCOM for three years and ended up in a good spot, but I had a good reason to hold and buy more.  

Seriously,  I haven't paid much attention to NVDA, but why in the world do you expect it to go higher? It trippled in a bit over six months,  it has a PE of 75!  It's dividend is miniscule.

QCOM was paying me 5%.  They had governments questioning their licensing of their IP, AAPL took them to court and hadn't paid them for two years.   My thought was that even if they lost, it would be a pain to renegotiate all their deals, but they still owned the IP, they still had 5G tech coming,  and did I mention that they were paying me 5%?  I bought more as it fell and trippled my investment.   

That's not where you are with NVDA.  Other than a general feeling that you like the stock,  or it makes good products,  or it's been going up a lot in a raging bull market with all the momentum people piling in,  do you have a reason that it is going to go up?  Do you expect their earnings to triple next year?  Does a giant company owe them two billion dollars that hasn't been paid,  but will with intrest?  Do they have a new product line that isn't going to cannibalize what their selling now?  

Think hard, I haven't looked,  but unless there is a reason for it to go higher it's just as likely to be back down to where it was in June.","['QCOM', 'IP', 'NVDA', 'AAPL']"

m8ghu0,,stocks,post,1616158090,"SEC Pattern Day Trading Rules (Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts)SEC PATTERN DAY TRADER RULES

Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts

Cash accounts have unlimited day trading, but cannot trade with ""unsettled funds"", which require ""T+2"" (trade day, plus two more days) to become useable again. Brokerages will always use your settled funds first. You will be flagged for a ""good faith violation"" if you buy and sell a stock on the same day, but only if that stock was purchased with unsettled funds (proceeds gained from selling another stock that same day that did not sit for two days after purchasing it). If the stock is more than three days old, then when you sell it, the funds are settled immediately, and ready to use right away.

So to be clear : with a cash account, you can always buy and sell the stock same day, no matter what, but at a slight penalty to your operational liquidity. Account restrictions will be imposed for 90 days on the second good faith violation occurence using unsettled funds (no time limit). On the third violation, you are permanently branded with the PDT (Pattern Day Trader) label. They will not physically stop you from buying with unsettled funds until these restrictions are already triggered. It is up to you to keep up with it. Many times, you will not be notified in a timely manor, and will discover your account locked at the worst possible time.

The margin system was actually created as an end around loophole to the T+2 system (used to be T+3). It was created as instant micro loans to allow people to use their stocks as collateral while settling. But times have changed. In this age of instant everything, where buy and sell orders are not hand written, mailed, or over wire service, it really is preposterous that we do not have instant settled funds, just like we would at our bank, online, or at a casino/dog track.

Solutions :

Use two or three brokerages to spread out your day trades, thus avoiding the ""three strikes in one week"" PDT label and limitations at any one brokerage.

...or...

Only use one third of your money on any given day, on a rotating basis, at one brokerage, same result.

...or...

Get your account balance over $25,000 by any means necessary, then the PDT label will be meaningless, and will become your badge of honor.",

You are walking up a steep hill and move at a pace of 10 steps up, 3 steps back. you have a friend that stays 5 steps behind you at all times as you go up to make sure you don’t fall, but as you go down 3 steps your friend doesn’t move until you get back to that 5 step distance. So you are continuing to walk at that pace until you slip on a rock and now you fall 5 steps back and your friend is there to catch you. That is how a trailing stop works.
So basically, as you go up the stop moves, but as you go down the stop stays still in case things get bad.",
m8m7e8,griqyvf,stocks,comment,1616185766,"A trailing stop essentially has a ""following"" threshold that follows the price of the stock below(sell)/above(buy) by the set amount(% or $)... but the threshold will not go down(sell)/up(buy).

So say your sell trailing stop is 5$ and the stock is 100.

This means that it will sell if the stock drops below 95$. If the stock goes to 110$ then it will sell if the stock drops 110$-5$ = 105$. If it goes to 200$ then it will sell at 195$. 

So basically you will loose 5$ whatever the stock does because if it was 200$ you could have sold it at 200$ but it got sold automatically at 195$. 

This is good if you want to ""lock in"" your gains. You won't get the maximum theoretical gains but you can at least lock them in. 

Buy work exactly the same except everything is mirrored.  If you put in a buy trailing stop of 5$ then the threshold is always 5$ above the stock price and if it goes up past the threshold you'll buy before it gets any higher.

Think of the trailing stop as a sort of ""automated"" of what you do. As you monitor the price you will say if it goes down below 5$(or whatever) I'll sell it but as the stock guys up in price you keep saying this. 

&#x200B;

The math is basically, for a sell, ""if Last Maximum Price - Threshold Price > Price then sell""

The idea is very simple, you want to sell when the stock reaches it's maximum price(that maximizes your returns). The problem is that a stock fluctuates quite a bit so you can't just set the limit to what you think the max is because it will almost surely sell off immediately(that would be a limit order). So you allow some ""cushion"" for the stock to vary. If you set the threshold to low, say 1% and the stock is jumping 2% around as it goes up then you'll sell the stock before you can recognize the gains. The downside is that you limit your profits because you lose the threshold. E.g., if you set a 1% threshold then you will lose 1% of the max profits. (this isn't a huge deal because you can never predict the max)

&#x200B;

The real problem is that in volatility  you can lose a lot more than than it looks. I set a trailing stop at 380$ for 360$ for GME and people sold off and I ended up with 317$. I didn't get the 360$. The reason is the shorters sold off so much so quick that the price dropped too fast to trigger the sell in time. By the time the brokerage got to my order the price dropped from 380$ to 317$. That is a significant loss of profit. This is why HF's pay to get their orders taken care of first so they don't have these problems. It's also why they do these short attacks so they can make people lose money this way.",

What most people don't understand is how to actually analyze the economy and how you can't really just sum it up in one or two key metrics and call it good or bad. It is a myriad of things. 

we can use the pandemic as an example:

Looking naively at the unemployment charts, last spring we spiked with shutdowns all the way to a crazy 14+%. then immediately started trending downward to now  about 6.9%. obviously not great but huge improvement. This figures point to a bad economy...

but then go take a look at tax revenues for 2020. they are up from 2019, actually up quite a bit, almost $300 billion nationwide. 2019 had 4% unemployment while the majority of 2020 ranged from basically 7% to 14%... how does that sync?

The WHO. only certain sectors absorbed the brunt of the unemployment, namely travel, some retail and food service. 

Aggregate numbers don't tell the story of how millions of good paying jobs kept on. they adapted and figure out how to work from home. It doesn't tell the story about how the pandemic opened new markets and exploded other sectors while some faltered.

Who is their customer and what is their product?

RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services?  Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.

Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.

Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?

Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?

Of course I haven’t written this piece, copied from SAXO BANK platform. 

I tried to post the 3 charts as well, but don’t know how, I am sure you can find them. 

I am not knowledgeable enough to understand as to how serious this is or not? Hope you understand this better than me. 




By maintaining monetary policies easy but letting long-term yields free to move, the Federal Reserve gives support to lower quality credits while putting quality at risk. We are heading towards an unprecedented duration event that will weight on high duration assets, which in the bond market are concentrated within the investment-grade corporate space. The US investment grade (IG) corporate bond sector is heading to the worst quarter since 1981, with the utilities and communications sectors being more exposed to rising interest rates than others. The technology sector, which saw stellar valuations in the stock market last year, is characterized by a duration of eight and a half years, which matches the US IG average.
The market doesn't care about the Federal Reserve's dovish state of mind. The Fed said it itself: the economic outlook is improving substantially with inflation destined to rise together with the country's GDP, while the labour market gets stronger. Nevertheless, the central bank decided to stand still and continue with its accommodative monetary policy. This decision leaves the market with the
ONLY OPTION TO TAKE THE SITUATION INTO ITS OWN HANDS AND DUMPING TREASURIES
that will inevitably lose value.

The steeping of the US yield curve resumed this morning with the curve's belly and the benchmark 10-year yields rising faster than long-term US Treasuries. The big issue is that if economic forecasts and inflation expectations continue to rise, r
ATES WILL NOT STABILIZE UNTIL THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECIDES TO INTERVENE AND ENGAGE IN THE INFAMOUS YIELD CURVE CONTROL (YCC)
. In our view, YCC will be unavoidable because, although the market can function with higher rates now, the higher they go, the more the pain that will be inflicted on those assets with historically high durations.

The market is talking about 10-year yields hitting 2%; however, if the Federal Reserve continues to keep watching, they might rise much further. The Fed has been able to maintain easy financial conditions by keeping real rates negative. However, they will not stay negative forever. In normal circumstances, nominal yields should price over the breakeven rate. It means that if inflation expectations continue to rise, we inevitably will see 10-year yields rising above 2.3%.

A BROAD CROSS-ASSET SELLOFF MIGHT SPARK FROM HIGH-GRADE CREDITS  RATHER THAN JUNK

Yesterday’s FOMC meeting and today’s selloff in sovereigns reinforce our belief that
WE ARE WITNESSING A HISTORICAL DURATION EVENT
.
The investment-grade corporate bond market will fall faster than junk within this context because of its sensibility to higher duration. Indeed, while the average duration within junk is around three and a half years, the investment-grade bond space carries a duration of more than 8 years. Duration within quality credits has recently increased dramatically: in the past two years, duration has increased by one year and a half. To put things into context: it took four years after the global financial crisis for the duration to increase by as much.

18_03_AS2
If we put Treasuries into the equation, we would see that in 2013 amid the Taper Tantrum, 10-year yields rose by 130 basis points; however, investment-grade corporate bonds fell only by 2%. This year Investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen already by 3.36%, the most in forty years, with 10-year yields rising only by nearly 85bps showing that
DURATION IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN CREDIT QUALITY
. Indeed, by
MAINTAINING MONETARY POLICIES EASY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE GIVES SUPPORT TO LOWER QUALITY CREDITS ON ONE HAND. ON THE OTHER, BY LETTING LONG-TERM YIELDS MOVE FREELY WHILE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING, THE CENTRAL BANK PUTS QUALITY AT RISK.
And who sits on quality? Everybody, more in particular real money with long-term strategies such as insurances and pension funds. And again, it is deja-vu: we might be headed towards another Global Financial Crisis?

18_03_AS3
As the yield curve continues to steepen will be essential to limit interest rate sensitivity. It will be interesting to know that the sectors that carry the highest duration are the communication and utility sectors whose duration is well above 10 years. The technology sector is within the US IG average, with around eight years and a half in duration. For those looking for quality while reducing duration sensibly, high-grade financials provide 6 years duration, almost half than that offered by the communications and utility sectors.",
m8o13x,grij8q9,stocks,comment,1616182215,"All of this is routed in the bullshit that the economy you see today is the same one you saw in January 2020, when you could walk into a theatre and eat at a restaurant. 
Also at play is Republican propaganda that these stimulus packages will ruin the economy... because only Republicans are allowed to give stimulus.

The reality is that the economy can still fall off a cliff, there’s a real 3rd wave and a few virus strains that are not responding to vaccines, which means that this mess isn’t over.
There is still at least 7million people unemployed from 2019 high. 
There is rent and mortgage assistance, there are eviction moratoriums, and this is occurring the world around.

These assholes are literally looking at a Government supported economy and saying that things look great, so let’s make more money, while completely ignoring the massive amount of social assistance going on in the US and around the world (we’ll call these customers of the US).

So it’s literally punch a banker in the face month.  If you see some idiot going on about inflation, then punch them in the face.

Powell isn’t talking code. The economy stinks, it’ll take SOME TIME to get back to how things were.

All of these store price inflationary events are linked to cargo management problems due to poor management decisions at the onset of the pandemic. They laid off 30% of their workforce and then tried to automate some systems, and this backfired at the ports when demand went through the roof. They fell behind.  It’s the same level of stupidity as car company management, where they cancelled CPU contracts with a 2-year lead time, to save a few bucks, and then they were suddenly swamped by demand due to the move from cities to rural homes. They didn’t sell it like they made a stupid mistake though did they, they pissed and whined and framed it like a CPU shortage and made it political. 

Major economic reorganizations are always coupled with a recession. You simply can’t have everyone move into the suburbs at the same time without causing a loss of income in some sector of the economy (like downtown services). We’re also looking at huge deflationary events that are getting stronger.  Please point to a job that cannot be replaced by a computer or a robot, there are few remaining.",

Are you suggesting that it is stupid to sell on bad news because if nobody sold the price would stay the same? Although technically true, good luck coordinating with the entire market. If people think the price is going to drop, there are always going to be sellers. 

&#x200B;

> Also what makes it really stupid is that when someone is selling because of bad news someone else is buying the same bad news! 

Why is this stupid? Of course a sale has to have a buyer, but prices don't drop from sales alone. You could just as easily reverse your comment and say that every buyer has to have a seller on the way up. So, by the same logic it would be stupid to sell on the way up. Ultimately, nobody knows which way it is going, so mistakes are only known in hindsight.

Prices don't fall from sales or purchases alone, they change when the pressure of one exceeds the other. If bad news comes out, nobody is going to want to buy at current prices, so naturally bids are going to fall. If anyone wants to sell, which they always will, the asking price will fall if there aren't enough buyers.

Similarly, the amount that a stock falls on bad news isn't just based on the willingness to sell, it is the willingness to buy. If people want to buy it at the current price, it won't fall. It falls because there are more people that want to sell than there are buyers at a current price.",

The price of ZKIN is in a strong short term uptrend as the price continues to find support and bounce from 20 EMA.

If we look for this trend to continue, the price can't fall below 20 EMA with a full candle body. So a drop below $12 will bring the price to $11.

The way I understand it is, I buy a stock and sell it for a loss and rebuy within 30 days triggering a wash sale and my cost basis gets adjusted as if I never sold the stock but I just can’t figure out anything further than that and how it affects traders like me",

m8k98t,grhqnqe,stocks,comment,1616169643,"Generally the wash sales work themselves out.   It can get strange depending on if your shares are all together or if you’re selling and buying the shares at different price points depending on your share management.   Eventually if you sell all your positions and wait 61 days then the math should work out.   

For example if you’re using fifo management of shares, and you buy 100@$10 then average down by buying another 100@$5, your cost basis would be $7.50 per share for your holdings.   If the stock rises to $7.50 and you sell half, the first shares you bought would be sold in fifo management meaning you’d show a loss of $250 on the sale, but your remaining position would be comprised of shares with a cost basis of $5, showing a gain of $250 in your current holding.

If your shares are set to LIFO then you’d realize the gain of $250 and your remaining position would show a loss of $250 or a share cost basis of $10.

Obviously it gets more complex than this the more you trade various costs and lot sizes, but at the end of the day when you close your position and wait for 61 days it all balances out.  If you’re planning to hold long term then it can be advantageous for taxes to pick the shares you want to sell in a given year to either realize a gain or loss in the year.   Mostly I worry about that on long term positions around Halloween if there’s a reason to.",

m81rlu,,stocks,post,1616104517,"Where are those who were around for the 2008 ""crash"" and do you remember the recovery sentiment?I do not claim to be a bear or a bull in this market. I am just along for the ride but some of the feel I get from the media and the public remind me a lot of the 2008 crisis. Well more so the recovery from the crisis. I was probably the age of the average reddit user trading today when it happened. FYI it was much harder to get into trading (and expensive) back then... make sure to appreciate the time you are living in! 

What I remember was that when the fed stepped in and started handing out money everyone was dropping the word ""hyperinflation."" It was the first time I had heard of it and I had to figure out what it meant.

They also cut interest rates in half and the theme was ""it is only a matter of time before they came back."" I bought a house in 2011 and my loan officer was pushing me to hurry before interest rates went higher. 

They started this ""quantitative easing"" for the stock market where the government dumped money in so it would move up ""artificially."" This is how it was explained to me at the time and why people started talking about the bubble building that was going to ""pop"" in the stock market as it recovered to it's ""pre-crisis"" levels. 

When I think back to the ""sentiment"" of the financial crisis I see a lot of the same things today but it is all compressed into a much shorter time frame now. It also has this ""double down"" feel. Interest rates didn't ever recover and were cut in half yet again during the covid crisis. The fed is printing far more money then they did back then (though the bail outs were huge). I don't think they ever really stopped (someone else can clarify) injecting money into the economy. I also would like to note that inflation didn't ""get out of control"" but it sure seems things are much more expensive even though the numbers they follow don't show that. 

TL;DR These are the things that come to my mind from watching CNBC everyday after work during the financial crisis. The worries of then seem to be similar to the worries of today but they didn't actually play out back then. At the same time it seems we never got ""back to where we were"" when you consider the fed's involvement after 2009. They seem to be perpetually stuck injecting money and keeping rates low. Whenever they try to step away the market throws a tantrum and they come back. Can anyone else make some comparisons as to how this time is different or possibly the same? 

Bonus Question: Are any signs of a weak economy always going to be the responsibility of the fed to fix it? (More in reference to 2018-2019 than the covid crash.)",
m81rlu,greyak4,stocks,comment,1616105708,"I had just started investing right before the crash. 

At the bottom the market was down, I guess, like 60%. And people still thought it could go lower. I personally know people that sold in early 2009, just before the bottom and didn't get back in till several years later. Some never got back in at all.  

On the way up there was talk about v shaped recoveries and how it's not possible (which I've found to be a recurring theme). Basically the entire ride up, people were calling for corrections, having the big crash pretty fresh in their minds: 2010, 2013, 2015 - I remember this being a particularly strong sentiment in these years. 

As for myself. I did terribly. Jumping in and out of stocks on the way down. Then when we had a sharp recovery, I remember getting into short etfs. I didn't really find my footing till around 2011. 

It was a crazy time to be invested. I learned a lot of (thankfully cheap) lessons.",
m81rlu,greykfr,stocks,comment,1616105838,"Hm, I remember the talk about there basically being a «credit squeeze». Security through «junk» loans got called out as the rotten shit they were. Resulting in credit drying up or getting expensive. Essentially nobody wanted to loan out to another enterprise, general distrust. I remember interest rates on house loans skyrocketet. If you owner a business, you probably had a bad time financially. Laying staff off or saving where you could, postponing new investments.

Stocks plummeted. Ah, the bargaigns you could do at the time....

In come the central banks across the world. Promising to fix things to keep interest low, so that no companies that shouldn’t have to fail would fail, and nobody would lose their house due to crazy interest. Printing money and taking over junk bonds, bailing out those «too big to fail».

Stock recovered in like 2-3 years. 

And, somehow...they just continued to keep the rates low the next 12 years. Trying to ease back just as covid hit. Or so they said. Always seemed to be another excuse to keep the interest low.

m80afu,,stocks,post,1616100371,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks. Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

As of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control.

First of all, looking at the ATH for the 10yr is baffling. The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago. They have consistently gone down over time. Isn’t it kind of obvious this is only short term? 

Secondly, how exactly is the 10 year related to a huge increase in inflation? I don’t get this concept. 

The way all this seems to me is that the media and other influencers are leeching onto something to create a bearish case against a roaring market. 

Thanks for your guidance!",
m84fqx,grfnm0w,stocks,comment,1616118498,"So, there's a few things happening that are all kind of related in varying degrees.

>how exactly is the 10 year related to a huge increase in inflation? I don’t get this concept.

They are kind of related but not really.  They are more separate than linked.

Let's start with inflation.  Inflation generally occurs in large amounts when there is a prolonged period of high velocity money printing.

A relatively recent example of this is pre-WWII Germany.  In this period, the German government employed a large number of its citizens to print money.  The recounts of the paper mills and printing presses are staggering.  In those days, they had to physically print the bills.  So, they did this for months and months and months and months.  Ultimately, it caused rampant inflation and economic collapse.

So, there is fear from some US investors that the combination of the 3 stimulus packages, the US government's history of running a deficit, and the federal reserve's current monetary policy will cause inflation.

This is more or less the inflation argument.  I wouldn't panic or get super worried over it.  The US government has economic tools to create and to reduce inflation.  If it starts to get too high, they can reign it in.

Next, the US Treasury bond interest rates are set by the US Treasury.  At its core, it is that simple.  Any given week, the bankers get together and decide how many bonds they want to sell and at what rate.  Then, they go out and try to sell them.  The results of the sale determine what happens going into the next week when they try to sell more.  If no one bought last week's set of bonds, they likely need to raise the interest rates to make them more attractive to buyers for the following week.

Now, the logical follow-up question, ""Why are people not buying them?"", is a very hard question to answer and is beyond what I know and can explain on the internet.

&#x200B;

>The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago

This is correct.  The US government has been pushing interest rates down since about the 1980s to stimulate the economy.  This is worrisome to certain US investors but, again, is beyond my understanding and ability explain.

And finally, stock prices.

There is a math equation analysts use to predict the future value of stock prices.  So, think like: ""x + y + z + w = stock price in the future""

One of those variables is the interest rate.  When the interest rate goes up, the stock price the math equation produces gets smaller.  So, large institutions and investors start selling as the interest rate climbs.",
m84fqx,grfj9d5,stocks,comment,1616116213,"Investors aren’t buying 10 year tbills at current prices because they think their return will be eroded by inflation. The US government still auctions off new debt (increasing supply). If no one buys these bonds, but supply increases, the price of these bond decrease (causing yields to rise). 

This is bad for stocks in a few ways:

10 yr is used in a lot of valuation models as risk free rate. Higher discount rate means lower valuations. 

Rising yields also increase the cost of borrowing which means less available cash for growth initiatives. If the company can’t grow, neither can their stock price. 

Higher bond yields also make bonds more attractive leading to a rotation out of equities.. we haven’t really seen this yet, but I’d expect this if/when 10 yr hits around 3-3.5%. 

Rates are not high relative to historical norms but we’ve been in a suppressed environment for 10+ years. There is also SO MUCH debt right now, which is why small movement in rates has caused this much volatility.

We are in a very precarious situation. So far the FED has played its cards right, but one wrong move could blow up the bond market.",

m83v0p,,stocks,post,1616110387,"SKLZ - A Rising Esports Giant (DD)Hey all. I'll be focusing on the fundamentals of the company here. This post is my first DD, and as such I welcome you to comment, provide feedback, poke holes in my analysis, and so on with open arms. If this is detailed enough to inform anyone about the company, then even better. With that being said, I'm organizing this in accordance with my DD spreadsheet that I use.

What is SKLZ?

SKLZ, or Skillz, is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games. Players use this platform to participate in millions of mobile and online competitions across the world daily. Skillz doesn't directly create games, as it lets third-party developers create them and then capitalizes on the opportunity to host online tournaments on said games. The company was founded in 2012 and, as far as I can tell, currently has about 230 employees. Their market cap currently sits at $10.84 Billion.

CEO Notes

Andrew Paradise is both the CEO and original founder of Skillz. He has led the company to $400 million in revenue. This is also not the first company he has founded and grown. In 2012, Paradise founded Double Picture, an advertising technology company, which went on to develop partnerships with Apple and was eventually sold. Paradise also founded AisleBuyer, a company whose technology was eventually sold to Intuit and became Intuit GoPayment. Having a CEO with this much prior experience and success is a great sign to me.

Financials

Skillz released their last report in December of 2020, which is what I'm working off of. Revenue grew 92% to $230 million in 2020, compared with $120 million during 2019. Gross profit grew 91% to $218 million during 2020, compared with $114 million in 2019. Gross margin was 95% during 2020, the same as the year prior. Net loss was $122 million during 2020, compared with a net loss of $24 million during 2019. GMV grew 80% to $1.6 billion during 2020, compared with $886 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $263 million of cash and no debt.

Partnerships (if Applicable)

Skillz joined forces with the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) in 2019, which was a large vote of confidence. In February of 2021, Skillz also started a partnership with the NFL. As part of the multi-year agreement, the organizations will hold a global game developer challenge. Those that take part will need to create an NFL-themed mobile title, which will be powered via Skillz's esports platform. This is a huge opportunity for visibility, and to expand Skillz's player base.

Potential Catalysts

The NFL agreement was my main one here. I think this partnership is a great way to expand the company's player base.

Other Notes

Management at Skillz says their users average an hour a day on their games, which is more than TikTok or Snapchat. Gaming tournaments, much like gambling, are addictive, and Skillz seems to be very adept at capitalizing on this. The CEO also mentioned in the company's last earning report that the company gets 90% of revenue from North America, and hopes to expand into India later this year. R&D also grew over 40% over the prior quarter, as the company moves to expand into new game releases (CEO has mentioned fighting, racing, and FPS games as future additions to their library) and further researches how to boost engagement among its user base.

Smartphone gaming revenue was estimated at over 63 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2020, with revenue from tablet games reaching 13.7 billion U.S. dollars. Moreover, forecasts suggest that revenue from the mobile gaming industry will continue to grow, surpassing the 100 billion U.S. dollar mark by 2023. This company is already in a great position to continue to capitalize on this market, provided they continue to focus on growing their player base and available games.

The Bear Case

Skillz currently gets over 70% of its revenue from three games alone, underlining how critical it will be for Skills to develop new games over time. Its regular users also dropped from 2.7 million to 2.4 million over the course of the past year. While their paying users did double, maintaining their revenue anyway, it could be a cause for concern. The company spent over $250 million in advertising last year, and their user base still declined. These numbers aren't damning by any means, but they do raise some concern for me.

Overall Opinion

In general, I believe that this company has massive potential to be huge. The global gaming market was valued at USD $162.32 billion in 2020, with a large portion of that market being in mobile and tablet gaming. With a current stock price at $26.75, I honestly feel that this company has the potential to grow and dominate the mobile esports market, and may grow to upwards of $60 over the next couple of years - and I feel that is a conservative estimate.","['INTU', 'AAPL']"

(OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further","['CRM', 'TGT']"

Assets to reduce a Portfolio‘s market risk

I was going over my portfolio today and realised that I‘ve put quite some time and effort into trying to diversify it and reduce market risk. However I‘ve seen that my returns have a 0.85 correlation coefficient with the S&amp;P500, which I guess is nice when you have high returns, less so when the market crashes like in the Corona Crash of March 2020.

Now my question: 

*What assets do you guys use to „flatten“ your returns / reduce market risk? How much cash do you have on the sidelines?*

I don‘t really want to have any short exposure in my portfolio due to borrowing fees and the potentially infinite losses (I wouldn‘t want to be in a [stock that shall not be named]-like short position and seeing it go from 40 - 400 in a matter of days). I‘m rather looking for some commodity like assets whilst still maintaining relatively high returns, fixed income isn‘t really appealing to me either.

I personally was thinking of increasing my exposure to:

**1.) Uranium** via Yellowcake Plc - Nuclear power will be around for some time and afaik the Biden administration is making a push towards cleaner energy (I‘m not American so I‘m not really following that on the daily). Also from a geopolitical PoV the areas in which Uranium is mined have rather high geopolitical risks tied to them which in turn creates a scarcity in supply. This is a pretty nice [read](https://grayscale.co/financial-advisors-toolkit/) on that topic.

**2.) REITs** especially ones in APAC (for example CapitaLand - have a small position there) as there are countless studies showing the importance and relevance of the „Rising Asian Middle Class“ and they have relatively high returns and dividends considering the fact that it‘s Real Estate and not some growth stock. They‘re also partially invested in Europe (just closed a deal this week to buy 11 data centers in Europe).

Do you guys see any other geographical areas with relatively low risk and high growth potential (Any specific ETFs/REITs perhaps)? I feel like the USA and EU are kind of „done“ in terms of Real Estate growth.

**3.) Crypto currencies** via some Grayscale ETF (not sure which one yet - they‘re talking about releasing a very broad one which would include ADA and some other lesser known cryptos - might give that one a go or just go for the Grayscale Digital Large Cap one which includes BTC, ETH, LTC weighted by respective market caps) as I‘m under the impression that people these days are rather going into that space rather than Gold.

I hate to say it but I truly believe that it might replace gold as a store of value. Exhibit A: Huge market sell-off the past days and a few weeks ago - Gold price barely increased whilst cryptos such as BTC hit new all-time highs. I guess we‘ll have to adapt.

m97ggg,,investing,post,1616248307,"Cathie Wood: Inflation vs Deflationary forcesIn a recent video, Cathie goes back in time to the end of 2016 - Early 2017.

Quantitative easing was on its way out and the FED was going to start raising the interest rates.
The market was very nervous...

Trump won the election and the odds of a cyclical burst increased because of his promise to cut taxes and that's exactly what happened!

In the beginning the equity market was very nervous around the idea that interest rates would be going up.
When Trump was elected - value stock took off just like they're getting off now - responding to this idea that economy is developing ahead of steam so the value stocks have taken off.

If you look at year to date: energy stocks are up 27%, financial stocks 11%, tech stock 1% and health stocks are actually down.
So basically traditional value stocks are having a nice run!
So right now we are in a 2016 like scenario, value stocks are up and growth strategy stocks are down (Take ARK ETFs as a perfect example)

Cathie thinks this is great because the bull market is broadening out to other sectors and this - can only be a good thing for ""disruptive innovation"" stocks investors.

What would be negative instead?
It would be a negative thing if the bull market continues to narrow and only innovation strategy worked, because that's what happened with the .com tech bubble in 2000.
(And we all know how bad the consequences have been).

Cathie actually likes the fear that ARK is experiencing and that there's a reality check, in terms of the speculative moves that have taken place within the innovation space.

What happened post Q4 2016 after the market had broadened out?
Well… 2017 was a fantastic year for the equity market in general with cyclical value and growth. 
And she believes we're now moving towards a similar scenario.

Now let's find out what Cathie's said on Bitcoin being speculative, not sustainable, not environment friendly and heavily used for illicit activities.
With a lot of respect Cathie says that Janet Yellen doesn't understand the crypto space, simply because it's not her main focus.

Regarding the environmental issue: comparing the energy required for BTC mining to the energy required to mine gold you can clearly see that the first is a fraction of the latter. It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC. 
 
She also reports what an FBI agent told her.
According to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets.
BTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.

Talking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases.
So it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech.
Regarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction… it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin.
And the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.

Cathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation.
ARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other.
Good vs bad deflation.
Good deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.

* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.
* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly.
And according to ARK forecasts… EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.

Concluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:

* Robotics
* AI
* Blockchain
* DNA sequencing

And these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect.
Think about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.

On the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned.
The disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change.
Financial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around.
Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.

So we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.

m8o362,,investing,post,1616179606,"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )  

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

In a historic first for the Indian bond market, the central bank on Friday enabled quotes for negative yields on government securities in the negotiated dealing system – order matching (NDS-OM) to choke short sellers in the bond market, who have run amok in recent weeks.  


Bond dealers said the 6.17 per cent government bond maturing in 2021 was offered at a yield of minus 1.5 per cent, a first in the government securities market.

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

m9167z,,investing,post,1616221144,"Coinbase’s Direct Listing Pushed Back to AprilCoinbase Global Inc., the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is now aiming to go public in April after its plans for a direct listing this month have slipped, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it was private.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reviewing the company’s plans for a direct listing, an alternative to a traditional initial public offering.

A representative for Coinbase declined to comment.

This week, Coinbase’s backers registered for as many as 114.9 million shares to trade when the stock lists. In a direct listing, investors can begin selling their holdings as soon as a company starts trading rather than waiting for the expiration of a lockup period -- typically up to six months in an IPO.

Investment firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures are among those whose shares could trade, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam have also registered stock.

Coinbase shares have changed hands at $200 to $375.01 in private transactions this year, the filing shows. The volume-weighted average price per share for transactions from January through March 15 was $343.58, which would give Coinbase a public market valuation of about $67.6 billion, based on the total number of shares outstanding as of Monday. The fully diluted value -- including employee incentive plans and restricted stock units -- would be significantly higher.

The debut will be the first major direct listing to take place on the Nasdaq. All such previous listings were on the New York Stock Exchange, including those by Spotify Technology SA, Slack Technologies Inc., Asana Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Roblox Corp., which listed this month.

Coinbase’s latest financial statements revealed that the company is making money, setting it apart from many other startups when they make their public debuts. Coinbase swung from a loss to a profit of $322 million last year on net revenue that more than doubled to $1.14 billion.

m8ugyr,,investing,post,1616197509,"GAW (Warhammer) & Cineworld Group DD# ***Disclaimer, positions and reasoning for post.***

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know.

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance. This ruling may have a significant impact on funds and investments classified under ESG and socially responsible investing.""

There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge.

>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too. 

Otherwise I believe its a good buy in the short term",['AMZN']

The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

   Continuing claims, week ended March 6: 4.124 million vs. 4.034 million expected and 4.144 million during the prior week

Initial unemployment claims were expected to hold below 800,000 for a fourth consecutive week. Still, initial jobless claims remain above the Great Recession-era high of 665,000 from 2009. And new claims still need to fall significantly further to return to 2019 levels, when new claims averaged just over 200,000 per week.

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).

&amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows alnost all the various stamps website growing hugely in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)

&amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

[10-K report.](https://wallmine.com/doc/edgar/0001082923/000108292321000033/stmp-20201231.htm)

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat. 

Looking forward to seeing the stock price go to less than a $1.",['TWTR']
m7ih59,,investing,post,1616039606,"The Current State of Uranium. A Move In Spot Price Could Be SoonGenerally speaking, I am looking at uranium as a macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market. At a high level, uranium needs to be in the $50+ (some say $60+) range in order to cover the cost of production. Right now the spot price is hovering around $30.   

That being said, uranium is outperforming. So what then is driving this run? Are we likely to see a move in spot soon?

Personally, I think that the equities are ahead of themselves a little bit and that we could be seeing a pull back soon. I hope not. Still, the spot price is a little bit of a question mark for me because I have seen a number of interviews saying that we are very close for a move in the uranium price. This has led me to the view that I should hold my positions and slowly build until the spot price starts to move.  It’s a risk, but my hypothesis is that the real move will far outpace where we are today.  

Ultimately, uranium is about climate change more than anything and so I am glad we are ahead of schedule. Nuclear is the only way to achieve the carbon goals. 

I will be watching closely in the next few weeks for any movement in the uranium price. Should the spot rise as many of us expect, uranium stock prices will soar.

As always. I am interested in how others perceive the current landscape. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['AMZN', 'PYPL', 'EBAY', 'ETSY']"

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['AMZN', 'FB', 'EBAY']"

*Washington D.C., March 15, 2021 —*

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges and an asset freeze and other emergency relief against an Irvine, California-based trader who used social media to spread false information about a defunct company, while secretly profiting by selling his own holdings of the company's stock.",

m6yvdo,,investing,post,1615982617,"Fed Set To Reaffirm Dovish Stance With Powell Likely To Urge PatienceBolstered by the impact of fiscal and Covid-19 stimulus packages, the US Federal Reserve is expected to forecast an improving economic outlook with the labour market and inflation to rebound faster than anticipated in December.

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

m71yzd,,investing,post,1615992262,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['PWR', 'ED']"
m7c1ig,grbowud,investing,comment,1616046384,It may not be physical... but I know an ass whoopin when I see one. Great fucking points and $Tusk has my complete and undivided attention.,
m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.","['AMZN', 'WMT', 'TGT']"

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet.

2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['GPS', 'PGR']"

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.

m6zzhm,,investing,post,1615986444,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['MMM', 'TER', 'TXN', 'QCOM', 'IBM', 'NVDA', 'ARKK', 'BA', 'INTC']"

TL;DR: 

I think this is the new paradigm. 

For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars.

> I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars.

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

> I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets.

Is there a Vanguard index fund that encompasses his description of Asian/Chinese emerging markets?

m7c6gf,,investing,post,1616019296,"Apple (fruit) stock analogySo many people are talking about stocks this year, which is similar to the past times when stocks are shooting up and the majority of people are generally winning for now, and feeling good about it, and eager to talk about it, for all sorts of reasons.  

That includes everyone from novice investors to advanced and sophisticated investors, and everyone in between.

One of the most concerning things I hear is this.  

""You should by X.""

""Why?""

""Oh, it was 300 dollars yesterday.  It's 250 now.  So it's cheap.  It's going to go back up"".

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

Good luck out there, be careful, and have fun.",['AAPL']

Alibaba's internet browser has been removed from several app stores in China, according to a report from The Financial Times on Tuesday.

Android app stores including those operated by Huawei, Xiaomi and Tencent have reportedly blocked downloads or removed Alibaba's ""UC Browser."" CNBC was unable to immediately confirm the report.

It comes after the UC Browser was criticized on a TV show about misleading online medical advertising that was broadcast by CCTV, a state-owned broadcaster.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM.

m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.

m69ifj,,investing,post,1615902668,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['BLK', 'NDAQ', 'UPS']"

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

**[Recent 1Q21 Earnings](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/) - 02/03/21**

* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.

Being able to sell fertilizer for $20 a bag and dirt for $5 a bag is no easy task but they do it.  The problem is see here is transferring those skills to the marijuana play.  Marketing the way Scott’s does won’t work the same way and it may actually form part of the regulations that come out on legalization.  The government wants the revenues but they don’t want giant dope leaf advertising everywhere.  The subdued nature of the rollout will restrict their upside and not allow them to play to their strengths.  Time and acceptance of the new market may change this however.,

m6j8i0,,investing,post,1615928302,"Google Play to Slash Fees App Developers Payhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/google-play-to-slash-fees-app-developers-pay-51615922419

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

Q4 earnings miss GAAP EPS off by 7.7%.  FCF analysis puts fair value at $134.  DCF EPS even lower.

It doesn't matter that they had a strong quarter.  What matters is that they set an expectation with investors and missed it by almost 8% or 11.7 cents per share (~$311 million total) in a year where they had been beating earnings by double digit percentages and hadn't had an EPS miss since Q4 2020.  Prices were moving on that expectation and when it failed to materialize, investors penalized WMT.

This continues to further Graham and Buffett's view that stocks trading in excess of their fair value are more susceptible to downward pressure particularly when the market is pricing in earnings that don't materialize as expected.   It should be noted that Buffett doesn't ""buy the ... dip"".... He looks for securities that are trading well below their fair value, typically 30 to 50% below fair value rather than right on the cusp of it, regardless of price movements in relation to near-term highs.",['WMT']

m60b98,,investing,post,1615866531,"I have to be missing something about the EV spaceI have been in the markets since college, about 6 years ago. I am not an expert and have my fair share of misses. This isnt a typical ""doomsday"" post. In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players.","['TSLA', 'GM', 'ICE']"

m60b98,gr3r6j2,investing,comment,1615884824,"This was an honest question, and I will do my best at giving an honest, non-hype no BS answer as good practice to articulate my thoughts on the space. (*Disclaimer:* I could be defined as a mega-bull on the what I'll call broadly the 'electrification' opportunity that faces the world in the 1-2 coming **decades,** EVs being a big part of that). I'll start with my thoughts and then answer your questions. I also work in the space, and have been following it as an energy nerd for...a long time).

I would say **I am very concerned** about the 'EV froth' right now. With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

&#x200B;

I know its been long, but I hope it was worthy of the read. I can always write and share more if there are specific questions.

Edit: And answering your high level question about what you are missing, its that in my view and what I've seen, TSLA has been the one that has derisked a lot of the market and made the manufacturing progress (turning clearly cash flow positive forward looking as of January 2020....hmm) where they have crossed the chasm and are now on, a product manufacturing driven rocket ship. These other companies and the space have enjoyed the rising tides, hype, capital, and knowledge that it is possible. Then comes, the greed, the frauds, the bubble, and the damage. When the tide goes out, who will have no clothes? That is the core of what I think you might be missing about the space.","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

the dividend is is $1 per share with it you can buy 10 shares

if the price goes up to  $20 what would change?

well the market cap would change to 20 thousand but the outstanding shares stayed the same :(

but your dividend percentage would also change :( to 5%

so your dividend would be the (market cap \* the percentage) / the number of shares 1000) \* the amount of shares you own would be still be $100  woot same money!

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",
m6iaod,gr68t4c,investing,comment,1615932838,"The company decides what to do with their budget.   

Some spend all their money (wisely or not).  The goal is to grow the business,  build another factory, or buy more trucks or whatever.   Sometimes that means buy a smaller company.   If they grow wisely,  the value of the stock goes up.

Some try to grow, but slowly,  maybe there aren't any good opportunities at the time so they could buy back their stock with the extra cash.  This makes the value of the stock go up. 

Some return the money to the shareholders as dividends. 

You can find different combinations of these.  Some growing companies may periodically pay a one off special dividend. Others pay a small but routine dividend, and grow or buy back shares depending on opportunities.   Others just keep stable and pay most of the profits as dividends, and as the years roll on with inflation they will try to raise the dividend every year. 

Each of the attract different types of investors so they try to stick with a strategy. For example, retired people like to count on dividends as income so you see utilities finance growth with bonds and maintain the dividend because if they cut the dividend those people would all sell.  Cyclical companies pay dividends in good times and cut it in down cycles.",

**Introduction** 

During a casual scroll through the dregs of Robinhood, I stumbled upon a listing that caught my eye: Future Fintech ($FTFT), a China-based “blockchain e-commerce financial technology company” that’s up an impressive 455% over the past year. Featuring a market cap of \~$500m and share price of \~$5.50 (at the time of discovery), it appeared at first glance to be a player in a hot sector with plenty of room to run. I decided to do a deep-dive into their history, products, and SEC filings as an exercise in due diligence.  

What I found was bewildering – and a great lesson in why doing your own thorough research before investing is vital. Let’s take a look at what I found. 

**A Brief Company History** 

$FTFT wasn’t always a pioneer in one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. Before pivoting to blockchain, e-commerce and crypto in 2018, $FTFT produced and sold fruit juice - yes, seriously - as SkyPeople Foods Holding Ltd. (“SkyPeople”). The carcass of the company dates all the way back to 1998, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on their recent history. 

SkyPeople was brought onto the NASDAQ via secondary offering through underwriters Rodman & Renshaw (featured in the documentary *The China Hustle*), who have a history of bringing sketchy Chinese microcap companies to market and [violating Finra rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/finra-fines-rodman-renshaw-for-analysts-actions.html). Interestingly, SkyPeople settled a [$2.2m class action lawsuit](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf) (.pdf link) in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1,000%** and failing to disclose a **related-party transaction** involving their former CFO, Yongke Xue (now board chairman), to shareholders. 

According to their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm), the transition to their latest business focus hasn’t been going so well: “The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised **substantial doubts about its ability to continue** as a going concern” (pg. 7). As of September 30, 2020, positive operating cashflows were predominantly related to stock compensation and discontinued operations – not their stated core business (pg. 3). The quick ratio for their 3Q2020 financials (0.057) indicates that the company doesn’t have adequate liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities. 

  
Compounding their troubles is a **subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement** issued on February 21, 2020, addressing their accounting practices, management oversight, and the sale of one of their subsidiaries (pg. 16). Note that this critical piece of information is missing from their website’s [news page](http://ftft.top/en/news.html). 

Their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm) \- the last one filed with the SEC - details their routine, schizophrenic changes in name and business focus since 1998, as well as their suspiciously complicated and web-like organizational structure, portrayed on a [chart](https://imgur.com/PNFqHLj) (pg. 4) featuring font so small that it’s impossible to read.  

In addition to being an industry leader in juice production and blockchain technology, $FTFT is also an innovator in taking out loans, leases, and service contracts, defaulting on them, and getting slapped with judgements in court, boasting an impressive record of [**20 defaults and lawsuits**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006) in six years (2014-2019, pgs. 42-45).  Furthermore, they’ve regularly been in danger of being delisted by NASDAQ due to their **persistent failure to file reports on time** (pg. 40). 

Now that we’ve scratched the surface of this industry heavyweight’s complex history, let’s examine $FTFT’s products and services. 

**Blockchain, E-Commerce, and Crypto – Oh My!** 

According to $FTFT’s website, [www.ftft.top](http://www.ftft.top/), their core revenue generators revolve around blockchain-enabled e-commerce. We’ll take a brief, critical look at each of them below. 

**“Chain Cloud Mall”,** AKA “GK Shared Mall” ([www.gksharedmall.com](http://www.gksharedmall.com/)), is described on their website as an “...innovative B2B2C e-commerce platform created by well-known investment bankers, e-commerce and blockchain technology industry elites, financial technology experts, and sharing economy scholars."" In reality, it appears to be a standard, boring retail platform, absent of any evidence whatsoever that blockchain & fintech “experts” and “scholars” were involved in its creation, or that blockchain technology is even in place at all. It’s replete with dead links and has seemingly little engagement. In fact, according to their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm), it generated an abysmal **$0.54m** in revenue from a total of **6,401 users**. 

**“NONOGIRL”** is a “cross-border e-commerce platform” that, in reality, appears to be a standard-web auction site that was seemingly [abandoned 7 months ago](https://imgur.com/aH4B94h) according to the NONOGIRL LinkedIn page. It’s unclear if the site was ever launched; searches on [www.baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com/) and the Google Play Store return no direct results to the platform. 

**“DCON”** is a “blockchain-based application incubator and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets” that appears to be dead in the water, as [the associated coin never appears to have been released](https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R). No development updates are available on $FTFT’s website for either the “incubator” project or the DCON platform itself. 

**Conclusion** 

All publicly available evidence points toward this name being an incredibly risky investment with a hefty amount of downside looming overhead. Major red flags abound – and to those holding long positions in this company: **invest with caution**.

All SEC filings can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/ciks=0001066923&entityName=Future%2520FinTech%2520Group%2520Inc.%2520(FTFT)%2520(CIK%25200001066923)). Thanks for reading.","['PG', 'NDAQ', 'PM', 'GOOGL']"

m5kkxa,,investing,post,1615814594,"Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

m58453,,investing,post,1615767209,"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely workedhttps://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",['TGT']

m592rq,,investing,post,1615770312,"Equity-Based Dollar-Cost Averaging: Methodically Buying Dips and Taking Profits Anyone who spent some time studying the basics of investing knows about dollar-cost averaging. If anyone needs a refresher, here's a short analysis between lump-sum versus averaging by Vanguard: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum).

Vanguard makes a compelling case about market timing. Assuming a retail trader can't time the market (even if you don't support EMH, it still is obvious that this is pretty darn difficult), you may believe it's simply for those who are scared of realizing losses, which is exactly the point they make.

I would like to propose a slight tweak to the concept: instead of spreading the payments out over time, spread them out over price. You start with an initial exposure, and scale up when the market takes a hit, while scaling down to take profits during bull runs.

Let's demonstrate why this works out. Take a random price point the SPY has reached in the past: 250 USD. How many times did it reach this point? Five times. Take another one, 270 USD: **ten times.** How about 290 USD? **Fourteen times.** But maybe that's just a recent trend. Things might've been different back when it was around 100 USD, right? Nope, **ten times it reached 100 USD.**

I haven't conducted an elaborate backtest, but it's clear the amount of setbacks to any particular price level is rather large, just as it's clear the whole thing is positively drifting in general.

Given that we know this, instead of investing 100% at once, consider what would happen if you invested 60% at 100 USD and invested an extra 20% for every 10% drawdown, and scaled down by 5% for every 10% increase? In other words, we scale up by double the drawdown, and realize half of our profits.

Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash. We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

We could continue to test and demonstrate this, but the point is clear; we all know this will generate less returns in a very strong bull market, and create very strong opportunities in bear markets. We profit when bull runs are facing continous corrections, when the market goes sideways with some swings in between, and we are extremely well-protected against crashes, able to purchase lows and hold whole multiples of shares compared to when we'd just lump-sum.

It's no coincidence the greats such as Warren Buffet hold so much of their available capital in cash and play the waiting game on crashing markets. Ask yourself: when the markets crashed by 50+% over the course of their history, did it ever correspond with a similar collapse of the global economy? Not really, jobs were lost, consumer spending took a hit, some companies went under, but at a global scale we never took a hit even in the same universe as the rate at which the market tanks during those times.

So what's your take on this? Is this even considered ""dollar-cost averaging""? Are there superior alternatives? Or would you consider / are you already applying this in your actual investment strategies? Would very much like to further my knowledge on this topic.",

m5czmg,,investing,post,1615783643,"$SESN (Sesen Bio) D&D huge incoming catalysts with mayor impact on bladder cancer.
Today I´m bringing you all my third D&D. There will be no technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some information research and maybe you find it helpful. 

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

Before you ask, I currently hold 3652 shares at an average cost of 2.32.

**About the company:**

Sesen Bio is a late-stage company developing fusion protein medicines. Their fusion protein approach tethers a tumor-targeting antibody fragment to a protein cytotoxic payload to form a single protein molecule designed to selectively and broadly kill cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells and to activating the body’s innate immune response system.

**What are they doing and why I think it´s important:**

The company is initially focused on the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Their main drug is it’s called **Vicineum.** This is being evaluated in the [**Phase 3 VISTA** trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02449239?term=vicinium&rank=1) for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have been previously treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the current standard of care for NMIBC. While BCG is effective in many patients, challenges with tolerability have been observed and many patients will experience recurrence of the disease. If BCG is not effective or a patient can no longer receive BCG, the recommended option for treatment is radical cystectomy, the complete removal of the bladder.

*In case you ask how many people are vaccinated with the BCG feel free to click this link:* [*http://www.bcgatlas.org/*](http://www.bcgatlas.org/)*.*

The preliminary findings are highly encouraging, demonstrating that treatment with Vicineum results in clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability. In addition, the data are consistent with the results of Vicineum in their completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

&#x200B;

**Vicineum** can potentially treat **head and neck cancer.** They have completed Phase 1 trials for an injectable form of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN that have demonstrated anti-tumor activity and safety. Data from these trials also demonstrated that certain patients who were injected with Vicineum in one tumor had responses in non-injected tumors as well, suggesting that Vicineum may promote an anti-tumor immune response and combine well with immunotherapies. In addition to the Phase 1 trials, Sesen Bio completed a Phase 2 trial in the United States, which demonstrated a reduction in the bidirectional size of the principle targeted tumor observed in 71 percent (10/14) of patients evaluated in the study.

**Some important fact about Bladder Cancer:**

\- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. If BCG is not effective one of the options is **complete bladder removal.** Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer, but options for treatment have not changed in more than 20 years. At Sesen Bio, they want to help you save your bladder. **Vicineum**™, is administered in the exact same way as BCG but works differently and may offer a new option.

\- This year, an estimated 83,730 adults (64,280 men and 19,450 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Smoking accounts for 47% of all these cases.

\- Bladder cancer mostly affects older people. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are older than 55. The average age people are diagnosed with bladder cancer is 73.

\- The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The general 5-year survival rate for people with bladder cancer is 77%. If the tumor is invasive but has not yet spread outside the bladder, the 5-year survival rate is 69%. Approximately 33% of bladders cancers are diagnosed at this stage.

**Why I´m very bullish and this and analysts are too:**

\- Since 2006 the Oncology Products Reviewed by FDA that have a BLA Submission (as Vicineum has) have a Probability of Approval of 82%.

\- **Forward-looking Timeline for Vicineum**

Positive progress in the US and Europe enables a clear regulatory path forward with the following anticipated milestones:

\- **Potential for Peak Revenue of $1B - $3B Globally for Vicineum**

Substantial US opportunity and OUS potential of roughly two times the US.

An anticipated virtuous cycle of advocacy across physicians, patients/caregivers, and payers to drive rapid uptake and strong growth after approval and launch.

Compelling intent to prescribe research in the US.

A highly concentrated US market of \~1,500 Urologists treating \~75% of BCG patients allows for efficient targeting.

\- **Key partnership with leading partner in MENA (Hikma Pharmaceuticals)**

A public company headquartered in London with a market cap of >$6B and >$2B in annual revenue.

The fifth-largest pharma company in the MENA region trusted and leading licensing partner in the region and extensive regulatory affairs capabilities.

**My opinion on all this:**

Vicineum appears to be the new great thing around bladder cancer, numbers are showing to be great and this is close to receiving an FDA response which is expected to be positive. This is the 6th most common cancer and if the BCG fails the most common treatment is bladder removal. Sesen is trying to avoid this by providing a great solution. The company is partnered around the world to provide this once approved and is aiming beyond the USA. The balance sheet looks impeccable, no debt, 44M free, indicators look great for the short, mid, and long-range with a huge upside on a price target. 

I see this having some big news soon and driving the price very high up. 

Another important thing is that there are not many videos or spam around it so the price isn´t pumped in my opinion. 

There is a BCG shortage which might help Sesen Bio get their drug approved even faster. This shortage has been going for some years now. 

I will not buy more shares as I already own a lot but I see this as a great investment.

Even on really simple cases of a few shares bought a year ago and never traded at any point later, the cost basis is just... wrong? For my entire portfolio, plus a few dollars/share here, minus a few dollars/share there, not really any reasoning for any of it, but definitely an overall much lower total cost basis than actually should have been there.

If you haven’t left Robinhood yet, get out. This kind of technical incompetence isn’t just embarrassing, it’s scary. You don’t want to keep your money in a clown car.

Edit: For those saying they never received cost basis, note that I only received mine more than a full month later and after I sold some shares - the transfers went through on 2/5-2/8 and I got a statement indicating cost basis was updated on 3/10 for shares which I'd sold (and cost basis information appeared on all other shares). Somehow the date in the cost basis is correct on Vanguard, but the amounts are wonky (roughly the date of the transfer, but the purchase date is correct for some, for others random values).

My goal is to put together an aggressive portfolio until I am about 50 years old. Since I do not trust my ability to time the market on anything, I am planning to stick firmly to my plan and rebalance it once a year. For an aggressive, diversified portfolio, I am thinking of doing the following:

# Understanding the eVTOL Space

(Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag)

Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a moo*o* point.

Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the *same per mile as a ground-based ride share*.

Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check [this article](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/evtol-air-taxi-flying-car-market-players/) to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) *or* are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded [DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lwj8rs/a_world_of_evtols_a_comparison_of/) that I highly recommend checking out.

The United States is acutely aware that it ['missed the boat'](https://www.osinto.com/post/agility-prime-the-pentagon-s-evtol-power-play) on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the [Department of Defense.](https://dod.defense.gov/) Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched **Agility Prime**, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their [website](https://agilityprime.com/index.html?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=AgilityPrime#/) here and highly recommend reading this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-flying-cars-could-take-off-soon-if-we-let-the-military-help/) by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from *the Jetsons.*

The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a **TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM**, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario.

Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at **$1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S**. Joby Aviation cited the [2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/bah-uam-executive-briefing-to-post.pdf) for its forecasts.

Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities:

1. **Batteries!!** \- Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's *ludicrous* mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. [Alakai Skai](https://www.skai.co/)'s (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services
2. **Certification** \- These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause.
3. **Safety** \- To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. *It will be complicated to write software* to reliably control all that, [says Ella Atkins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/02/10/lilium-evtol-spac-air-taxi/?sh=33d80b54627c), an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. *“You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,”* says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone.
4. **Air Traffic Control** \- Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of *skyports/ vertiports* dotted around an urban area.
5. **Public Perception** \- Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, *“*[*lasing*](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws/)*”* of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only.

All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space:

1. **Joby Aviation - $RTP** (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play)
2. **Blade - $EXPC** (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play)

# Outlook for EXPC and RTP

**Blade - EXPC**

[Investor's presentation](https://brs-apartments.flyblade.com/blade/production/uploaded-assets/1608040247.pdf)

* **Blade is an eVTOL index play**, often thought as the *""*[*Uber of skies*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-small-aviation-tech-company-will-turn-into-the-uber-of-the-skies-2021-01-11)*""* operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform.
* **Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable**; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products.
* There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to ***selling shovels in a gold rush.***
* Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. **This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow**.”
* **Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities** that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent).
* **Blade operates in four key lines of business:**
   * *Short Distance* – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders).
   * *BLADE Airport* – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 .
   * *BLADE MediMobility* – **Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States**, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers.
   * *International Joint Ventures* – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. **Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India** flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi.
   * The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo).
* **Blade's projected revenue outlook**:
   * Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million.
   * Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. **This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026**. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then.
   * But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt)
* **Blade's Competitive Moat**:
   * **BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility.**
   * **#1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets**, brings credibility to new market expansion.
   * **Strong management team with domain expertise** and public market experience.
   * **BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies** to generate attractive growth opportunities.
   * Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables **flight volume growth** and **accelerates launch timeline for new markets**
   * While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and **it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost** (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.
* **ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares**, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares.
* **Leadership:** Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.
* **Board of Directors** upon completion of transaction:
   * Eric Affeldt, Chief Executive Officer of Experience Investment Corp. and previously CEO of publicly-traded ClubCorp
   * Jane Garvey, former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.
   * Kenneth Lerer, Managing Partner of Lerer Hippeau, Co-Founder of Huffington Post, and former Director of Viacom, Inc.
   * Susan Lyne, Co-founder and General Partner of BBG Ventures and former President of ABC Entertainment Group, a division of the Walt Disney Company
   * Ted Philip, Lead Independent Director of United Airlines Holdings, Inc. and Lead Independent Director of Hasbro, Inc.

   * David Zaslav, Chief Executive Officer of Discovery, Inc. and Director of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., and Grupo Televisa, S.A.B.
* **Investors - Strategic / Institutional Venture Capital:**
   * **Airbus**

* 82.5MM \* $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap
* PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash)
* Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is **7.4x.** On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers.
* Unadjusted:
   * 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be **$402MM** (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number).
   * This means that the **unadjusted** **EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales**. That is very low.
   * This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$3.35 billion**.
   * That is **215%** **above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61**
* Adjusted:
   * We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The **present value sales number is $230 million** (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%).
   * As a result, the **adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x** (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million).
   * This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$2.077 billion**.
   * That is **95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2**
* Average between adjusted and unadjusted:
   * Target market value is $2.713 billion.
   * **Fair share price: $32.89**

**Conclusion:** ***EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9*** *(As of 03/14/2021)*

This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement.

**Joby - RTP (Speculation)**

* It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.)
* Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of *saving a billion people an hour a day.*
* Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months.
* Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months.
* ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category.

# How I am playing EXPC and RTP

* Catalysts:
   * ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play
   * EXPC - A lot of spec predictions [floating around](https://mobile.twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1368222379080638467) about the shareholder vote on 3/31
   * Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound.
* Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow.
* I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well.
* Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting.

**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor**, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

In other words, I think this space has a lot of potential to become something of a future bubble / hype sector, but also become a very real and profitable space as well. I like the long term potential of EVTOL more than electric cars since I believe there will be far better moats here with a lot less competition. Also has some potential for future crossover with defense industry.

Not saying I would go whole hog on this, but I picked up some warrants as a speculative play on RTX after the SPAC shares crashed back to being close to the initial $10 value.  In my view, the long-term warrants (expire in 2027) present an opportunity for a LOT of upside, where the downside is not necessarily that high.

In other words, I think that ***right now,*** the risk assymetry is heavily skewed to the upside.

That being said, unless WSB catches onto hype in this sector, I'm not sure I would want to play these short term. I would not buy options on these here personally. Overall, I think the macro headwinds to growth stocks is going to be a little bit tough over the next  few quarters. It'll probably help that these are small caps, but I still think these are best viewed as speculative long term call options on a potential new disruptive technology.",['RTX']

Through this latest phase, the company has invested in additional options that allow shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

Schneider has expanded its technology lineup of Schneider FreightPower, first announced mid-year 2020, to help shippers save time and increase their access to capacity. The company rolled out the accompanying app to carriers in Fall 2020.

Through this latest phase, Schneider FreightPower aims to provide shippers with options to manage their businesses right at their fingertips. The digital marketplace allows shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

“Our goal is to make Schneider FreightPower the digital access point for services and solutions for both shippers and carriers,” said Mark Rourke, president and CEO of Schneider. “Shippers of all sizes come to us with their toughest transportation challenges, and we are solving them faster than ever before. That means our customers get more value – and get more done in a day.”

Schneider FreightPower offers access to tools such as:Instantly quote and bookFreight visibility 24/7 (load in process, last location, pickup and ETA), including email notifications (pickups, deliveries, and specific order completion)Access to load documentsReal-time reporting


“Schneider FreightPower is an exciting, new way to differentiate Schneider and connect to small shippers and carriers which represent a $1.2 trillion segment of the transportation market,” said Rourke. “We are giving shippers time, solutions and the best at what we deliver— access to full Schneider capabilities and options. It’s all about improving capacity, so shippers can do business better than ever before,” said Rourke.

m5s8un,,investing,post,1615835255,"$IGIC is a sleeper company that is DEEPLY undervalued 

**$IGIC (commons) & $IGICW (warrants)**

* Growing at 31% YoY
* Extremely Moaty Specialty Insurance Business
* Family-owned company (\~29% of outstanding shares)
* No debt
* Not affected negatively by Covid (so not dependent upon reopening)
* Specialized insurance (high profit margins)
* Insurance rates are the highest they've ever been (we're seeing 20-30% gains in premiums)
* Profitable
* 20 Year old business
* Founder still very active in the company (he's 87)
* Pays a dividend
* $380m in cash (their M.C. is $345m CRAZY)
* Repurchasing shares
* Has warrants (they're a 1-1 with an $11.50 Strike)

They mainly write insurance in the Middle East (Jabsheh family is well respected and are a real value add. However they've recently added N.A. and did 30m in premiums last quarter).

**Company History:**

I spoke to IR (investor relations) she said she won't leave the company until she fixes the volume problem. She's the only employee that's worked for a public company, so the old guard is a bit difficult to talk with. The owner is a big baller, he's worth 100m all from the company. Started it 20 years ago, he's 87 and still goes to work everyday. You can set up a investor call with him at 8pm at night (his time), you'll catch him smoking a cigar and drinking scotch. Fucking chad.

**So what's the problem?**

A couple of things... $IGIC went public via a SP4C on March 22nd, 2020. The SPAC offering was at \~$10 the market Armageddon that ensued caused them to drop below $7 and they've traded sideways since then. The original investors (Argo Group being the largest one) would like to exit their position but they are unable to for 2 reasons.

1. Lockup period ends in March, it's any day now that the SP4C lockup ends.
2. They won't sell at a loss. Until this thing moves above $10 you won't see a real marketplace exist for it... This stock needs liquidity and we can provide that to create a real marketplace for it.

**Let's talk fundamentals are valuations...**

These types of business' are valued on their book. Let's take a look at where $IGIC stands relative to it's competitors.

As you can see $IGIC is trading a multiple of .87x price-to-book relative to $KNSL which is 10.15x price-to-book. $IGIC is growing almost as quickly as $KNSL. $IGIC is profitable, in it for the long run, growing quickly, and way underappreciated.

**Conservative PT:** $12 or \~1.5x price-to-book

**PT:** $30 or \~4x price-to-book

**Bullcase PT:** \~$70 or \~10x price-to-book

As you can see this is anywhere from a 2 bagger to a 10 bagger. I am very long $IGIC and am excited for the liquidity and volume issues to be resolved. When this has a real marketplace this stock will move... quickly.

**Positions:**

25,000 commons @ $7.5

10,000 warrants @ $.72",['IR']

m4y0mb,,investing,post,1615738368,"Why I think Mohawk Group Holdings ($MWK) is a Great Long Term Play.Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool ""AIMEE"" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and increasing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.

Some of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6

In a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&G, Unilever, etc.).

To put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become ""Super Heros"" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the financials:

Currently at the price of $35\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.

While the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&A targets. Direct quote from earnings:

*""We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&A targets that in total have trailing twelve month’s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month’s EBITDA of $97 million.""*

These deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.

I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.

&#x200B;

It is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:

1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them
2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution
3. Competitors

For the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.

On the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.

To the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.

m4vzjt,,investing,post,1615731956,"Good Rx (GDRX) - is a GOOD investmentOn Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality.","['AMZN', 'WMT']"

m4ghin,,investing,post,1615672644,"Long commodities, short bonds. Protection against inflation, and the house of cards that is the US bond market.Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

[https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc](https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc) 

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

m4j5zg,,investing,post,1615680574,"Mini-Index Fund Strategy (With Backtested Results)A little while ago I read this article from the WSJ: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871)

The article talks about how since trading fees are so low, and it’s easier than ever to own one share, why not buy shares one at a time. It posed the idea of a mini-index fund that you could make just for yourself. *Rather than buy SPY, just buy one share of each of its components*. I always thought the idea novel when you consider the diseconomies of scale in the asset management industry. So I decided to test out the idea with backtesting.

\-I’ll be testing the mini-index fund strategy with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI)

\-I’ll be using DIA as the comparable passive instrument.

\-Using QuantConnect as my backtesting environment.

\-To simulate round-trip trading costs, I liquidate holdings at end of all backtests.

\-To further try to simulate real-world conditions, all backtests will have some excess cash, but not too much as if a real person was funding an investment account to buy something they already thought out. For example, if you want to buy one share of DIA at $286.00 you might deposit $300.00 in your account. Or if you need $4873.00 to buy one share of all the constituents of the DJI, you might round off your deposit at $4900.00.

**Limitations/Things I’d try to incorporate if I wanted to explore this more**

\- All buying happened at the start of the backtesting period. A more realistic scenario to mimic small retail investors would be progressive buying as time goes on.

\- Fees are based on the IBKR brokerage model, NOT INCLUDING IBKR LITE. I would like to simulate zero-fee trading, but the trick with that is that I’d have to account for costs associated with the sometimes less than optimal trade execution that is known to occur with “free” brokerages. And those costs are hard to measure.

\- I did not use a price-weighting allocation yet. What I would do next is see how an exact copy of the DIA would perform.

\- My Backtest period is not that long. Less than a year. It starts 8-31-20 because that is the date when the DJI components last changed and ends on 3-13-21. If I wanted to spend some money on a data source that provides constituent information on indices, I could make the backtest period longer. There are ways to get that info without paying, but I’m only an amateur at python.

\- DJA is very limited, I’d rather do this test on the S&P500. Once again, need a clean data source to do that without a whole lot of headaches.

&#x200B;

The Results

[Backtest 1 (Benchmark) - 1 share of DIA](https://imgur.com/WYlJjAt)

Here we have the performance of just one share of DIA. I ran a full backtest on the benchmark because I wanted to see the effects of fees and cash drag on performance. Since we dealing with such low quantities a few dollars from either of those would have a meaningful effect. So the number to beat is 12.5%.

[Backtest 2 - 100 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/aOl8qQ5)

For the first backtest I just want to simply see what adding some scale to the portfolio would do. So instead of 1 share of DIA, we have 100. Sure enough, we got more than a whole percentage point in return. Nothing too surprising. The new number to beat: 13.83%.

[Backtest 3 - 1 share of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/syP1yos)

Now we created a portfolio with simply 1 share of every DJI constituent. Its return is very close to the return from Backtest 1 which was 12.5%. I suspect that if you did this strategy with a zero-commission account you might actually beat the 1-share DIA strategy. By how much, hard to say. However, still would be a losing strategy when compared to 100-shares DIA.

Same idea with Backtest 2. I want to see how adding a little scale would change things. Sure enough, performs very closely to Backtest 2 – 100 shares of DIA strategy. Doesn’t beat it, but I suspect it might in a zero-fee environment by just a small amount. Of course, this is also the strategy that requires the most capital to implement just to buy all the pieces. So, it wouldn’t be the most practical strategy for most people.

[Backtest 5 - 1000 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/lVxwWnp)

Since Backtest 2 performed the best, I wanted to see the effect of even adding more scale, this time with 1000 shares. No doubt we have some diminishing returns. We were able to eke out just 1 basis point for an extra 300k of capital.

**Conclusions:**

Based on what I’m seeing, there doesn’t seem to much of a case for the Mini-Index Fund strategy. You’re still better off with just the proper ETF. Not ready to close the book on this just yet. Given time, I would like to test certain conditions that might have the Mini-Index Fund Strategy win at the end.","['DOW', 'SPGI', 'PGR']"

m4qnp9,,investing,post,1615707348,"AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader# Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $210 Million
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion.","['CARR', 'FB', 'ORCL', 'PH', 'PEG']"

Morgan Stanley boosted their price objective on shares of Berkeley Lights from $65.00 to $80.00 and gave the company an ""equal weight"" rating in a research report on Monday, November 16th.

**Who is Ping An Good Doctor?**

Established in 2014 and listed on the Hong King Stock Exchange in April 2018 **Ping An Good Doctor**, formerly known as **Ping An Healthcare and Technology,** is a health care software company. The Company offers a mobile platform for online consultations, hospital referrals and appointments, health management, and wellness interaction services. In addition, it connects individual consumers with health care resources. Ping An Healthcare and Technology is headquartered in Shanghai, China. Its parent company Ping An is the world largest insurance company in terms of assets and market capitalization

**What is the growth potential of the Digital Health market?**

The global Digital Health market is expected to witness a 37.1% spike in growth in the year 2021 and [thereafter will continue to grow and reach US$508.8 billion by the year 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/25/2133473/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Report-2020-Market-is-Expected-to-Witness-a-37-1-Spike-in-Growth-in-2021-and-will-Continue-to-Grow-and-Reach-US-508-8-Billion-by-2027.html), trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 18.8% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. Non-COVID-19 healthcare has massively migrated to digital platforms in 2020. From telemedicine to remote patient monitoring & management, new service delivery platforms have been adopted at lightning speeds.

The global telemedicine market size was estimated at USD 55.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a [CAGR of 22.4% from 2021 to 2028.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/telemedicine-industry) The market holds many opportunities to grow during the forecast period owing to the lack of access to care and rising provider adoption of telemedicine, rising consumer demand and patient acceptance, and enhanced quality of care. 

Especially in China the sharp growth for the online healthcare sector is expected to continue in the following years. [Ping An Healthcare has quoted industry](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) estimates in its FY 2020 results presentation slides, which suggest that the penetration rate of online medical services in China could potentially expand from 5% in 2020 to 16% in 2025. This implies that Ping An Healthcare's online medical services business has a long growth runway ahead.

**Why Ping An Good Doctor?**
**Rapid User Growth** 

The company [grew rapidly in 2020](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF). As of December 31, 2020 Ping An Good Doctor had 373 million registered users (+18% YoY), 72.62 million Monthly Active Users (+8.5% YoY), 3.98 million monthly paying users (+34.1% YoY) and average daily consultations reaching 903,000 (+23.9 YoY) with network coverage including 3,700+ hospitals and 151,000 collaborated pharmacy outlets in 379 cities in 32 provinces. 

**Good Financial results in 2020**

Ping An Good Doctors[financial performance was good](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year with strong top line growth, improved profitability at the gross margin level, and narrowing losses.

The company's revenue increased by +36% YoY from RMB5,065 million in FY 2019 to RMB6,866 million in FY 2020. In terms of profitability, Ping An Healthcare's gross profit margin expanded by +410 basis points from 23.1% in FY 2019 to 27.2% in FY 2020. Furthermore, Ping An Good Doctor\`s net loss adjusted for share option expenses and foreign exchange, was reduced from -RMB695 million in FY 2019 to -RMB516 million in FY 2020.

**Who is the competition?**

This puts Ping An Healthcare as one of the three major Chinese internet healthcare companies alongside Alibaba Health Information Technology Limited (OTCPK:ALBHF) \[241:HK\] and JD Health International Inc (OTCPK:JDHIF) (OTCPK:JDHIY) \[6688:HK\]. Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (OTCPK:PNGAY) (OTCPK:PIAIF) \[2318:HK\] is Ping An Healthcare's parent with a 38.4% equity interest, while Alibaba Health Information Technology and JD Health are backed by Alibaba Group (BABA) and JD.com (JD), respectively.

**Ping An Good Doctor profits more from the digital health market than its competitor.** [23 %](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) of Ping An Good Doctors revenue came from its online medical services segment (compared to 17% in 2019) and 47% of its Gross profit (+15 pps YoY) In contrast, Alibaba Health generated approximately [97%](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/alihealth/interim/2021/int.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of the company's 1H FY 2021 (YE March 31) revenue from pharmaceutical direct sales & e-commerce businesses, while sales for the pharmaceutical retail business (including direct and third-party platform) represented [94%](https://files.services/files/586/2020/1126/20201126070002_75568423_en.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of JD Health's 1H 2020 revenue.

In other words, Ping An Good Doctor\`s is a better proxy for the growth of online medical services in China, while Alibaba Health and JD Health are seen as plays on the country's pharmaceutical retail industry.

Notably, Ping An Good Doctor\`s online medical services business segment saw +82% YoY revenue growth last year, which was much higher than the company's overall top line growth and the sales growth of its other business segments. This validates my view with regards to the growth potential of the online medical services industry in China.

It is also noteworthy that the company's online medical services business led the improvement in gross profitability. The gross profit margin of Ping An Healthcare's online medical services improved by +12.0 percentage points YoY to [56.2%](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year.

A favorable revenue mix with an increased sales contribution from higher-margin online medical services drove Ping An Healthcare's overall gross profit margin expansion in FY 2020. In comparison, the company's health management & wellness interaction segment saw YoY declines in gross margin in FY 2020.

**What are the risks?**

**Chinese market as a risk**

While investing in Chinese companies you must keep in mind that even tough the state leaves many companies alone, provided they don´t get involved in politics, the recently cancelled IPO of Ant Financial serves as a reminder that the government can do whatever it wants. Changes in regulatory policies could be negative for Chinese internet health care player. 

Also, Chinese companies saw some red days recently due to speculation that the government might now be able to maintain such high levels of Covid stimulus. But this would only have a short-term effect on the stock. 

**Market risks**

Certain challenges faced by this industry are resistance in technology acceptance by practitioners and patients, high cost of implementation, and data privacy and safety issues. These factors may hamper the accelerating growth to a certain extent. 

**Company risks**

Even though Ping An Good Doctor grew rapidly over the last year it’s never been profitable. This is expected to change within the next couple of years but a longer-than-expected time for the company as a whole and its online medical services business to be profitable poses a risk.

**Is it a good time to buy now?** 

After ARK Investments Management revealed that the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF initiated a new position in Ping An Good Doctor, a $ 3 Billion price surge was sparked but short lived. Right now the price is back to normal and Cathie bought 1 Million more shares on Thursday. As this being a longterm investment I don’t think that there is a need to rush in the stock. I believe it\`s at its fair value at the moment and something to keep an eye on and on the Watchlist.

&#x200B;

If you are not familiar with the company, they are an Australia-based online custom print-on-demand marketplace, (selling to the US and UK/EU predominantly), which in my opinion was very well positioned at the beginning of the pandemic, which gave it even more momentum forward.

I personally use them both as a customer and as a seller and am well impressed with both the seller interface and the quality of the goods. I got super interested now that the company posted their half-year report (apparently they don't do quarterlies at ASX) , which is the best in their history. +96% revenue growth, pre-tax profit up 118%, went long after I read it and the price dropped

Here are my views on Redbubble

PROS:

* ZERO debt - £130m cash balance
* 36% insider ownership (before CEO purchase)
* CEO spends 2 million AUD to buy shares after Feb earnings report (1.6m on loan, 400k out of pocket)
* Record braking HY report, all I see is growth and potential
* Operating expenses only up 23% vs 96% revenue growth, so they are becoming more efficient
* Massive affiliate marketing that seems to have traction // I DO mean massive if you search for passive income on Youtube, I bet some of the top hits will tell you to sell on Redbubble
* Actually making profit // first year of profit posted in the report, 42m vs -2m
* good market interface for both sellers and buyers // with good quality merchandise
* great customer experience and reviews
* Still relatively small 1.6B cap, a lot of room for growth IMO
* CEO said they won't pay dividends but reinvest everything for growth

CONS:

* Price of stock grew significantly since the 2020 bottom
* You might be exposed to multiple currencies - Their base is in AUD but predominantly sell in USD,GBP,EUR
* Price slid after the earnings report and positive outlook from CEO (WTF?), maybe anticipation was even higher?
* Trades @ ASX so might not be accessible for everyone. Market sentiment might also be different

Morgan Stanley had been quietly buying up 5% for a Japanese bank from October to mid-Feb. Not sure if this has any significance

m4dnp3,gr19ic9,investing,comment,1615829944,"Here are my major concerns with Redbubble.

\-It's a copyright disaster waiting to happen. Independent artists constantly have their design / brands ripped with bootleg merch. While these people have limited ability to fight against Redbubble (removing designs is a hassle, commission is already in the pocket of the thief, and many artists don't even know that their designs are up on the site), seeing that anybody from anywhere can upload any design, lawsuits from big brands is inevitable. Most of the designs that Redbubble recommends are recognizable logos, characters, movies, etc (namely from Disney).

\-Way too much competition. The influx of on demand printing is a huge issue for Redbubble, as it has nothing to differentiate itself from the other sites. It isn't cheaper than competitors, it doesn't have better quality products, but it is quick and easy. 

\-New artists and bots will flood the market with designs. While this doesn't negatively impact Redbubble directly, quantity will go up and quality will go down. Many artists have a hard time beating the recommended algorithm already, and have to rely solely on outside traffic. Not to mention the site's review system is flawed by having reviews being delegated to products rather than designs. This isn't healthy for an ecosystem of artists. 

&#x200B;

I do think on demand products / printing is the way of the future, but I don't have much faith in Redbubble specifically. It's just one of the many average options (except this one will be sued into oblivion if it gains steam).",

**Excerpt:** The economy did collapse back then, but the government did not blow its brains out on fiscal largesse. So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?

**Tl;dr:** There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade.

I'm not prone to being particularly for or against, but this is starting to look more like snake oil to me, despite making money off of it in the past directly or indirectly. Please understand I'm looking for alternative perspectives, and thank you in advance.

It doesn't seem to represent a good value store, to which it's proponents then turn around and say, it doesn't matter, its not that! Nor does it permit trading like a currency, given its sometimes wild volatility (how much am I paying for that pizza anyway), to which it's proponents again reassure me, don't worry, it's not that! Lastly, the hedge against a falling dollar/failing monetary policy argument - I don't see how a system to replace a fiat currency but which radically benefits original holders, meanwhile removing some of the variability of economic policy available today will be beneficial, and I can already foresee the argument of - oh but 'the man' devalues our dollar with monetary policy right now as he sees fit, but so too does the volatility of the asset as it trades.

So if it's none of them, what exactly is it we are after and speculating on? To me it seems we are saying that we value the asset for the anonymity as a vehicle of transfer between two people and the ultimate conversion (and valuation versus) a fiat currency that it brings, and perhaps the 'trust' we have all along the chain. I don't think we can go as far as stating it is quicker or more efficient than existing payment mechanisms.

In so far as the current price, I'm not uncertain it's not wild speculation albeit some rather clever friends are completely certain of its future, meanwhile I'm not sure whether they are transfixed and mislead or smart and ahead.",

m43dkq,gqtdid8,investing,comment,1615656261,"Trying to learn how to adult and I want to thank everyone for their advice in advance.  My wife and I live in the US, are 36 years of age, have one child with a combined gross income of $220,000.  We both max out our 401K to the IRS maximum, have three months savings in a high yield savings account and just recently paid off all our debt except for our home which is at 2.875%.  After overhead and saving for our son's college fund, we have a few grand left over every month.  

We recently opened up a brokerage account which we put these surplus funds into so it does something other than looking for fun things that we don't need.  If we decide to travel or need to make a ""major"" purchase our plan is not to dip into these funds but rather not contribute for X months.  

Depending on how things go, we may use these funds to purchase a second home (rental) however if the market tanks, we just won't do that.  As such, we believe our risk tolerance is pretty high.

Right now our portfolio consists primarily of VOO (80%) with a little of QQQ (6%), DIS (6%) and ARKK (2%).  The last 6% are what we consider our fun picks (AMC, CNBS, RBLX).

Our plan is to keep this strategy, depositing surplus every month, into our brokerage account with 80% of it being VOO or QQQ and the last 20% between DIS (my wife's pick), ARKK or other stocks/ETFs that we might think are worth putting money in.

As someone that has been doing this for approximately 9 months, I am looking for any feedback that you may have.  

Again, thank you in advance for your advice.","['ARKK', 'DIS']"
m43dkq,gqsyefi,investing,comment,1615648120,"So I’ve been thinking a lot about dividend vs growth investing and I think I’ve come to settle on dividend investing as the superior option. 

My reasoning is that even during periods of economic stagnation or even decline, that you’re still getting that dividend. Sure, it may be cut a bit, but you’re actively getting “gains” when the market isn’t going up. Isn’t this preferable to a situation where with growth stocks you will see absolutely no return, even losses, during the same periods? 

Another reason is that if you lose your job, you can redirect your dividends to your checking account and live off of that without needing to sell any of your base capital. 

To me dividend investing seems like the better risk management move as you are better off in stagnant or declining periods.",

**$LYTS - LSI Industries Inc. - Ever Been to a Gas Station - Bullish**

**What do they do**

* Based in Cleveland, OH, LSI makes industrial and outdoor lighting systems and accessories. These systems include gas station lighting and display/control systems (touch screens); outdoor sports lighting; and retail lighting systems.
* All products are made in the US which is an important moat for those sectors that require a Made in America designation such as federal contracts.
* The company was founded in 1976 and has grown through acquisitions to offer a broad and complete range of products and services for illumination and branding. As infrastructure spending increases and new developments flourish, both direct uses in retail and sports spaces and ancillary uses in gas stations/road stops will bolster LSI’s business.

**Why is it a good company**

* Improved margins last four quarters
* Doubled ROA and ROE YoY
* High OCF to Earnings ratio; real cash, not accounting
* Earnings growth QoQ; 100% increase YoY
* Decreased debt last eight quarters; debt coverage increased YoY
* Book equity has increased eight straight quarters.
* Enterprise value is less than the market cap

**Why is it a good stock**

* Greater than 90% free float; largest owner at \~8.5%
* Second quartile for momentum/price change: it’s rising but not topping at the moment
* Higher div yield than peers; in line with SPY
* 3 year smoothed FCF yield is 11.5% > WACC: good value looking at a longer time horizon
* P/B lower than peers with better fundamental improvement compared to peers

**What now**

* Long $LYTS with a PT of 12.5; EV/FCF based at 16x T12 FCF
* Write July calls at 12.50, IV = 48% on the bid

**What are you not telling me**

* Pretty low volume: 90 day average = 106k
* New management in the last 3 years might not have navigated the company through a full market cycle
* A slow down in infrastructure spending would negatively impact their profitability

*Data from company website, Refinitiv, and Yahoo! Finance*",

m477a4,,investing,post,1615645263,"MeaTech, first publicly traded cultivated meat company, just launched $25 Million IPOFigured this was worth posting for anyone interested in the future of traditional meat alternatives:

[MeaTech Announces $25 Million US Initial Public Offering & Approval For Nasdaq Listing](https://vegconomist.com/trade/meatech-announces-25-million-us-initial-public-offering-approval-for-nasdaq-listing/)

First publicly traded company in this sector, they're using 3D printing technology to create high-end cultured meats such as steak. They create their own cells and meat tissue for this process. In December they acquired Piece of Meat, a cultured fat technology company, and said their first product could be on the market as early as 2022.

I see huge growth in this sector over the next few years. We've all heard about lab grown meat, usually in jest from news stories making light of it. But as years pass it's becoming increasingly clear that this is going to be a real and expansive market. Reports about the environmental urgency created by animal agriculture continue to pile up, and plant-based options have exploded in popularity over the past few years as well - but are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Products like this will be key in filling that gap and transitioning our food system away from current conventional models, by providing options to those not interested in plant-based alternatives. Cultivating meat also opens up a massive door in the future to addressing food scarcity issues.

MeaTech however launched to very little fanfare. Here's some info [ripped from Seeking Alpha:](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3672241-lab-grown-meat-company-meatech-3d-to-open-on-nasdaq-after-mixed-ipo#comments)

* Lab-grown meat firm MeaTech 3D (MITC) sank as much as 23.8% in its first trading day following a U.S. IPO as investors found the Israeli start-up’s stock less than appetizing.
* MeaTech fell to as low as $7.85 in early Nasdaq trading, way down from its $10.30 initial public offering. Shares beefed up some later in the session, but closed at $10 a share, down 2.9% lower on the day.
* MeaTech had a mixed IPO that saw it sell more American Depositary Shares than expected, but at a weak $10.30-a-share price.
* On one hand, the company sold 2.4M ADSs, well above the 1.7M that it originally offered. However, the company had originally expected to sell shares at $15.10 apiece.
* Still, the combination of more shares at a lower price meant the IPO raised about $25M, which was MeaTech’s original target.
* The firm also granted underwriters the option to buy 364,000 additional ADSs for overallotments.
* Each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares in the company, which already trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker “MEAT” and U.S. OTC market as “MTTCF.”
* MEAT fell 5.8% in Tel Aviv on Thursday ahead of the U.S. IPO, while MTTCF lost 17.2% Friday to close at $1.20. That took the company’s market cap down to about $97.2M.
* MeaTech is developing three-dimensional printers and the biotechnology and manufacturing processes needed to assemble lab-grown proteins into meat “without the need for animal slaughter,” as per its S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
* The company also wrote in the filing that unlike rivals who are trying to develop “unstructured” lab-grown meat products like sausages, MeaTech aims to create “high-margin, high-value structured and cultured meat products such as steak.”

And here's a [bit of DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/greeninvestor/comments/m1yv2o/meatech_3d_ipo_will_this_3d_meat_printer_also/) from u/birdweiser2 as well:
>PROS

>First 3d meat printer (lab grown meat) listed on a major US exchange. The market likes cleantech, 3d printers, and stocks that are unique.

>The founder (Sharon Fima) worked for Nanodimension. Should be enough for Cathie Wood fanboys. It could maybe get added to ARKK - who knows - but people are gonna think it will.

>Bill Gates said rich companies shouldn't be eating meat. Gates is invested in Memphis Meats which does something really similar to what MeaTech does, but isn’t a public company. Memphis raised in 2019 which put the valuation at 2 billion, then raised again a couple months ago, but none of the articles I saw gave a valuation on that raise. Can anyone shine some light on that?

>CONS

>This company has no revenue and says it won’t for a while. So it’s basically a SPAC lol, but at a fraction of the price since they’re mostly all a billion and higher.

>There’s a lot of competitors in this space, but again this is the first to list and it’s at least 10x cheaper than the biggest competitor.

>Their meat products will be expensive when they do go on sale, but I think rich people will want them still. Kinda like how Tesla started - their cars were expensive for a long time, rich people bought them, it helped grow the company, and now they’re cheaper.


While this clearly won't see instant explosive growth like Beyond Meat did (an established brand that had been on the market for years), I entered a small position to keep an eye on this sector. Haven't seen anyone talking about it, so I'm interested to see what others think!","['TEL', 'GPS', 'TSLA', 'NDAQ', 'TGT', 'ARKK']"

m8q2t6,,StockMarket,post,1616185167,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dropped after China reportedly banned some state and military personnel from using the company's vehicles over national security concerns, according to reports from outlets including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.
* The [U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-to-restore-bank-capital-requirements-as-treasury-markets-130935328.html) that it will not extend a temporary bank leverage ratio exemption past its March 31 expiration date. Leverage ratio put simply, is a regulation that restricts how much money a bank can lend relative to how much capital the bank devotes to its own assets. The exemption that is expiring at the end of the month made lowered the leverage ratio to allow banks to lend out money more easily.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
> The bond market’s reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell’s briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
> “This is bonds’ — I wouldn’t call it day in the sun — it’s more like day in the tornado,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “Clearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that’s not the case.”
*****
> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “The bond move has been huge, and it’s starting to scare people,” said Schumacher.
*****
> “There’s been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?” he asked. “There’s no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It’s incredible.”
*****
> # Powell speaks
*****
> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
> # Inflation and the Fed
> There is also some key data.
*****
> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank’s forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year’s numbers when prices fell.
*****
> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It’s a change to the Fed’s ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
> “For the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there’s a consensus problem. There can’t not be tension,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> “They will be trying to clarify the Fed’s message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,” she said. “They will be explaining themselves as economists, and they’ll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.”
*****
> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
> “The market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed’s dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,” said Grohowski.
*****
> “Yet, they’re committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,” he said. “That’s what the market is struggling with. I think it’s unsettling to me to hear words like ‘overshoot.’”
*****
> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‘great rotation’ from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
> “I think we’re in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It’s not over, but I think we’ve seen the lion’s share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,” said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed’s willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike’s comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
> “Inflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,” Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year’s earnings.”
*****
> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed’s economic forecast.
*****
> “If you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It’s too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,” Grohowski said.
*****
> # Bond market direction
> Schumacher said there’s a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

> # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One
*****
> “The stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.” Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard
*****
> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick’s Day! We’ve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here’s to some more today and over the rest of 2021.
*****
> One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ’29 crash, the ’87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn’t do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we’ve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we’ll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
> So what happens now is the logical question? “The good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although it won’t be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls’ side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.”
*****
> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
> “Global growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators” according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “When we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.”
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “The level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country’s below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country’s relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January’s 0.5% pace.
*****
> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI’s value.
*****
> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite’s growth, while manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-picture-3.19.21.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> “In recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.”
*****
> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

m92ura,,StockMarket,post,1616229188,"3rd try to post my Part II MOMO Inc. Analysis Update**Sentiment and Ratings**

Another parallel between MOMO and GME I see is the negative sentiment. Like GME being a cyclical stock, with a multi-year downturn and a multi-year shitstorm, MOMO has had almost 2 full years of bad news. So the sentiment is of course at the bottom and there are catalysts needed to re-price the stock towards the upside potential. The good thing is, the downside is limited due to solid fundamentals.

Also rating agencies add their 2 cents on the stock here and there. The latest downgrade came from Morgan Stanley. Well, those ""experts"" increased their position by 42% at the end of last year and now talk about a price traget of $15:

[NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/c0rn2bbl85o61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=770e0d0be1bdd32342d6b1fb9b3149aa730e6436)

So I don't know what they intend or if their price target follows any agenda, but I think their price target is not right. Their arguments are:

* weaker than expected recovery after the strategic reform and outlook in 2021, potential regulatory risk, and recent rebound in valuation;
* we see a weak 2021 outlook;
* higher revenue sharing ratios for the new contractual incentive programs for golden broadcasters, and some VAS use cases.

Well then why the heck do you load up shares massively in the first place. And these are basically abstract, universal bullshit risks that every company has to face. Like me saying, I wouldn't buy Amazon stock because anti monopoly regulations could split the company, logistic comapnies have raised their prices and Covid will leave people unemployed and broke and nobody buys anything. Universal risks, not false.

On the other hand, they price $BMBL in at $56 implying a $6.5bn valuation, which in my opinion is madness regarding a revenue of not even $500m compared to $MOMO of $2.3bn, basically saying that the company is worth only $3bn.

[FINVIZ](https://preview.redd.it/quesq4jr85o61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=1204e91701714572058c92208d01ca5cf0818e85)

The guy from Morgan Stanley seems to be a Chinese dude at the company and he gave the price target. If you want to know how young Chinese guys value the apps, look at the video Nian Li posted about MOMO on YouTube!

As I said in my previous article, I assume a fair value of the stock of $25-$40. Let me try to test that statement based on additional facts.

**Balance Sheet**

Let's look at the balance sheet as well, this one I did not cover last time. The company has virtually $1.7bn on hands, and (as far as I am concerned) Tantan is on the books for price/goodwill of $735m. Other Long term assets are there with another $705m. All in all you have $3.3bn in assets that are basically cash or can be sold.

Total debt/liabilities of the company is $1.25bn, leaving the equity position at $2.1bn.

If you value a company like this at 1.6 x Equity (current market cap of $3.5bn), you definitely leave out massive potential of the calculation.

Let's say you take over the company, what would you pay for, what would you deduct if you owned the company? I would see:

* Cash on hands
* Assets (Tantan and Momo users)
* Liabilities

Cash on hands is cash on hands is cash on hands: $1.7bn

I would still value each user between $10-$15 bucks: $4.7-$7.1bn

Liabilities is liabilities: $1.25bn

This leaves me at $5.15-7.55bn for 100% of the shares thereabouts, if I could buy and liquidate the company. The leaves me at $25-$37 a share, so I guess the more refined approach makes my first estimate looks pretty damn solid. And it's not going to get more complicated than that!!

Here I am not talking about subjective discounts or premiums on country or political risks, but merely numbers I can cross examine and that make sense to me.

**Other risks**

If you think China is a bad country and the companies and the party there are bad and fraudulent, okay, you can price that in. But to me $MOMO is too simple a company and why would they make up anything.

1. Founder is still heavily invested.
2. The company is pretty conservative and cash producing.
3. Their earnings calls sound true to me.

The company sees that MOMO App has matured and accepts that as fact. So the revenue plateau here is recognized as such and they try to apply new functions there, by saving cash and reinvest.

In the Q3 earnings call they are very open about the fact that MOMO has matured, they have plenty of cash, they are ""prudent"" in M&A activities, etc. What I mean is, those guys seem to be relaxed and in no hurry. If you make shit up, you try to always beat the numbers and try to smokebomb everyone and doing shady shit behind the screen.

They are crysrtal clear also about the fact that Q4 might still be subject to restructuring, optimizing, weak growth, etc. They sound sincere and act like business owners, like ""we need to chill out, save our cash and see how we can grow again from here."" Unlike overpaid coke-nosed-boomer CEOs they take a break and see. Long-term oriented. And of course they want to make money, why do you think they started the whole thing years ago!! Speaking of which...

**Valuation 5 years ago**

Read this article from JUNE 23, 2015 : [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-momo-inc-m-a-yan-tang/chinese-chat-app-momo-gets-buyout-offer-from-ceo-idUSKBN0P31K920150623?edition-redirect=in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-momo-inc-m-a-yan-tang/chinese-chat-app-momo-gets-buyout-offer-from-ceo-idUSKBN0P31K920150623?edition-redirect=in)

""\[bla bla bla\] The offer values the company at $3.6 billion.""

That was 2015!!! MOMO anounced its purchase of Tantan on FEB 23, 2018: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/china-s-momo-to-acquire-smaller-tinder-like-rival-app-tantan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/china-s-momo-to-acquire-smaller-tinder-like-rival-app-tantan)

Tantan was valued at $735m in 2018 and is still on the books at that price. Value that asset with todays prices. Tantan in 2018 had 95m active users. Bumble? Let's see:

[BUSINESSOFAPPS](https://preview.redd.it/ceg3lo1e95o61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c49ceafc954d29a3bba2d466dd5714c206906f7)

So either is Bumble only worth $735m like Tantan or Tantan is worth $7.6bn like bumble. Or it's somewhere in the middle and I am right.

**Conclusion**

So anyway. I still think

* MOMO is significantly undervalued,
* Morgan Stanley should pay me money for doing their homework,
* BUMBLE is a hype stock!

Have a nice weekend everybody!!

When people post their pump BS ""technical analysis,"" remember that it is BS. Don't believe people. If they mention a ticker, assume they're biased and wrong. That includes  professionals. If you really want to listen to somebody, pay for a well-regarded subscription service.

The videos that are useful are ones that teach how to do technical analysis. And understanding that it is a bit of an art form; there is a lot of subjectivity, and you have to make judgements based on experience. The automated systems for it are not high quality.

Fundamental analysis has to be done in context of the stock price, so you really need to understand the chart; especially volume. Maybe the fundamentals were good last time they filed paperwork, but maybe they've changed recently and there was some sort of news. You have to be able to see that. So you want to be able to at least look at a chart and tell at a glance if it went down on high volume, or down on low volume, and to understand the difference in implications. Same for going up on high or low volume. And going down on high volume, followed by going up on low volume, vs all the other combinations.

Does a smart investor move money she makes into a money market account and wait for dips to buy?

Now for the main question. When to sell. IMO, you sell when the stock hits a price you don't think it will surpass for a long long time, the company is at risk of going bankrupt and/or they need liquid assets. Otherwise if you did your job right you probably won't need to sell and you can sit back and enjoy dividends and/or stock buy backs.",

Also never invest with money you are scared to lose. You can be up a lot of money and then be in the negative just as much it’s a very fun adventure if you are not afraid to possibly lose it all. But it can be a very lucrative investment!!!",
m8rzhi,grj5o32,StockMarket,comment,1616193143,"Yes, a smart investor keeps cash around for buying opportunities.

However, if she keeps it in actual-cash, or money market, that's a small difference, and opinions vary. Fidelity automatically keeps your ""core position"" in a money market account, so when you sell something you don't have to move it there at all. That does usually earn some extra money.

Personally, I opt out of that and keep my core position in real cash, because I have no idea what the currency markets might be doing in a crash or something, and I don't want another source of volatility. Also, I'm hedged heavily in a VIX index, which will go up if the market crashes, so that means I keep a lot less in cash than would if I didn't have that hedge. Because of this, I often end up with all my money in play while waiting for my swing trades to mature. But if the market crashes, I'll sell the VIX and buy what is down.

When it comes to selling... probably 80% of the times that I wondered, ""this is up, should I sell it?"" and didn't, I should have. Confirmation bias and FOMO are evil emotions that you have to combat. Wanting it to go up more ends up taking a longer time, and I make the most money of quick turnarounds at 5-10%. Trying to find the peak is usually a bad idea; and if you sell and then it goes up more, you need to stay focused on the big picture; you didn't know when that peak would be this time, or the other time, or the next time, so don't feel like you made a mistake. Selling at a profit you were comfortable taking is never a mistake.👼",

m90qqh,,StockMarket,post,1616219390,"Robinhood help!!Okay so I am really REALLY new to stocks. The only experience I have is in middle school there was a simulator website that was based on the actual stock market prices at that moment. The only thing was it didn't implement that the stock market opened and closed.

So I bought $1.00 in Hershey today while the stock market was closed and the line was flat. My less than one stock is still in queue (I pourpously am only using small sums of money I know I won't get much back in return if it sky rockets but I don't know that much so I would rather play it a bit safe)

My question is will my share be when the market opens or when I bought it during the flat line?",
m90qqh,grkdnz6,StockMarket,comment,1616220345,"I'm not sure what you mean, but this is what happens as far as I understand.

You put in a market order. Your brokerage (robinhood) will execute that order when market opens. The stock can be traded over the weekend but after hours trades affect the price of the stock more than during market hours due to reduced liquidity during those times. 

When the market opens the price jump as lots of orders are placed for the opening bell. Your broker will execute your trade as best as they can, which means at the best price they can get you as quickly as they can at market open. If you are buying a dollars worth of shares, you will be getting a fraction of a share, which probably means you will get the highest fraction RH can get you at that set price.

I always buy whole shares so not sure about that one",

But choose LOVE in these tough times to you fellow redditors.Hey Reddit - can we all just step back for a second and appreciate how good things really are?  I think a lot of our reddit threads need some love and positivity, versus just memes and negative pressured news.

To that end, **I'm sending some good vibes, love, and true positivity your way on a Friday**. This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

To the entire stock market community - please know you're not alone. **Life is beautiful in so many ways, all you need to do is find the right places to look. Your loved ones, your family, and those in your circle love the positive you** \- so let's work together to foster a community beyond memes and tendies, but honest and open truth about how we're feeling.

**If anyone needs to chat - PLEASE MESSAGE ME.**  I'm here for you.  Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.",['ARKK']

Good morning Traders, Expiration day big move in store for today... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... [Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 3 19 21](https://youtu.be/YbIiDsZ7qKQ)

📷

Big move instore for today. Keys to today... first is expected move, which on the high end is 401.16 and low end is 386.96. More than not lately we have tagged one end of the expected move. Next is bonds and rates, will they back off enough to get a pop/rebound today. Bonds need to stay above 153’3, rates back off awhile not pushing sharply up thru 17.55. Third are internals: gaps or extreme opening prints will mean a pause for the moment in current downtrend but will be temporary. Forth and probably most important is understanding day structure and identifying that as early as possible. The different day structures are as follows; range day, trend day up, trend day down, and rounded reversal which I like to call trange day. Now the 3 outcomes to prepare for today are 1) we hold support at 388 area with a pause in rate and bond drama we get a pop today toward 393 area. The 393 area will hold another decision.2) we open with a gap down on both the spy and internals we try to retest yesterdays close of 391.41 and fail giving us a down trend day Hold on its going to be a long ride down.3) we consolidate between 391 and 388 areas before breaking higher or lower.

1. we hold support at 388 area with a pause in rate and bond drama we get a pop today toward 393 area. The 393 area will hold another decision. **40% probability**
2. we open with a gap down on both the spy and internals we try to retest yesterdays close of 391.41 and fail giving us a down trend day Hold on its going to be a long ride down. **50% probability**
3. we consolidate between 391 and 388 areas before breaking higher or lower. **10% probability**

Unless we get very extreme openings on internals, I will wait the first 20 to 30 min to identify day structure first before making any additional moves",['GPS']

It’s never really to late if you plan on a long term investment.

You always want to make sure that what you are putting your money towards is something that has a foreseeable future, or something that you believe has the potential to be something someday. Every coin, crypto, token, etc... has some sort of overall goal or game plan. Make sure that it is reputable. And MOST IMPORTANT....

I have a few questions for someone that is brand new to the stock market. I appreciate any and all of you that take time out of your busy and hopefully lucrative day to answer some of these questions.
 
First, I would just like to casually trade on my own without the help of a stock broker. Like, I want to look at a stock, click purchase, enter the amount I would like to purchase, then click submit, and now I own that amount of stock. Same with selling. I understand there may be fees involved at different levels and I am fine with that, but for the time being I don't want to have to tell a stock broker to purchase or sell for me. What is the best (and cheapest) platform for this?
 
Second, what are puts and calls? How do they differ from just buying the stock itself?
 
Next, I am sure someone has broached this subject before, but after the gamestop thing occurred why not get everybody on this sub (or others as well) together and agree to purchase another stock jointly? Like, a stock worth $50 or less per share and cause it to increase, just like with gamestop? Is it not easier and quicker to get a stock to go from say $5 to $100, than it is to get a stock to go from $100 to $150? And then just keep doing this after that new stock hits a pre-determined number. Like once it hits $100 or $150 per share, then a large portion of people get out and move on to the next stock.",

Impossible. Your broker is how your order gets sent to the market maker/exchange for execution, or gets filled in house. 

>Second, what are puts and calls? How do they differ from just buying the stock itself?

Puts and calls are derivatives, meaning they derive their value from the price of the underlying stock. 

They differ because they give you the right to either buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of the underlying. 

>Next, I am sure someone has broached this subject before, but after the gamestop thing occurred why not get everybody on this sub (or others as well) together and agree to purchase another stock jointly?

This is also not legal....

why do bond yields matter? because the 10-year treasury is now more profitable than the S&P 500 overall dividend yield. this metric means that since april 2020 there was no alternative to investing money except in stocks or staying in cash - now there is an alternative in the fixed income market (even though these pathetically low interest rates still won't keep up with inflation). this is creating large fund changes and reallocations to begin. the most noticable effect is long term risky equities will be dumped first (why? their future earnings / profits are getting cut due to potentially higher costs of borrowing and inflation), and recovery play stocks will be held or pushed higher.",['SPGI']

m8q1t2,,StockMarket,post,1616185092,"Why you should invest in SPACs and what exactly they are. Remember to always do your own DD. It seems like every month there’s a new investing trend taking the investing world by storm— short squeezing, NFTs, and now, SPACs.

SPACs, aka special purpose acquisition companies, have seen a huge increase in popularity just over the last year. In fact, in 2020, there were 237 SPAC IPOs that raised US$79.87 billion, compared to US$13.6 billion raised in the previous year from only 59 IPOs.

So what is a SPAC (pronounced spack), and how should you get on board with the booming investing trend? Let’s break this down.

What’s so special about a SPAC?

Even if you’re brand new to investing, it’s likely you’re familiar with the term IPO. An Initial Public Offering is when a company finally goes public and has its shares of equity available for purchase by—you guessed it—the public. The shares are bought for an exchange in capital in order for the company to raise money.

SPACs have been disrupting the world of IPOs, because in a nutshell, they provide a faster way forward for companies to sell their shares to the public without all the red tape than an IPO involves. But SPACs are attractive to privately-held companies for numerous reasons. 

Simply put, a SPAC is a publicly-traded shell that is made for the sole purpose of merging with a privately held business. And they’re not new, either. SPACs have been around for decades, they just have a bit of a sketchy past, with a reputation for misleading investors into buying into shady companies. Since then, however, the SEC has been regulating SPACs to reduce fraud, and SPACs have been surging big time.

So, what’s all the buzz about? Are SPACs a worthwhile investment? And how exactly does it all work? Let’s take a look: [https://marketbuzz.ca/what-are-spacs-why-are-they-trending](https://marketbuzz.ca/what-are-spacs-why-are-they-trending/)",

If you don't understand SPACs a lot better than this nonsense above, don't even touch them. They're pure speculation, and there are too many of them so many will fail badly.

If you do buy a SPAC, don't buy it if it is over $11; their baseline price is usually $10, and that's what the back-room negotiations for their merger will be based on, so buying a SPAC even at $12 you're most likely throwing your money away.

Marginally better than lottery tickets. Yes, I own a few SPACs. But I'm a speculative swing trader who enjoys volatility. They're not something that is making me a lot of money, that's for sure. Bio/med-tech is a much more reliable speculation machine.👩‍🎓👼",['BIO']

m80b80,,StockMarket,post,1616100430,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021 

Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks.  Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

As of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control.

Her vision for this stock might not make sense to some people and I can understand why. They aren't making profits and if you consider their financials, their stock shouldn't even be valued at where it is now. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, came on CNBC and blatantly stated that if you are not in this company for the long run, it is not for you. I fully agree. You have to have vision when it comes to stocks like this, you have to understand it's potential. And jeez, Palantir has soo much potential for growth.

Palantir is a software company that deals with data. Data will be very important in the future; It will do so many things for companies and it's software is ahead of it's time. 17 years in the making. 17 fucking years in the making, endless amounts of funding by the government to make this technology happen. It really has no competitors that come close to what they are doing. It has happened. They are pushing their technology to the commercial market, they have already signed so many deals and made so many partnerships with BIG companies and government contracts. A lot of clients are actually INVESTING in the company. That speaks for it self. What I find interesting is that Palantir actually has no marketing team... crazy to think about, but it just reassures my conviction in this company. It is just the beginning for Palantir.

Palantir will lead many frontiers in the coming and near future, AI for one. AI is expected to reach 733.6 billion by 2027. If it leads in markets such as AI, imagine the growth Palantir will have. I believe it is going to be one of the few companies that will reach a 1 trillion valuation.

People really haven't realized what this company is doing, and once they do, liftoff ladies and gentlemen, buckle up.

Allied Energy Corporations (AGYP) is making rapid growth over the last 2 months, rising as much as 500%, which led them to make a huge move by hiring an extremely well-known member of the oil community, Curtis William Boyles. to execute their potential lead in the best way possible. It is known that when the oil prices rise, many companies will be looking to invest into expanding their oil production capacity, which will be affordable with the profit they will be making from the rise.

After AGYP rapid growth they decided to make a different kind of investment, to hire Curtis William Boyles, A man with more than 30+ years of experience that is highly respected within the oil sector as an Oil and Gas operations manager and consultant. He will be in looking after all necessary operations, drillings, and water well injection permits. Mr. Boyles will also the judge all potential acquisitions and joint-venture endeavors.

On top of that, AGYP will be rely on Mr. Boyles to manage all planning and operations of property evaluation projects to determine investment potential, development, exploratory findings, Manage infrastructure and property purchases.

On 4 march of 2021 AGYP has signed an agreement with a premier partner in the Texas oil industry to gain majority ownership of two producing oil wells in northern Texas. The company will be having 100% working interest and 80% Net Revenue interest ownership. By looking at Mr. Boyles overall reputation and expertise, it is safe to assume that these 2 wells with AGYP’s growth and huge future potential are in reliable hands.

I started investing/trading just a few months ago and the mental turmoil is a lot more that I expected, to be completely honest. Losing money in stocks you thought would take off just for them to go red and drain your account is very disheartening. I’ve seen a lot of tickets go up double digits, even triple, in percentage and have given in to FOMO more than I’d like to admit. Nothing is worse than seeing massive gains turn into massive loss. I’ve thought about giving up so many times. I’ll say it right now, I’ve been super disappointed in myself even if I’ve only lost a net few hundred dollars. In a crazy market like this, how are new investors supposed to keep up in this environment? 

This seems like a rant and doesn’t really fit here in an informative way, but it’s easy to dismiss the emotional and mental strength you need to participate in the market. To fellow new investors: you guys aren’t the only ones losing and you are not alone. Take a step back and analyze what you’re doing wrong and learn from your mistakes. Revaluate if you can handle the market and be real with yourself. Personally, I’m taking a break to get away from all of this. It has been eating me up everyday looking at my account and trying to catch tickers that aren’t going to absolutely wreck my account. For one, I need to work on patience and not expect instant gains/free money. If anyone can relate to my experiences, I hope this helps you out in any way and give you motivation to not give up.

From my understanding, the 10 year is the prime benchmark that measures investor sentiment across financial markets. If bond prices are down yields go up, that signals that investors feel they can make a higher return elsewhere ( i.e. confidence in the markets) if bond prices are higher and yields are trending downwards it would suggest the opposite. 

My question is this: why did a hike in the 10 year yield spook the market into a sell off today? Rising yield rates indicate that investor confidence in the market is high, right? So wouldn’t we only need to be concerned with lower yield rates? (i.e. low confidence in the market; investors feel that their money is better off in bonds rather than the stock market)",

If not, here’s the written DD version:

USEI is a CBD, Green Energy and Cryptocurrency stock. I’m really excited and bullish on this stock since it has multiple things going for it. #1 they have assets worth way more than the stock price is trading at currently, #2 they are about to go pink current which is a huge catalyst, they’ve already filed their financials, now they just need to file the attorney letter, and #3 there are some possible catalysts coming which would be the revealing of 2 companies that they own.


https://usenergyinitiatives.com/

As we can see on their website, they’re focused on MJ, green energy and currencies as it goes forth in the coming years. 

Now, their new plan is what I’m really excited for and I’m sure this will really be the gamechanger for this company. They pivoted from being a primarily MJ focused business, but now they’re looking to focus on Green Energy and Crypto mining. 

Now, the last sentence is what’s really important here. They’re talking about how they have a significant amount of assets in certain currencies that they’ll use to grow their company in the future. 

I’ll talk about those assets in a second, but first, I did want to talk about their industries section, so the first one is Green Energy which they say they’ll be using wind and solar energy to help power their crypto currency operation. This basically means they’re able to provide electricity to their crypto miners for a very low cost, which is honestly pretty unique, having low margins when mining crypto is super important. One NASDAQ stock I’m invested in is CLSK, and they have micro grids that allow them to mine bitcoins at a 90% margin which is insanely high. I don’t know what margins USEI has for their mining operation, but I do like the fact that they’re using these resources to get their costs lower.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/05/1644764/0/en/USEI-Takes-Ownership-of-5-1-M-Sumcoin.html

So like I mentioned earlier, they said they have a significant amount of assets in certain currencies that they’ll use to grow their company in the future. So we see here they announced their ownership of 52.7k Sumcoins in exchange for 3.6million USEI shares. The value of SUMCOIN that they had acquired at the time was worth $5.1 million.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/USEI/profile


Right now, SUMCOIN is trading at $810, let’s use $800 for our calculations, but their SUMCOIN is now worth about 42 million dollars, when the market cap of the company itself is only 26 million dollars. So this stock is super cheap right now, in my opinion.

https://sec.report/otc/financial-report/274349

Now, I know you guys are probably wondering if they still have those coins. There’s another company out there named Coin Citadel, ticker symbol CCTL that’s been leading on its investors whether they still hold Bitcoin from several years ago, but this company on the other hand has their financials updated. This is their balance sheet for the calendar year of 2020, and we can see they have their SUMCOINs as an asset with a value of 5.1 million dollars. Now, that 5.1 million dollars figure is a bit confusing, if we scroll down in the balance sheet, we see that in 2016 they made the transaction to acquire those currencies and were valued at about 5 cents per share and at the time of writing the document they are trading over $400 per coin. NOtE: the overall value of this currency is continually noted at this $5 million evaluation value and will continually be priced at this value until it is sold.

Now, it’s confusing since they said it was worth 5 million dollars when the coin was trading at 5 cents per coin, but in the PR earlier, they said they acquired 52.7k, so I’m just going to assume the value 52.7k is correct.

https://twitter.com/USEnergyInit

So on their twitter, they’ve been talking about how they just filed the first of 5 OTC Market Reports and are in the process to getting back to pink current.

https://sec.report/Ticker/USEI

Now on the SEC filings, we can see that they have 3 quarterly reports and 1 annual report for 2020, meaning all their financials are up to date, and I believe we only need to wait for their attorney letter with respect to current information, which could come any day and is a huge catalyst, so I think that you guys should hop on this stock ASAP, but this is not financial advice.

Now if we go  on their twitter, there’s 2 interviews with the CEO, feel free to listen to them for yourself, there’s alot of insight that he gives, but I’ll try to give you guys some of the highlights of them. So in the Feb 21 interview, the CEO confirmed they have a significant holding of crypto still which is SUMCOIN, there’s a high possibility of a share buyback, there were some issues that USEI had over the past few years that have all been resolved, and there’s potentially another company that could be working with USEI. He also said that he’s really confident that USEI will do really well this year and there’s nothing stopping them, they said that they do not need any more financing. 

In the February 14 interview, he again confirmed they have their SUMCOINS, and the CEO talked about how they’ll be planning to coordinate with multiple companies and they actually own 2 companies in the crypto space, and possibly a 3rd one soon.

So as a recap of everything, CEO is super confident in the company, the company just changed their plans and is focusing on the Green Energy and Crypto mining industry recently, they have 52.7k SUMCOINS which is worth about $42 million, and they’re getting pink current very very soon. In my opinion, these are all very bullish signs and I personally will be buying this stock, but do your own research, anyways that’s going to be it for today’s DD if you guys liked it and want to hear more research on OTC stocks, feel free to subscribe to my youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHXRDSK_npOQYM0bjcLFhOQ , I’ll catch you guys in the next one, peace out.","['TWTR', 'NDAQ']"

m84dyk,,StockMarket,post,1616111970,"Interesting Ford Motors US$2B Convertible Note 

Ford Motors stock is getting beaten up this week. The stock closed last Friday (3/12/21) at US$13.36. The stock closed today at about US$12.49. I think that slide will end tomorrow (3/19/21). Ford Motors has 4B, more or less, common shares outstanding, partly owned (52% +/-) by about 1,300 institutional investors. Early this week Ford Motors announced a Private Placement Debt Convertible zero coupon Note offering for US$2B. The offering was priced about Wednesday and offered to its qualified institutional investors. The terms of the offering was for every US$1,000 Note, there would be zero interest paid, and it would be a five year convertible Note, all due March 15, 2016. The conversion rate is set at 57.1886 shares per US$1,000 principal amount of the Note, implying a conversion price of about US$17.49 per share. The Company expects to receive the funds from the offering tomorrow. The funds are being partly used to further develop the Company's future technology with regard to electric vehicles. Ford Motor Company is reinventing itself from a old-line automobile manufacturing company to a automotive electric technology company and self-driving transportation company. As the Company transforms itself, the stock will be re-priced.

So the stock has been beaten up. Is this convertible note a good deal for the Company, or not? Looking at it from the Company's point-of-view, as the CFO, another way to look at it is that the Company sold a Five-year Leap Option for $1,000 premium to the Buyer to purchase 57.1886 shares at $17.49 per share to be exercised before March 15, 2026, with the ""string"" that the Company would pay the US$1,000 back, without any interest, if the Note holder does not exercise the conversion privilege. If any dividend is declared to the common stock, these convertible Notes are not included in the dividend. So, the Company has the US$1,000 to work with now, and for the next five years, and maybe pay the principal back, without interest, or issue 57.1886 shares.

On the other side, the institutional investor has to make a few decisions: what is the expected rate of return on invested capital? At what price does the institution expect Ford common stock to be selling in five years. If the institution expects a seven percent return on this type of investment it would have to earn US$70.00 per year. Then, the stock would have to sell for more than US$17.49 plus $6.12 = US$23.61. ($70.00 X 5 years = $350 divided by 57.1886 = US$6.12 ). (These are, of course, back-of-the-envelope numbers, and there are other considerations, in addition to not receiving any recurring interest or return on investment, effects of inflation, and the institution turns the US$1,000 from a liquid asset to a non-liquid asset and the opportunity costs to invest the same money somewhere else at a higher return).

Looking at it from the point-of-view of a shareholder, the above rough number of US$23.61 is about twice what the stock is selling for today. If the stock doubled in value in five years, that would be a 14.4% per cent return per year. I personally think Ford will do much better than that over the next five years. I personally think Ford will double in 18-24 months. Lots going on with Ford, and a lot of new models, including the electric Ford-150, Bronco and Mustang.

This is how I see it with the information I have, what do you think? . . . I could be wrong . . . .",

A few share buy backs, increased dividends, and further adding cash to their books and I could see it reaching $30 a share within 5yrs easy. 

People forget that the stocks that do the best during market turmoil and bear markets are the ones with the most cash on the books, and lets face it in 30yrs you won't be able to buy a gas or diesel vehicle without special ordering it and paying environmental taxes through the teeth.

# Summary

* With increasing demand for Lithium I wanted to find a Lithium producer that has strong reserves and upside in the medium to long term
* LAC has the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America and the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* These two assets are under development but are nearing completion. Price dipped recently but based on their existing assets and recent analyst price targets LAC seems like a decent investment

# Lithium Background

I wanted to understand how Lithium is extracted to make sure I could gauge the viability of the lithium mining companies I was looking at. I summarized my findings below if you are curious. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022. [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/lithium-production-2340123#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20extract%20lithium,increasingly%20high%20concentrations%20of%20lithium.)

Tpa = Tonnes Per Annum – essentially how much Lithium they can extract on a yearly basis

# Market Overview

To summarize – Lithium demand is expected to grow exponentially. 2 main factors:

1. Falling Lithium prices over the last 3 years reduce investment in Lithium production globally

2. Surging demand for EVs and shift to green energy

**Lithium prices continue to soar – up 88% in 2021** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/lithium-prices-continue-to-soar-up-88-in-2021/)

**Schlumberger unit to launch Nevada lithium plant as EV demand rises** [**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-schlumberger-energy-plans-lithium-134649877.html)

If you haven’t heard of Schlumberger check them out, they are the world’s largest oilfield service company. If they are shifting into the lithium production space then the leadership team sees value and growth here. Also from the article “Demand for battery-grade lithium is projected to grow exponentially, driven by growth in the electric vehicle market, and efficient production of the metal has become an important topic for regions, industries, and technology companies.”

**Battery grade lithium prices in China surge 68%** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/battery-grade-lithium-prices-in-china-surge-68/)

While lithium’s majors are beginning to reengage in expansion plans, three years of falling lithium prices have failed to incentivize sufficient investment into the supply chain, leading to greater risks of price volatility as battery demand ramps up.

The prices here are in yuan/tonne so if we use a conversion rate of 1 yuan = $0.15 USD. Assume price is around 80,000 yuan/tonne then it is about $12,000 USD/tonne

# Lithium Americas

Leadership is one of the key aspects I look at when considering an investment. Most of their leadership team has 20+ years in lithium or resource production. They have a CTO who has 1-\_ year of lithium processing experience and used to work for Tesla. Check out their investor [presentation](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf) for a bit of background, but essentially from what I’ve seen they have a strong management team.

2 Main sites under development for Lithium

**Caucharí-Olaroz, Argentina (Brine Extraction)**

* Caucharí-Olaroz is the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America
* Partnered with Ganfeng Lithium on the jointly owned operation in Jujuy, Argentina
* Average production 40,000 tpa battery-grade Li2CO3
* After-Tax NPV10% is  $1.5 billion
* Quick math: 40,000 tpa x $12,000 USD/tonne = $480M USD annually
* Note: Production doesn’t start until 2022
* Capital expenditures for the Project remain on budget with $477 million (84%) of the $565 million committed, including $388 million (69%) spent, as of December 31, 2020.

**THACKER PASS LITHIUM PROJECT (Clay Extraction)**

* Developing the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* 100% owned by Lithium Americas with offtake rights uncommitted
* On January 15, 2021, the US Bureau of Land Management issued the Record of Decision following completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process.
* All remaining state permits and water right transfers required to commence construction **are expected later this year.**
* Top ten biggest lithium mines in the world [here](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) **Thacker Pass Lithium Project is #2**

# Summary of March 2, 2021 Full Year and Q4 Report 

I highlighted some key points and provided commentary to their recent Annual report

* · As at December 31, 2020, the Company had $148 million in cash and cash equivalents ($518 million as at February 28, 2021).  **great position to be in, especially with heavy CAPEX projects, especially with amount that has been spend in Argentina**
* · On January 22, 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock and issued 18,181,818 common shares at a price of $22.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $400 million (approximately $377 million net proceeds). **This is big especially if you look at the current price**
* On November 30, 2020, Lithium Americas completed an at-the-market equity program (“ATM Program”) and issued a total of 9,266,587 common shares from treasury for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million ($97 million net proceeds). **Price was \~$10 a share at this point in time**

Link [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-reports-2020-full-122600429.html)

**Analyst Price Target (link** [**here**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lac/forecast)**)**

* High: $30.50
* Average: $21.42
* Low: $16.00

# Risks

* **Nevada Permits** – This is always an unknow, they expect to receive permits by mid to late 2021. The Biden administration has made it clear they want to secure supply of precious resources but this permitting is at the State Level so if there is an issue this could delay the project. 
* **Argentina and China Partnership**: Their Argentinian assets is a joint venture with a Chines Lithium producer. So far it seems like development of the site has gone smoothly but geopolitical issues could prove to be a risk

# TLDR

* Price of lithium is increasing due to increased demand and ramp down of production over last 3 years
* Current US administration is looking to support and secure supply chain of critical materials and production – LAC owns 100% of the largest known lithium resource in America
* Opportunity to buy the dip and hold medium to long term

No. It might do well long-term, and it might not, but it isn't going very far, because Lithium mining can't be scaled very quickly in response to demand the way copper and silver can.

They would have to acquire shares at the selling price from other holders. As more shares are purchased, the cost per share will increase since the other sellers see an opportunity. In the end, they would own shares with an average cost basis between the cheapest shares and most expensive.

This would drive the price up but for that stock to become more valuable someone would have to buy those shares back.

There are other factors at play but this would be the general gist. Depending on how many shares are available to purchase the situation would play out similar to a squeeze.

Edit: I forgot to add that if others did the same thing then they would be competing for shares at an increasing price.",

It would send it upwards. 

If someone bought $10B worth of company stock that was not already affiliated with the company, they'd have to file something with the Securities and Exchange Commission because they might be acquiring more than a 10% stake in the company.

m7uc61,,StockMarket,post,1616084088,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)MODS: I posted this in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and thought you all might be interested in the DD.

Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advice. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis.

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.","['IR', 'SPGI', 'NDAQ', 'TGT']"

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures hit by another jump in Treasury yields

> * Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures fell Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 14-month high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

> * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

*****

> # 2. Bond traders continue to battle the Fed on rates

> * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

*****

> # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

> * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

> * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

*****

> # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

> * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

*****

> # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

> * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

Growth is obviously helped by the fact that they are a supplier for Pfizer-Biontech mRNA covid vaccine. They have good margins and they expect to have EPS around 0.8-0.9 for 2021, so that's a P/E of 40-45 with phenomenal growth. It seems at minimum they should hit these values for 2021 and they should have plenty of room to grow in the future.

If it’ll likely appreciate dramatically (e.g. 10x) in a few months, due to wall street arrangements, then I’ll likely apply; otherwise, if it’ll behave just like an existing public stock that fluctuates normally, then I’ll likely not apply.

m7xrn4,grefwh8,StockMarket,comment,1616097199,Extremely unlikely. It’s way more likely that the price will drop to the 10.50 range. I think the SPAC bubble burst about two weeks ago.,
m7xrn4,grearny,StockMarket,comment,1616094737,"0.000001%

With an IPO or DPO, you don't really know what the market price is going to be.

With a SPAC, you already know it is priced at $10, and they do a back-room deal to effect the merger with a small premium, usually it ends up being $11-12. If it shoots up, it is generally on news, and moves before the news is public. And comes back down. There is also usually a private placement at around $12-14, so it is very unlikely to settle higher than that unless good news comes out right after the merger. And the company doesn't really want that; the good news happening before the merger helps their insiders a lot more, because they get a better value for the private placement.

SPACs are not get-rich-quick vehicles, they're backroom fake-IPOs. The only way it helps the retail trader is that we can speculate at $10-11, sell on the peak after the merger is announced, and be gone before it settles back down to $14. With an IPO, it starts high, and then settles downwards, so they usually suck for swing traders. Coupang is the ""Korean Amazon"" though, it is a special case with serious investment potential regardless where it settles in the short term. Roblox is more like a typical IPO/DPO; it was worth the $45 reference price, and there is no reason for it to sustain higher valuations without some sort of major news.👼",['AMZN']

Being that they are the largest manufacture of engines for the RAF (British Air Force), they are government backed so they are most likely here to stay. On top of that, Rolls-Royce is getting into electric planes and they are on track to create the fastest electric plane ever made. Not only that, but they are getting involved in the energy sector. They are looking to create solutions in energy consumption and efficiency. Analysts are estimating that within the next year, the price target is at the lowest estimate $2.18, Median is $4.38 and high is $6.25. To be honest, I’m fairly new to investing but I think that this is an opportunity. I am open to other ideas and a discussion, but I wanted to ask for your input! I have 3,000 shares and am already up 21% since I first purchased at $1.55 late February. I’m thinking of holding long term, but again, I want to know what you guys think!","['TGT', 'BA']"

Well it won't fucking happen if you're paying so much per delta that the option seller will have cash left over even after hedging.

You would be much more powerful if you bought shares instead of calls. The cheapest and most permanent way to increase the share price is to buy shares. Gamma squeezes are only possible when call premiums are too low to begin with. Also that hefty call premium you're paying goes to those betting against GME.

Just know that just like yourselves, I'm balls deep in the GME // AMC phenomenon, and the past two months have been the most interesting in all of my life.

Also, please note that I'm on a laptop, so I'll likely come back and edit this to make it look more enjoyable on a phone. Please forgive the lack of \[rocket emoji\]s! 

EDITED TO REMOVE POSITIONS

I've also been swinging option calls on the side, getting burned this week as I was hoping we'd get a push to 300.

**A BRIEF LOOK BACK**

So as we all know, GameStop took off in January. A lot went into it, and a hero was born. We know him as r/DeepF\*ckingValue, otherwise known as RoaringKitty on YouTube and Twitter. His ape name is Keith Gill, and was recently put in the hot seat at the recent Hearing regarding the trading halts that occurred in January, which ultimately prevented the squeeze from being squoze by eliminating a vast percentage of buying pressure. 

He likes the stock, but is not recommending that we buy it. He's recommending that we do our own DD, and dive into the rabbit hole of a crooked-fucked market ran by greed and manipulation that we've been watching day in, and day out for the past two months now, and the mess that they've created regarding short interest, failed to delivers, etc.

AMC happened to be in the mix during all this, and up to this point has survived as capable, and has saved AMC entirely. 

Both of these stocks have a great support system behind them, and that in and of itself is why we will not fail.

All we have to do is put up with the bullshit that is coming our way, and man, it's quite spectacular the lengths that these hedgefucks are willing to go to in order to try and shake us out of our positions.

ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING.

**WHERE ARE WE NOW?**

Here we fucking are, March of 2021, and GameStop is trading at $200/share after reaching a peak of $350 last week before the stoploss jerkfest of the century took place. 

AMC has been receiving great news as of late, and has had a lot of insider buying taking place that points to positive outlook moving forward. They now have 98% of theatres open, and the remaining will follow suit later this month.

Below is a list of positive reasons why we need to hold on to these two stocks until this event plays out, as I really believe that we're about to witness something that has never been seen before in the world of finance. 

Remember, apes, when in doubt, remember these things:

1. The hedgefunds are BLATANTLY manipulating the system in their favor using various methods such as naked shorting, short laddering, bid/ask spread manipulation, etc. Why would they be performing all of this fuckery? Because we have them by the balls. All we have to do is continue to buy and hold until they destroy themselves from the inside out.

2. A news article was released today stating that the Fed will no longer be providing ""Emergency Relief"" to big banks on Wal Street. Interesting timing, don't you think? A link to this article can be found here:  [Federal Reserve to End Emergency Capital Relief for Big Banks - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-end-emergency-capital-relief-for-big-banks-11616158811) 

3. We've determined Robinhood needs to be crucified, as all they've done is essentially take your money, data, and export it to a third party for insane amounts of cash, all while providing bogus shares to its' customers, and while causing the trading halt that prevented the squeeze in January. HOWEVER! Think of what this means. They fucked up big time. Not only did this action spark an investigation into their fuckery, but has also lead to two Hearings, with a third to follow. Not sure if anything will come of it, but the best part and silver lining is that ROBINHOOD IS NOW EXPOSED TO RETAIL TRADERS LIKE YOU AND I. They're the first domino in this corrupt witch-hunt to fall, and they won't be the last. Not only that, but now the squeeze will be even bigger than it could've been before, which will make for more tendies. :)

4. There has been a DTCC rule change that will go into effect at some point. If someone has some information on this that is VERIFIABLE, please share, as there seems to be no clear cut answer for when and if this rule has been taken into effect. In a nutshell, the rule change is allowing the DTCC to have daily calls to determine short positions, and the second part would allow the DTCC to forcibly liquidate any short positions that they feel would be too risky or abusive in nature. THIS IS HUGE. If it comes to fruition? We'll have to wait and see.

5. GME has an earnings report that is due next week. If they crush EPS, I strongly feel this could potentially be a catalyst going into next week. 

6. Bots and shills have been filling the comment sections trying to get us out of our positions. Why the fuck would they be doing this? Because again, they're desperate, and will do anything for your shares, because they know they'll be way more expensive as time progresses. Ignore these fucks. Block them, and move on with your day. If you read ANY NEGATIVE NEWS about GME or AMC via comments, always verify that they're at least not a bot/shill first. Let the hedgefunds waste their money there.

7. DFV IS STILL HOLDING. If he's still in it, we're still in it. Look to his tweets.

8. Both of these companies are doing great things for their business, shareholders, and future outlook. We should all be excited, and come together during this time and find support through each other. If we hold tight and ride this wave together, we cannot falter. 

We're living something spectacular right now, apes, and the progress we've made up to this point is simply astonishing given the forces that we're up against.

I'm here to ride this thing until the end, and I hope you all are too. Let's keep each other in the loop, and find ways to collaboratively take back from these greedy shits what has belonged to us since they first took it back in 2008.

To the hedgefunds? I hope you're scared. I hope you're nervous. I hope that you see the way of life you've so selfishly lived crumbling around you, as the average Joe takes back what is his, and with a burning vengeance. You can keep trying to cheat, steal, and manipulate your way to our shares, but the vast majority of our effort has become more resilient than you can tolerate.  If you read this, just know that you're fucked, and nobody is going to come running to save your ass this time. 

To all my fellow apes? Hold strong, warriors. That is what you truly are.

m8xqak,,wallstreetbets,post,1616208158,"GameStop.comOk so here’s some real fucking numbers for everyone. Hey Citadel/Melvin how you like these fucking Apples.

GameStop.com
4.15 million visitors/month over the past 6. 

That’s before all the mess they created and all the PR. I might add THEY paid for. Yes, even the FUD is free advertising. Remember there’s no such thing as BAD press. 
(The visitor rate is an actual number from the internet anyone can look it up) 

I ran an e-commerce site I know how this shit works and you’re sooooooooo fucked!!!!!

If you use normal website sale conversations it’s usually about 10% of visitors. So GameStop right now gets about 415,000 orders a month on their site and if you just say each one of them is JUST a game nothing else you’re looking at probably an avg sale of $60. So if we just say the site does this piddly little amount /sale you have about 24.9 mill in sales/month. Now as we all know but maybe Melvin/citadel haven’t figured it out yet they have made massive enemies out of every single stockholder. Meaning that each and every single GameStop holder will never buy anything with regards to gaming anywhere else.....EVER. Along with the fact that now every single fucking person on Planet earth has and will hear about GameStop. So now let’s say that visitor rate increases 3x that’s 12mill/month and that turns into 1.2 mill sales/month with an avg of $60. Woof you can see where this is going. Can’t you? You(Melvin/Citadel) have created a fully functional lifestyle gaming brand that HASN’T even started yet and you’re shorting has given it a share price of $200. As investors we thank you so much for believing in our fledging company and what it has to offer the gaming community. Hahahaha man would I love to be on the GameStop board even just apart of the marketing team. You’re so fucked it’s not even funny. This is a marketing/comms team slam fucking dunk and it’s not even started. The shorters better get their shit together because imma go so fucking long on this investment I ain’t never letting go. I don’t even really want a squeeze I just want a $1,000 share price just by fundamentals so we can all shove it down your fucking boomer throats. God damn I can’t wait to watch Cramer suck RC’s dick live on air. That will taste so good. Imma lick the tears off Melvin’s and Citadel’s cheeks.",

# Closing Remarks

I once again will not be doing any analysis on these graphs and numbers, I'm sure someone else will be happy to do that. This is strictly informative and for the sake of this post I am neither bearish nor bullish on GME. I hope some of you find this post useful and informative and I encourage anyone to use this data coupled with their own research and determinations to work on a DD. Once again, I will try my best to answer questions or collect more information but depending that may prove challenging based on the number of requests.

With that said I hope everyone has a fantastic weekend, if you've been staring at a screen all week, there is no better time to take a break. Mental health is important through all of this craziness, drink water, get some fresh air and sunlight, and just decompress. Cheers.",['TWTR']

I see a lot of confusion about this. (It also wouldn’t have mattered if they closed above $14 or below $200) 

**First** those large prints you see on the tape at 4 PM? That’s NORMAL. Every day at 16:00:02 the first NYSE closing print goes up. This tends to be larger on all Fridays, triple, and quad witching days due to opex. https://www.nyse.com/network/article/nyse-closing-auction?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=banner

This is not mAnIPulATIOn. This is how the market works. The reason you see the price jump/ change right at 4:00 is you’re watching the tick data until 3:59:59 then at 4:00:02 they put up the first closing auction print. 

On to the options component of our class - 

Obviously explaining gamma, delta, dealer hedging and open interest is really not getting through to you smooth brains. So I’m going to try a practical approach.

Use the TWO WRINKLES YOU HAVE and think for ONE SECOND. Would the option market work if every time a dealer sold a call option they just sat around and waited until Friday afternoon to figure out if they needed to have shares to deliver for In the money (ITM) options?? Would that make ANY SENSE?! That people went and bought $200 3/19 GME options 2 weeks ago for $20 and the dealer just sat in their chair staring at their screen? And at 4 PM today dealers short calls from $125 to $200 went “oh well looks like I’m short $300M of GME I have to go buy next week.”

OF COURSE NOT. This is what we mean by delta hedging. They have already bought stock as a hedge. As the price went up they bought more. That’s the “gamma squeeze.”

As people close out their positions on Friday the dealers are unwinding. Some options will be exercised and... good news for the dealers! They have the stock! Because they hedged it!

There’s all sorts of slightly technical reasons there’s small overhangs at 4:00 but it’s mostly done. 

Second practical point- HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR YOU TO REALIZE ITS NOT HOW IT WORKS? Every Friday we hear “if the stock closes above/ below X then Y will happen next week.” And it doesn’t. Because QUITE OBVIOUSLY if that was the case you would see HUGE movements AH. Spoiler alert- you guys aren’t the only ones that can see open interest. Put on your practical hat again. Don’t you think if the entire street saw 30M options ITM and thought that many shares needed to be bought Monday they would do it... now?

Options markets matter and you should learn more because it can illuminate what’s happening in stocks (Ie last week someone bought a whole lot of GME calls and set off this rally) but price at expiry matters very little. There’s slightly more to it (you can look up “pin risk” and “Max pain” if you’re interested I’m trying to get the most basic concepts across here). The reason AMC traded in such a tight range is because it got pinned at the $14 price due to large OI. This is not manipulation and is just due to mechanical hedging by dealers.",['PM']

m978bh,,wallstreetbets,post,1616247522,"Disproving claims published in CNBC using data on WSB discussionYesterday, CNBC and Market Watch published [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/stimulus-checks-unlikely-to-spur-another-gamestop-mania-says-bofa.html) on research concluding that we shouldn't expect people to use stimulus money to buy GameStop stock. One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that “the number of recent conversations \[on Reddit\] including both GME and stimulus is low.”

As some of you know, I’ve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.

I'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below.

To start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning ""stimulus"" or ""stimmy"" over time:

[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)

Here is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:

[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)

The drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:

[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)

From both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.

|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|
|:-|:-|
|3/15/21|124|
|3/14/21|103|
|3/16/21|74|
|3/13/21|69|
|1/14/21|67|

To take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.

[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\/ \\""stimmy ratio\\""](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)

I don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.

Note:  I don’t have stake in $GME and don’t actively trade a portfolio, in order to avoid perceptions of bias in my analysis. This is not financial advice, or a recommendation to buy or sell any stock.",['TSLA']

m8ef72,,wallstreetbets,post,1616150245,"HEY CRAYON MUNCHERS: Want to know WHY the GME chart looks like this? Shitadel & Max Pain Theory.&#x200B;

[Image is copied from one of u\/chayse1984's posts](https://preview.redd.it/j1sd6jde3yn61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d1d406b6d0ccc0b7b53c4f94f0cad9ee6d336a)

Your green and red candles don't form pretty little shapes for no reason, and it's not all *Brownian Motion* you stochastic cucks.

So we got two big fucking triangles up here, but do you even know *why*? Did you notice how both these triangles end on a Friday, dipshits? Okay... let me tell you a story.

It's 2002. Young high-flying Kenny G coked up off his fabulously successful hedge fund Shitadel decided fuck-you money wasn't enough for him. So he set out to dominate the world of centralized finance and become a **Market Maker**. This was the start of **Shitadel Securities**, the company that now pays millions of dollars to laugh at what options you're buying on the toilet.

Almost immediately following its conception, Shitadel Securities takes off like a rocket. Around this time, MMs start quoting stock and option prices in penny increments instead of quarters, meaning MMs had to compete with each other by taking a risk on holding onto the right securities at the right time. And boy does Shitadel, **an options MM nonetheless,** have an appetite for risk. Shitadel Securities does so well that Kenny starts getting cocky and thinks he can turn Shitadel into an **Investment Bank**, the king of Chicago. But Wall Street smells his bullshit all the way from New York, and Kenny fails to penetrate the industry.

Devastated. For the first time in Kenny's padded, cushiony life, he faces what still isn't real hardship. Too uncool for the club, it's at this point that Kenny decides to take out his insecurities (aha, get it?) on retail investors. Shitadel doubles down on something we are all now familiar with: **Payment for Order Flow**, a practice pioneered by none other than **Bernie Madoff**. E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, First Trade, TradeStation,  Interactive Brokers Lite, and yes, Robinhood, all contract with Shitadel for PFOF. It's with a heavy heart that I tell you, **even Fidelity's options are routed to Shitadel under PFOF**.

This brings us to today with Shitadel Securities as the largest **internalizer** in finance. ""Oh for fucks sakes, what the hell is an *internalizer* now?""

[At least the SEC made a pretty little graphic for us, right?](https://preview.redd.it/zi54ada2jyn61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35d47e4619234795a25b30a30a9c9a5af96167c)

In PFOF, your order is sent from whatever **discount brokerage** you're using to Shitadel Securities, who decides to either: A) pass your order onto the open market, where we like to watch a little green and red candles jump around or B) to take the other side of your order (short whatever you long, or long whatever you short) **at which point the life of your order ends, never making it to the open market**.

You heard me right. **When you use a discount brokerage like Robinhood, your order may never land on the open market.** But this is fine right?... Well let's imagine that there's only one monopolistic internalizer trading a security, and that internalizer is internalizing all the retail volume trying to buy a security. Even if millions of retail traders are buying the security, **the stock price on the open market wouldn't move, there would be no volume on the open market, and the internalizer would have a massive short position on the stock that they have to unload.** What this looks like in the world of green and red candles is a **massive bull flag while the internalizer is internalizing** and **massive upward breakouts when the internalizer unloads their short position**.

*Okay, but in order for Shitadel to do this, they would need to be a monopoly, right?*

[From https:\/\/www.citadelsecurities.com\/products\/equities-and-options\/](https://preview.redd.it/e9dxgz1npyn61.png?width=1759&format=png&auto=webp&s=27801bbcd469eda01dc0e172a6bccb9de6c2e96b)

*Okay, but if Shitadel were to do this, their smaller competitors would be able to gauge retail sentiment, even if retail volume is hidden from the exchange, and drive the price up before Shitadel, right?*

[An obvious short attack. https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/gamestop-stock-price-trading-halts-volatility-spike-176-trading-range-2021-3-1030170445 ](https://preview.redd.it/ftjhzgexoyn61.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=1883bbf2e32492ca9614c4ec57b3a19fe1ad705b)

*Okay, okay. But why would Shitadel do this? Wouldn't it be so expensive for them in terms of* ***Impact Cost?***

Remember how Shitadel Securities is an **options** MM? Notice how everyone's options lose a ton of money from the start to the end of these bull flags? Notice how the bull flags end on Fridays? It's my opinion that **Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.** A day like today is very dangerous for an internalizer doing this. If the price jumps out of their control, not only do they lose money on all their shorts, they also lose money on all their options. If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS.

# Boom.

&#x200B;

\----- P.S. -----

Want to know what the stochastic cucks call this? **Max Pain Theory.**

Want to know my opinion on how to trades options on this? Buy leaps on Fridays like these, and ~~sell~~ not buy weeklies during bull flags like this.

&#x200B;

Tldr; Shitadel is spending millions of dollars on short attacks to make billions of dollars on your options expiring worthless.  If enough people realize this and lay on the buy pressure, it can blow up in Shitadel's face and trigger the MOASS. 🚀🚀🚀s on  🚀🚀🚀s on  🚀🚀🚀s.

I read somewhere he holds 90% of the company. No wonder index did not want to get involved. If you want to hold 90% of the company you should have left it private. Why even go public?

Index or no index, the stock is still undervalued by all metrics. The only problem in my opinion is that CEO is holding too much stake in the company. He wants to get rich of index buying, but they are not stupid. Why would one single person hold 90% of the company? If you want your company to be private then don't go public. There are many great companies like IKEA and Lego that are private because the families that own them did not want to sell their shares.

Brace yourself for bagholding. If you ask me, you should be selling options on this confusing stock. Don't get fooled into buying options. This one is not a stock for the beginners. You need to play intelligently. You need to play the strategies that pay you, not the other way around.

m93mec,,wallstreetbets,post,1616232745,"UWMC not added to Russel Indices...What now? Why you shouldn’t panic sell. A value play and long term hold: Part 2So, the news broke yesterday that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 or 3000. This justifiably has some investors upset and ready to sell. I’m going to make a case for holding, or even adding more. 

I previously made a DD that was fairly popular where I called UWMC a swing play, a value play, and a long term hold rolled into one. Well, the swing play already happened with the run to $12. There was another run to $10 recently as well. We could have seen a bigger swing with index inclusion, but that’s not happening now. I banked $4,000 on those swings, so I can’t complain too much there. However, I understand that some people bought in the run-up with higher prices in mind. There were some posts on here with stupid price targets and “short squeeze” hype. I called these posts out as I saw them. I never thought UWM was wise to jump into for a squeeze alone, even with high short interest, and some here definitely FOMOd into some really bad DD. In fact, I think the guy who kept hyping a squeeze deleted his account. 

But the truth is that many bought at the $10+ mark and now feel lost. Well, this post is for you. 

First of all, I agree that not being included in the indices is bad news. I thought this would be a good catalyst myself. However, I also believe that there is an overreaction here. UWMC may very well have ticked up a couple of percentage points on Russell inclusions, but I think that for the long term, this doesn’t change too much. 

This is why, even without Russell inclusion, UWMC may be a worthy part of your portfolio:


- Price targets and analyst ratings for UWMC:

4 buys, 1 hold.

Low: 10.50
Average: 11.70
High: 13.50

This represents a 19-53% upside from current share price. 

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UWMC/research-ratings

- This company is trading at value multiples, with a P/E in the 6-7 range and 1.83b revenue in the most recent quarter. More quarters with minuscule interest rates are on the horizon, and I would be shocked if UWM doesn’t put up monster numbers. I think they will likely upgrade their dividend and make a run up over the course of the year. Analysts seem to agree with this outlook. The fed reiterated that rates are going nowhere.

- There was recently an insider buy of 60,000 shares at around $8. This was more than a double down on his previous 50,000 shares. If he’s that bullish at $8, then I would say anything below $8.50 is a great buy. Even at the current $8.80 price, we are only 10% above the insider purchase. 

- Even if there is no dividend upgrade, the current dividend is 40 cents a year, which comes out to 4.5% of the current price. This is a very solid dividend for an income play. 

- Earnings will likely be in early May. With no index inclusion, I would say late April would be the next catalyst to watch for a run up. If you really want to sell, I would advise waiting until that time rather than taking a big loss Monday. 

- As a result of the recent spat with RKT, UWMC has enlisted a minimum of 65% and likely in the end around 75-80% of independent brokers who previously worked with UWMC and RKT to sign an addendum that restricts them from working with RKT. Considering the wholesale channel is expected to increase its share of the market until 2025, this gives UWMC a giant advantage in capturing more market share. (I’m bullish on RKT too for different reasons, but UWMC is the king of brokers in the mortgage industry and will win the broker battle IMO)

- EPS is expected to INCREASE in 2021 per analyst estimates. This is opposed to competitors that are expected to have a slower 2021. And when interest rates do increase, UWM expects to become an even more powerful influence in the industry due to their reliance on purchase business rather than refinance. 

- UWM is investing in technology by the billions, and they already have far and away the fastest closing times in the industry. They hold what one might call a “moat.” That’s how you grow a company. 

Some bear points:

- The RKT ultimatum could lead to litigation and bad press. I don’t think anything will come of it, but bad press could bring the share price down. 

- The market could collapse/the housing market could cool off. I’d say that if you’re in the industry, you know that the housing market isn’t cooling off any time soon. However, I won’t claim to be all-knowing, so perhaps this could happen.

- Interest rates could rise substantially, and much sooner than expected. Highly unlikely, but possible. 

- Maybe the RKT ultimatum pushes business away from UWM, and they lose out to RKT. I’d say this is the biggest risk right now to be honest, but I do believe UWM will come out on top based on my experience in the industry and based off of what is being reported. I have also heard some personal stories about the situation. However, if UWM starts to lose more market share, that changes everything. 

- The stock market simply undervalues mortgage companies right now, and one could argue that this may never change. I would say that we are already seeing it change with RKT and UWM, and that it will gradually change as these companies continue to put up huge numbers. 


Let me reiterate: UWMC was never a GME type play. It was a good swing play, and now it is a great value and long term play. I would spend some time thinking about whether that matches your investing goals, and if not, get out on Monday or hold until the earnings run-up.

I am personally going to be buying the dip if it comes on Monday. Considering the current share price provides 20% upside to the LOWEST analyst estimates, I am excited to buy the dip to be honest. 

This post is not for my own benefit. My average is pretty good and I am prepared to average down. I just know that some of the people here really got screwed by some bad DD, and wanted to provide my own outlook on why you may be fine. My current position is 1250 @ 8.47.",

The Longs are smart, they knew they wanted to play this sideways all week.  They know the Shorts are playing both sides of this game.  Shorts are buying all the Calls 250+, just in case they find themselves out of position even more than they already are.  Additionally, the Shorts doubled down and bought thousands of PUTs.  the magic number was 200.  We just put a clinic on them, the LONGs have us holding that support.  We're not selling and the Longs know that.  So, lets look at next week...  once these AMC peeps realize we've been the endgame all along they'll come back.  They chased 15 bucks and got burned.  With GME earnings report coming out Tuesday and ETFs adjusting next week. Apes will find direction and community support will follow.  We won guys, we won big.

**TLDR**: If you own the stock, you're winning.  If you need more ""dry powder"" to buy more GME. Go to Costco and refund anything you ever bought there.  They'll give you cash and boom... You can keep this fire burning!

m8odcj,,wallstreetbets,post,1616180402,"Please stop using IBorrowDesk as your only source of hedge funds borrowing sharesLike all of you, I've been looking at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) to keep an eye on the amount of shares remaining for hedge funds to borrow. However, about a week ago I decided that my brain was just a little too smooth (my wife's boyfriend told me to wrinkle up, whatever that means), and I took a look at the FAQ on the iborrowdesk website.

Link for the lazy [https://iborrowdesk.com/faq](https://iborrowdesk.com/faq)

At the very bottom, the FAQ says the following:

""It's also worth noting that IBorrowDesk only tracks Interactive Brokers data - it could be that other brokerages have many shares available. Professional or institutional investors have access to data sources far more sophisticated than this site - which can only track a single, albeit very large and active, brokerage.""

At first I was confused, and picked my nose with an axe. Then, I had a jimmy nerdtron brainblast, and realized this meant that IBorrowDesk does not showcase all of the available shares to borrow for shorting purposes. Investigating the amount of shares available to borrow from other brokers is key to monitoring what the hedge funds are up to. Relying solely on IBorrowDesk is incomplete data at best, and confirmation bias at worst.

I am not a financial advisor, but I want people to be aware that they're not looking at the full data.

Per Investopedia, the Sharpe ratio ""is used to help ~~investors~~ retards understand the return of ~~an investment~~ a 401k YOLO compared to its risk.﻿ The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Conceptually, what this provides is a measurement of the portfolio’s outperformance per unit of the portfolio’s volatility.""

(Honestly, I was expecting the stimulus to put us back up on track, but oh well).

This is what I'm expecting to happen:

Notice we've been in that bearish funnel for a while now, and will probably test $150 before too long. After that's completed, I'm expecting to see a lot of support down there, but also intense volatility.

Now, if that holds, we're gonna try to swing up out of the channel; if it breaks, we're going down to test $115 as well.

Reason why I'm expecting us to be down is due options behavior around the next expiration dates:

&#x200B;

That's a huge short position expiring on April 1st. Also, notice how the calls/puts ratio drops from one expiration to another. To me this says people are waiting for the price to drop to get in cheaper.

m8r4yt,,wallstreetbets,post,1616188098,"SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GMEThere has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. 

THE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

In its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y’all but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here’s the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. 

EVERY BD(PB)’s ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT 

Think of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or “special” security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let’s look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. 

CONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. 

Although the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone’s stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. 

The only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  

Given that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren’t showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or “GC” (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. 

Don’t even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   

Hope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today. Rest assured THERE ARE MILLIONS OF GME SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.","['JPM', 'DE', 'STT', 'GS']"

m8s292,,wallstreetbets,post,1616190648,"Imagine insistently opposing a giant group of gamers after trying to destroy their home.""*You come to ape's jungle and try cut down our tree? Then try burn whole jungle?!""*

Gamers are some of the most strong-willed and tenacious people on the planet. We regularly spend hours in highly toxic and competitive arenas... **AND WE FUCKING LOVE IT!** 

Now, we stand before the real life- **""Level: 100 of 100 Gatekeepers,""** that have been hacking the game for centuries, with almost complete amnesty from the Moderation and Dev teams. 

In these online arenas, we not only face our opposition head-on, but communicate with them on a personal level. Any cheaters are usually caught, banned, and punished. Effectively, making these online lobbies, with virtually no real-life stake, more governed and moderated than **the fucking stock market...** and that speaks volumes! 

The SEC's intervention into this broken, cheated, and rigged game is overwhelmingly pathetic. 

When you consider the real-life stake that is on-the-line in the stock market, with it being people's livelihood & futures at potential risk, where is the balance here? -You're telling me, that a virtual world with no real-life stake, is just, much more fair than the latter? That is so incredibly ass-hat backwards. 

That's why as community, we need to voice our interests, ideas, and opinions of GameStop's future- Re-imagining the possibilities and laying-out a vision for its potential future. 

Personally, I see the largest gaming organization of all time, with a brick and mortar foundation that's paved and primed for endless possibilities. Storefronts that offer everything in consoles, to a flourishing mecca for PC gamers, \[along the likes of micro-center,\] *(which btw has limited locations w/ little infrastructure for expansion.)* Each store having gaming lounges, where local gamers can team-up, practice, and compete. An annual eSports Championship that covers every competitive title, with total coverage and a production value of the Superbowl/Olympics... Lastly, a thriving eCommerce platform with the same vitality as of everything aforementioned. 

It seems the future of GameStop still remains a bit hazy, we all have different ideas of what it could be, and no real conceptualizations for what it will become. If we started sculpting a collective vision of what we see for GameStop, the more conviction every ape will have. Drastically reducing the amount of paper-handed bitches- **Apes together strong!**

So I will start with I saw someone's DD the past two weeks and I started diving in and I like where ASO is at.  I am going to keep this short and sweet.  Last quarters earnings proj at .36, actual was .91.  This was early December.  Christmas and two damn  stimmys later and this quarter is March 30th for earnings release with the Trailing 12 looking very nice (Up 10% rev).  ""But stimmys go to GME like good ape should"" ... and I agree.  But the customers they cater to are not apes my fellow apes.  They are of the reddest of necks.  And rednecks don't need bananas, they need guns and ammo! (Cue 80's Rock mix)

Here is their company description.

The company sells a range of sporting and outdoor recreation products, including sporting equipment, apparel, footwear, camping gear, patio furniture, outdoor cooking equipment, and hunting and fishing gears primarily under the Academy Sports + Outdoors, Magellan Outdoors, BCG, O'rageous, and Outdoor Gourmet brand names. As of August 1, 2020, it operated 259 Academy Sports + Outdoors retail locations in 16 states and three distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia, and Cookeville, Tennessee. The company also sells merchandise to customers via academy.com website. Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is based in Katy, Texas.

&#x200B;

I even saw one that described the company as ""catering to local flavor"" by selling crawfish boilers....

&#x200B;

Need more info?  90 mil outstanding shares, 30 mil float and 12.5 mil shares shorted (40.3%) as of 2/26/21

TL;DR   Potential to Squeeze?  Who the fuck knows.  Potential to pop off naturally?  Fucking Maybe.  All I know is rednecks arent buying GME and they have too many damn kids so their Stimmys are huge.  What do you do when your trailer is paid off?  Buy more guns and Ammo.  $ASO Q4 looks amazing to me.

Minor pullbacks expected as wave (1) of (iii) completes between $286 and $322. Breaking resistance at 231.02 confirms upside. Holding above support keeps further downside as alternate count.

Resistance (wave i): 231.02

Major Support (wave 4): 172.50 

Minor Support (wave ii): 183.58

**Discussion**

After watching GME pullback in corrective fashion in overlapping waves finally completing at 183.58 today, wave 1 of iii took off, and completed five waves quickly (which we would expect in a 3rd wave such as iii), extending beyond the standard .618 extension of i from ii, nearly hitting the .764 extension before turning down at 227. This completes 1 of iii of (1) of (iii). We now wait to see how far 2 retraces 1, and from 2 we can more accurately calculate these minute subwaves. However, with 1 extending beyond a standard fib target, each subsequent wave should also be lifted by the same number of fibs surpassed. In lifting these targets, we have the following regions: 3 \~ 264; iii \~286; (i) between 286 and 382.

**Conclusion:** As long as the minor support holds, we have room to run. Only a break of 183.58 forces us to consider today's upside as a new b wave of an incomplete ii. A break of 172.5 forces us to consider that the large green 4 has not yet completed. Alt yellow count remains, but as long as new supports are developed and held, we shouldn't worry about that for now. ENJOY the UPSIDE!

m8vckk,,wallstreetbets,post,1616200289,"UWMC Russell InclusionOk so I have a decent position in UWMC, picture in another post.  I was curious to try to predict exactly what Russell 1000 and 3000 inclusion would do.

For those who don't know, these are both market-cap weighted funds.  The Russell 3000 is the 3000 biggest companies in the US, which makes them about 98% of the US stock market by market cap.  The Russell 1000 is the biggest 1000 of the Russell 3000, which makes them about 90% of the stock market.

Since the whole US stock market is a bit above $50T, that makes the Russell 3000 about $50T and the Russell 1000 about $45T.  They are honestly not that different, the Russell 3000 just contains an extra 2000 companies which barely move the needle, because it's market-cap weighted (not equal-weight)

Ok so once I figured that out, my next question was, exactly how many funds track these indexes?  The answer was disappointing.  There are two main ETFs for each (iShares and Vanguard).   And then there are a bunch of little mutual funds.  I couldn't get a complete list but I doubt that all of this combined adds up to much more than $50B in assets (comparitively, SPY is just one ETF and it has $330B in net assets, and that doesn't count all the mutual funds that track the S&P 500)

So as a really rough estimate, 0.11% of a Russell 1000 company's market cap will be in these funds.  (maybe a little more, like 0.12% or 0.13%)

The one thing that UWMC had going for it is that it's market cap is large and the float is small -- only 6% of the market cap.  So that means that in order to buy 0.11% of the market cap, they have to buy about 1.83% of the float.  Let's round up to 2% because I didn't look at all the mutual funds.  I could not really find a good source of data here.

Conclusion:  ETFs and mutual funds need to buy about 2% of UWMC's float.  That's about 2 million shares.  Average daily volume is about 10M shares.  There might be a small boost but this is not a massive squeeze or anything.

S&P 500 would be a much bigger deal but they have requirements on the float for precisely this reason.  UWMC will never be in the S&P until they release more shares into the float.",['SPGI']
m8vckk,grjlebo,wallstreetbets,comment,1616201722,"Hi. So I’m not arguing that inclusion will make a HUGE difference but you’re a little off on your calcs. 

That’s because in addition to “Russell 1000” ETFs there are also “Russell 1000 Value” and “Russell 1000 Growth” ETFs, which are actually more popular and have more assets. 
Safe to assume that UWMC will be in R1000 Value. The iShares ETF (IWD) has $50B in AUM. Vanguard,s is much smaller ($5B) 
So iShares R1000 (IWB) has $26B its R1000 Value has $50B, Vanguard’s R1000 (VONE) has $5B and its R1000 Value (VONV) has $5B.

There are other funds and ETFs that track the Russell 1000 as well. Question is how big UWMC would be in it and I don’t know the calcs.",

m8ei9r,,wallstreetbets,post,1616150612,"Why AMC is a BUY - An Employee Perspective\*This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor\*

So to start this off, I used to be a manager for one of AMC's largest competitors, Cinemark (CNK). When covid happened, my stock portfolio took a major hit along with the market, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been. I started to look for the companies that got hit hard by the pandemic, but would bounce back stronger once the country opened back up. I immediately had movie theaters in mind for some sweet investment potential.

In the past year, CNK hit a low of $5.71 and AMC went down to $1.91 and I had to pick which horse to bet on. I opted to go all in on CNK because they were in a better financial situation, and maybe I was biased from having worked there, but it made the most sense to me until all of this came about.

As AMC climbed up to around $20 during that initial wave, my CNK went up by association, I sold, and then I turned my attention towards GME midway through the first climb and made a quick profit. Afterwards, I returned to my original movie theater plan, only this time, I was all in on AMC.

In my opinion, AMC now has the highest return potential out of all the movie theater chains, even without the short squeeze.

In early 2015 and late 2016/early 2017, both Cinemark and AMC had record breaking years. CNK stock was 1.9x higher at around $45 and AMC was 2.5x higher at around $35. Business was booming, but it wasn't really because the theaters were doing anything different, it was because the studios released A TON of record breaking movies during that time, which brought in massive revenue for theaters.

39 of the Top 50 highest grossing films were released in the last decade and 38 of those grossed over $1 billion in international box office revenue. With all the huge upcoming films, and the ones that got postponed from covid, and all the pent up demand to go to the movies, I am very confident that this trend will continue and that we'll see new record breaking films over the next few years and even the next decade.

Another concern that people were bringing up is that streaming services and VOD studio releases are going to kill movie theaters in the long run, and I think that this is completely wrong. As I just mentioned, 78% of the highest grossing films of all time came out in the last decade. While streaming services may have replaced brick and mortar video rental stores, they couldn't replace the experience of going to the movies and catching the latest film on the big screen and the increase in theater attendance over the last decade proves it.

During AMC's Q4 conference call, the CEO mentioned that over half of their customers were return customers and that they were able to track this through their AMC Stubs memberships and from my time working for their competition, I can confirm that this was the same case over at Cinemark. We had dedicated return customers that would see a movie \*at least\* once a week, seniors especially. Those seniors fucking loved a discount day and they also just liked to get out of the house.

With the country opening back up, restrictions lifted, vaccines expected to be available for all adults by May, and 98% of AMC theaters to be open by tomorrow, that brings back the regulars which made up over half their business and everything is looking green in the months to come.

I am 100% ALL IN on AMC and I have full confidence in the stock, but let's play devil's advocate:

Worst case scenario, the big squeeze doesn't happen (it will), the company struggles to pay off it's debt while accruing more debt and then they start to go under, in which case, they will more than likely get acquisitioned by another company. Amazon, Netflix, or maybe one of their competitors, and then the shareholders see a nice payday. This scenario would take the longest to play out, which is the only major downside.

Realistic Scenario, the big squeeze happens, \*possibly\* even breaking the quadruple digits, apes get tendies, the stock normalizes, and we have a party in the ruins of the hedgefunds that dared to bet against us.

Best cast scenario, the big squeeze is fucking ridiculous, we all get super rich and buy condos on the moon.

In any case, the only way to make money on AMC is to buy and hold.

Dear Apes,
What you just witnessed with AMC at the last 2 minutes of the market close, was horrible. We get back at them by selling our shares at extreme prices for both GME and AMC, so the Hf and their traders looses everything, their Manhattan penthouse, their chauffeured Bentley, their Michelin star chefs and regret their whole lives thinking a bunch of apes, turned their whole lives upside down. 
That’s the price I want for 2008, for apes holding these stocks, their mental fatigue, all the sleepless nights, their kids, family, house, medical, students at schools. This is enough.
I do insist all the day traders and investors to make money through other stocks and dump in these stocks, take help from your fellow friends, apes help each other make money by holding and making each other get their desired prices. Us divided is what they are praying on, imagine us united will make those big boys piss their pants, they are 1% cause we have our money invested in their companies. Their ability to manipulate, cheat and bend the rules to their will, I say that’s enough. We have seen enough, I am humbled, but really pissed. Today a lot of my fellow apes have options OTM and who is responsible the HF, the powerful institutions and financial market caretakers are doing nothing about it. Who is suffering us, us retail investors and traders. 
Look out for each other, all our lives we have competed with one another making money out of each other, this is the one time we can make the money off the 1% I say we take it. Win or loose is upto god, but not trying will be on us. 
It’s not the end of your life even a day can change your life, be positive, relax and trust the path you have chosen for yourselves. 
I myself own 180@14 AMC and 80@230 GME shares, keeping some money to buy more, I am trying and hoping for the best.  
Hold and buy if possible don’t loose hope not now, not when things might go our way for once in life.

m8t9nq,,wallstreetbets,post,1616193931,"$GME “Conservative” Outlook; Technical Analysis – MACD, W%R, DMI BasedI have been seeing GME squeeze by “x” date a lot in this sub, and I think its fun to theorize when it will happen. However, the truth is we don’t know when it will happen, and it’s almost impossible to try to guess.

What we can do however is predict the next bearish or bullish cycles within GME, and we can position ourselves accordingly to trade well. For example, holders can have an idea of how long they need to hold so you don’t get spooked into selling too early, and buyers can enter in at educated price points.

GME is currently in the very last days of its bullish MACD sentiment. In the chart below we can see that on 2/25 MACD flipped to positive, triggering the start of a bull run. As of 3/19 the MACD histogram bar is very low and with W%R and +DI trending down it looks like on Monday MACD will flip to negative, confirming a bear run.

[2\/25 - 3\/19](https://preview.redd.it/jzkjlx5hb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5835a25e613d379340c2f52da7b1004b1de4deec)

Now, the question is how long will bearish sentiment last for? For reference lets look at the last two times the MACD histogram was negative:

&#x200B;

[1\/27-2\/26](https://preview.redd.it/n35a3qlkb2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e93ef2c67df5f7598139d211144db90b76e987)

In this example (2/4-2/24), we can see that bearish sentiment lasted about 14 trading days. We should note however, that this is right after huge volume and sudden spike in price.

Now another example:

&#x200B;

[12\/8-1\/13](https://preview.redd.it/0x6qf54ob2o61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10e245f52cb96382e7eeca802024346475218c7)

Looking back from 12/10-1/12 we can see that GME was following a 6 to 8 day bearish to bullish trend. Important to note is that these trends did not spike the price too much and volume was relatively low.

Now looking ahead to 3/22 and onward, I can safely predict that there should be a bearish trend. This doesn’t necessarily mean prices will dramatically plummet but institutions know that trying to raise prices against negative MACD momentum isn’t favorable. Also, I can also say that if a bearish trend starts, it should last something like 6-14 days. Our most recent bullish trend had decent volume and there was also a pretty dramatic price change, and so I think the real number will in the middle of those two extremes.

Now I know that is a very large window of time, but it really does depend on what happens during the next two weeks to determine if the MACD histogram will overturn. Events like the earnings report on 3/23, and if RC announces a CEO position could help overturn sentiment.

I'm sorry if this doesn't feed your confirmation bias or if you think im trying to spread FUD. I just wanted to share so we can make educated trades and stay in the game longer so we can get this thing to squeeze!

m8olrf,,wallstreetbets,post,1616181027,"Why RKT is not just a mortgage company with an appFirst of all, I see a lot of ""I like the stock cuz it's undervalued"". Undervalued compared to what? Traditional and pure-play companies deserves a low forward P/E and P/S because they don't have the potential to scale up, innovate, and revolutionize their industry - they are only there to make constant small profit for shareholders. This is why these companies will eventually have constant dividend and not reinvest back into the company expansion. Makes for good retirement investment where you want constant income. On the other hand, tech companies need to have either a new technology/product or have some way to digitally transform the industry that can quickly scale.

RKT has spent billions of dollars creating their own broker tools that's customizable, as well as investing in data analytics and AI-assisted automation. They have a 2500-strong software team in Detroit. RKT is not just a mortgage company with an app (although I've heard their app is pretty good). Just look at their acquisitions and some of their other businesses:

1. Nexsys Technologies makes a platform for mortgage lenders that automate homeowner insurance verification, and is being integrated with Lemonade
2. Lendesk, a Canadian aquisition that makes end-to-end digital mortgage solutions
3. forsalebyowner is a property listing site, kinda like zillow and redfin
4. Finally, their flagship rocket mortgage/quicken loans is the first digital mortgage experience - they are the ones who brought on the digital revolution of the mortgage industry. They are the real OGs and are continuing to innovate.

If you think Lemonade is a tech company (it is), then RKT is a tech company. Even more, it's a tech company that has succeeded in its own field and is rapidly expanding/acquiring. 

On the other hand, everyone is familiar with the feud between RKT and UWMC, and arguments for which is a better company. While I think UWMC has done well in recent year in terms of rapidly expanding in the broker channel, I don' think they are a tech company and thus shouldn't have a long term high forward valuation. Their flagship platform for brokers, Blink+, is a third party software that they pay per use (see their [S1 filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-016729/)). So here they save the initial investment that makes the finances look better for IPO, but will eat into their margins later.",

m8olrf,grikmuy,wallstreetbets,comment,1616182868,"Watching people *actually shill* for companies like this warms my heart. You did your research, too.

Most WSB ""meme stocks"" are meant to be bought low and sold high. You see Rocket Mortgage as an *actual investment* that will grow in the future.

As you are taking this as a real investment, here is the advice I can give:

1. **Reinvest the dividends.** Not all stocks do this, but if they do, make sure you ask your broker (or the  ""Robin Hood"" App, etc.) to do this automatically. This accrues stock without spending more money.

2. ***""Diamond Hands"" is NOT just a meme!*** **Prepare to buy and hold for decades.** Resisting the urge to fold and panic sell when stocks fall is something that Mauldin Economics says takes discipline that few men have. Having true Diamond Hands is extremely rare, especially when bubbles pop. It is easy to say it and hard to do it. A man that bought a few hundred shares of Johnson-Johnson when it first went public in the forties would have tens of millions of dollars today, and even more if he followed the previous point. Maybe Rocket Mortgage could be your Johnson-Johnson? Only time and Diamond Hands will tell.

3. One of my favorite economists said that if you are a really savvy investor AND an investor with Diamond Hands, **you should not need to check you portfolio every day, or even every week**. You should not constantly obsess over your long-term investments. You are in it for the long run; Diamond Hands pay the best over MANY years! Ideally, you don't intensely follow it until you are very old.

4. **Start saving for retirement the day you get your first job. Do not put your life savings in stock alone.** With hardcore Diamond Hands and reinvesting the dividends, stocks can legitimately be a real source of wealth. That doesn't mean you should not diversify into other stocks and stable investments like real estate.

5. **If your job ever offers stock options, take them.** A stock option is a contract guaranteeing a certain price at which you are allowed to purchase a set number of shares. There is no better deal than this if you think your employer is going somewhere.

6. **You WILL lose money in some investments. Stock markets are casinoes: as with any gambling,** ***NEVER invest money you cannot afford to completely lose,*** **and never, EVER take loans to invest in stocks.**

7. **Buy bonds.** Bonds are boring and make small interest payments, but they always work. They don't give much money, but unless you're into ""bonks"" and not good bonds (AKA junk bonds and insolvent corporations' bonds), you will ALWAYS turn a profit.


You are taking this very seriously and I LOVE to see such optimism and enthusiasm in investing. I LOVE watching other people make money! You already demonstrated your research and are probably going to expand on it. Take this advice to heart and invest prudently.

I hope that, one day, when you've worked all your life and you finally retire, you will look back at WSB and your choices and relish in the fact that you put your money to work.

Happy investing! May your fortunes fly to the moon and may your hands never fold!",

**Update 3/19 mid day:**

I realized the entire problem with last week's edition was that I forgot the fucking rocket emojis.  Never again. 🚀 🚀 🚀 

Doing this one early because your boy is heated.  To be fair, I **was pretty explicit about having low confidence in plays this week due to FOMC flukiness**--and that this was probably the closest I come to sitting shit out without sitting shit out--but still disappointed.  I don't like to let the people down!

**Word of caution**🐻 : Next week is **post-quad witching**, a historically volatile week for stocks.  For that reason I am still bagholding some VXX, choosing entries with caution, and keeping plenty of dry powder.  I don't care what Jerome says about inflation, this is not face-first YOLO time.

****

**Last week’s baggers:** Although the Tier 1 beating got most of the attention, **GPRO CS DB AAPL** all printed.  **VXX** on a ventilator but still (barely) in the game as of this writing.

**Last week’s lessons:** VIX is too unpredictable--SPY puts are the way if you have a bearish sentiment.  Also, **if you have as little confidence as I said I had last week, just sit it out**--there's no shame in kicking back. 

****

**Plays with RAMBO**

[GM](https://i.imgur.com/pLLrckZ.jpg) & 3/22 [Conference Event](https://i.imgur.com/Y8i7aE7.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

SUPER consistent OTM call buying over the past two weeks.  Unsure if this RAMBO on Monday is necessarily THE catalyst but it's worth finding out.  Either way, you're rolling with a ticker that has seen some of the most frenzied UOA for a boomer stock this quarter.  It couldn't hold above 60 after the first run, so anything lower than that may be worth getting in to see if it crosses and if 60 becomes support after the event Monday.

BUT WAIT! [There’s more....](https://i.imgur.com/zTXu6MU.jpg)

[DOCU](https://i.imgur.com/SWtoqGP.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

DOCU has an investor day coming up with that peculiar post-ER timing that screams ""pump"".  They've really slid since ER, and are floating around that nice, easy benchmark 200 number.  Look to grab if it touches or dips below, and hold through the RAMBO.  This got me on board:

>Consider this: 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies and seven of the top 10 global tech companies all utilize DocuSign’s technology. In addition, 800 federal, state and local government agencies utilize the company’s platform.

Imagine them talking about that kinda shit for hours on end during an INVESTOR DAY.  Yum.

🐻: there is put buying around DOCU right now, could be hedging, could likely be during this week’s sell offs people dropped, but it’s there and subject to interpretation

These two intriguing FB bets stood out to me as more than coincidental or tech flow.  Short dated, significantly outside the money, and one of them on the ask-side (a bullish sign).  I'm going to keep an eye on tech flow to ensure I like it, then probably test out a 4/9 290.  [Also, Zuckerberg is talking shit now like iOS priacy updates won't be the death of him.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/18/zuckerberg-facebook-may-be-in-stronger-position-after-apple-ios-14.html)

Lots of bearish hedge activity on each of these too, which can be a good sign, but also may mean the expected catalyst is fragile.

**Sector trends in whale bets/UOA I’ve picked up that mean something to me:**

1) **Chips**: It could be SEMICON, but all chip manufacturers are beginning to have more and more otm bets placed on them.  Chip shortage bla bla, but it could be time for them to make another run after getting snuffed out the past few times.

I'd venture that infrastructure is about to become a crucial frontier in the post-stimmy administration and now is the time to hop in.  I may follow some UOA on the X monthly, 30c.

Guess which demographic group is the most likely first time buyer? That's right, tech-savvy millennials who will likely shop for their mortgage online. RKT is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this, and they will also have a suit of complimentary offers such as home insurance, title services, and realtors, all in the Rocket/Quicken ecosystem. 
2. [DACA recipients will be eligible for federally insured mortgages.](https://themortgagereports.com/73772/fha-accepting-daca-home-loans) There are 700,000 DACA recipients. Again these are all young people, [with an average age of 24](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/25/key-facts-about-unauthorized-immigrants-enrolled-in-daca/). You can bet that they will likely shop for mortgages online. They are probably less likely to walk into a bank branch to ask for a mortgage.

I couldn't find any more recent statistics, but back in 2016 already [millennials were already twice as likely to use quicken mortgage](https://www.quickenloans.com/press-room/2017/03/07/fueled-rocket-mortgage-detroit-based-quicken-loans-achieves-record-breaking-year/). 

These catalyst, combined with the already conservative guidance, means RKT will crush expectations on their earnings for at least the next few quarters, maybe then they will earn the respect of the market.",
