I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial. This might be a fairly long post but I thought since the broad masses here probably don't know some of these companies I thought I'd make it a bit more comprehensive than just posting some tickers and percentages.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

ms4niw,,stocks,post,1618584286,"The New Normal - 25% of the S&P 100 companies are >70 RSI signaling ""overbought""I typically watch the top 100 companies daily. I find it entertaining more than anything. I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.

The RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.

If you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.

We see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.

I continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!

EDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.

Between the end of trading sessions on Friday April 16th 2021, and before the start of trading on Monday 19th April 2021, it is expected that Blackrock will rebalance their positions in ICLN/INRG in accordance to changes to thee S&P Global Clean Energy index to which they track.

This is starting to take place in New Zealand as trading hours are extended by 45 minutes to accommodate high volumes in both Meridian Energy and Contact Energy (both of which are seeing their weightings reduced). 

[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-extends-trading-hours-for-sp-global-index-change/2N4Q2ENY7W6TALMMRJBLWZ4XRM/](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-extends-trading-hours-for-sp-global-index-change/2N4Q2ENY7W6TALMMRJBLWZ4XRM/)

It is also expected that Plug Power, which drove much of the ETFs growth in 2020 (and demise in 2021 following a market correction and accounting errors), will see it's weighting gradually reduced. This will be of relief to many investors who are looking to bet on clean energy, but have been concerned by Plug's overweighting at \~10% of the index.

The restructuring will see the holdings of ICLN/INRG increase from \~30 to \~100, increasing it's diversity and it's stability. 

The rebalancing is likely to act as a watershed moment for the ETF which has been trading sideways since it bottomed out in March 2nd 2021 and is looking for a breakout opportunity. This morning INRG opened on the London Stock Exchange with a 2% gain in the first 90 minutes of trading.

The U.S. has just thrown a ton of supply and strong economic data at the bond market and it's had no impact. First it was the U.S. jobs report, then $120 billion of Treasury auctions, followed by consumer price inflation, and now retail sales. The 10-year yield slid to a one-month low.

We are in Terminator 2 territory now, where the rewired-good-guy-Arnold Schwarzenegger's bullets make silvery craters in the natty-but-somewhat-intense robot policeman... But the holes close up, and he's after them again with that odd choppy-handed sprint.

I find it extremely odd there are hardly any mentions of one of the literal biggest and oldest players in this field - Siemens Energy.

It's like Reddit has a grudge against older established companies, and expects some new techy company to overtake them overnight. I really do not find this to be the case in this industry. For instance, a company like Siemens Energy has almost one hundred billion in backlog. Meaning, they have secure revenue streams for decades to come thanks to their long term service programs for their technologies. So again, I don't see them vanishing seemingly overnight because some young stud from california invents something they haven't. There's a good chance they might just buy it.

The company just spun off into the only ""pure play"" energy company in the world, traded publicly. Unlike their primary competition, GE, they are not in financially troubling times, and have plenty of cash to do what they are aiming to do - reimagine themselves as a pure green energy company. They are the only company offering **today** conversions of gas fired plants to hydrogen fire (eliminating emissions), offer one of the biggest batteries in the world (through Fluence technology), have the largest installed fleet of wind turbines worldwide (Siemens Gamesa), and are on the leading technical edge for smart building, infrastructure, and grid stabilization projects.

And yet...their stock price does hardly anything. Definitely did not benefit from the pump and dump nature other tech stocks have seen in the last 12 months. I just want to understand why?

... you must also acknowledge that higher current valuations imply lower future returns. Assuming no change in expected future cash flows, which is implied by only citing lower rates as justification for current valuations, you are essentially “pulling forward” returns with a higher PV of cash flows (low discount rate). Equity returns boil down to the discount rate being applied to cash flows over time and the delta between expected cash flows and actual cash flows. Therefore, if cash flows are delivered as expected, equity returns will equate to the discount rate that was applied to those cash flows. Of course, if you have a view that future cash flows will outperform expectations, then there is an opportunity to earn above the implied discount rate.

Now, I am not making a case for the market being over/undervalued. I have just heard too many market “experts” use the low interest rate argument for why it’s a good time to be in equities without acknowledging the other side of the coin.",

You make a good point about pulling forward cash flows. A lot of people seem to think that an over-valued market has to end in some kind of burst. That does not have to be the case at all. It could very easily just lead to a period of lower-than-average gains as company earnings grow into the valuations.

ms7r2g,,stocks,post,1618593066,"The market is perfectly healthy, and not about to drop, or have a large correction like everyone suspects (Hear me out)I continue to see people being cautious of the markets, and though the vast majority of you will likely disagree with me, and most likely downvote this, just please read through it before hand.

&#x200B;

The market if looked at from a simple graph looks absurd in comparison to previous years, 20% growth even after a crash! however, if compared to previous years this is not 'super uncommon' and still possible like 2013 for example. From this point on when I say the markets I am really just referring to the SPY, since its a simple and accurate portrayal of the overall market imo.

sure, there are some stocks that obviously may crash, and are most certainly going to be argued about if they will crash or not, for example AMC, GME, etc. however, the overall market could not be healthier at the moment, we are currently coming out of a pandemic, and the largest companies are gaining more and more business as the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being forced to close due to a lack of business, while companies like AMZN and WMT have become evermore profitable in 2020 (while this may not be good overall, looking at it from a strictly stock market performance stance, its great news) due to this separation, and allowing big companies to do better, it makes sense the market is growing at such a rate (though maybe the 7-8% in march/April may call for a slight correction). 

companies like CCL, DAL, AAL, and other covid recovery stocks are also improving as their prospects look better going forward, and consumer spending is going to increase as we leave this pandemic behind us. interest rates are extremely low, allowing companies to further increase their profits, and grow as companies, in not creating crazy overvalued companies (there are obvious exceptions)

I see many people worried about inflation, and showing various graphs that have flaws, such as the M1 graph I believe I saw on the home page here, or maybe on a similar subreddit, hinting that there is far too much money in circulation right now, but that graph has only gone up so much because of the shift from M1 not including savings accounts to now including them.

Furthermore, comparing it to the 2000 bubble is not even fair, the 2000 bubble had seen at least 230% growth in the 5 years leading up, we have only seen around 100%. during the 2000 bubble, nobody thought the market would crash, and continue the increase, during this current market however, things couldn't be more different, everyone is trying to guess what will cause the market crash, you see it all over the news, on CNBC, barrons, and then in all the investing subreddits, trying to predict the next market crash. there are no crappy loans like in 2008, and again, like in 2008 nobody really assumed a crash, and everyone assumed house prices would just increase, however that couldn't be more different today, (with the stock market I mean). 

I believe this has just been an exceptionally good year, and may continue until 2022 or 2023 even, or may slow down soon, and just consolidate, but personally, I don't see a large drop like everyone is suggesting. If you disagree, that's up to you, but for the love of god, please stop putting graphs that don't prove anything about a crash coming, I've seen 3 different graphs posted make trending, trying to indicate a crash is coming, which I believe are unrelated, or are exaggerated.","['WMT', 'DAL', 'AAL', 'AMZN', 'CCL']"

My take is, “value” plays aren’t so value anymore. Ironically, once everyone started rotating out of growth in droves, high quality growth names look to be better value. It’s my opinion that the market is slightly overvalued even considering the economic backdrop, stimulus, and rates.

When one looks at the market today, SP500 is at a PE of around 37, with most tech companies at or above PE of 40. Craziest is Telsa PE is at over 1100, thats like you invest $1100 and company makes $1. 

How do you explain these basic things if market is healthy ?",

ms5tbv,,stocks,post,1618587644,"MGNI reporting Q1 earnings May 10MGNI was a stock I got into into right before Thanksgiving after doing some research on good growth stocks for the first half of 2021. They are a sell-side advertising provider.

Supply/Sell Side Platforms connect advertisers to publishers to ensure advertising inventory is properly filled within the publishers available channels. This is normally used by publishers to gain access to advertisers. This is where MGNI operates.

This compares to Demand Side Platforms that are  is used by advertisers to find publishers.

The goal of these platforms is to ensure that advertising inventory is properly targeted towards the consumers who are viewing publisher channels.

An example of sell side would be an in-house advertising company like Apple who would use MGNI to find proper publishers to target their iPhone ads. An example of demand side would be Roku using TTD to fill commercials between free streamed videos. Before advertising platforms, advertisers and publishers would do direct sales, but this lead to inefficiencies in targeted audiences and scalability.

As stated, MGNI operates on the sell side. They primarily target advertisers and work to find the proper publishers for which the advertiser's ads will find a home. As on their website, one of their clients is Discovery Communications which uses MGNI to properly target ads for their product portfolio.

MGNI makes money by offering proper placement of ads and also tracking of their efficiency. From their 10k filing:
> We provide a full suite of tools for sellers to control their advertising business and protect the consumer viewing experience. These controls are particularly important to CTV sellers who need to ensure a TV-like viewing and advertising experience for consumers.
> Buyers leverage our platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audiences on brand-safe premium inventory, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from thousands of sellers. We believe that our scale, platform features, and omni-channel offering makes us an essential partner for buyers.

MGNI has seen a 150% gain in stock price since November based on positive momentum in their connected TV offering. 2020 was the first year they saw solid CTV growth and its a new revenue stream for them. This has allowed their revenue to increase by almost 50% between 2019 and 2020. CTV makes up 15% of all their revenue, Desktop makes 36% and Mobile makes 49%. All three segments are growing, with CTV being the top growth line. Their revenue in 2020 was $221M.

I believe the stock has rallied based on expected CTV revenue growth in the future. At a stock price of $40, MGNI has a market cap of $4.5Bn. This puts its P/S ratio at about 20. Not too egregious but definitely high. If they can maintain 50% revenue growth YoY, that P/S ratio falls to a much more paltry 13.

Their margins are  currently 66%, which is consistent YoY. The main reason they didn't post a profit in 2020 was due to increased sales/marketing cost, higher administrative cost and what seems to be a one time restructuring cost.

In their Q1 earnings, here's what you should be looking for:

- How close is the stock to $40? $40 seems to be a good place for MGNI leading into May 10. If its above $40, I would trim my position to manage risk. If its below $40, I would increase my position based on risk tolerance. I pick $40 because that sets a P/S ratio of 20, and is the midpoint and support level since the February annual report.

- With the shutdown of 3rd party cookie tracking by browser and endpoints, sell-side advertising tracking has become more critical to have effectively targeted ads. Magnite has been putting out good PR trying to focus on this macro trend.

- Growth of the CTV business. We should see CTV moving towards almost 30% of total revenue.


If we don't see revenues of approximately $80M, with CTV business making up $20M of that revenue, I think that MGNI will see a sell off.


Right now, MGNI is seeing overall downward pressure that's affecting all small/mid cap companies. Its hard to remain convicted when its eating 3% losses every day. If MGNI doesn't find support at $35, its falling all the way to $18 where it found support after the December short attack by Spruce Point Capital.

If earnings show another 50% QoQ or YoY growth rate in revenue, buoyed by strong CTV and 3rd party cookie demand, I could imagine MGNI going to $50 to maintain a P/S ratio of $60. Anything short of that, I see MGNI falling to $20 until next earnings.",['AAPL']

MAXN just priced their offering at $18 a share. That's 6.9M new shares, on a float of 13M and total of 30M. Thats a 23% dilution.

Also, that price point is some real management bullshittery, when MAXN was trading at $33 on April1 after the Biden infrastructure speech, and hit a peak of $52. Its as if the management always knew that MAXN was over valued, and priced the offering in line with their original split from SPWR price.

The revenue of MAXN in 2020 was 844M with a net loss of 144M.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MAXN

Their revenue was down from 2019, but their net loss was lower too, mainly due to lower operating loss.

Their cash position is higher than in 2019, but with declining revenues this isn't really a compelling point.

I think there is also an intangible here. Even though the underlying numbers may look okay, the behaviour of the leadership sets a tone for the future of the company.

Lets start first with the slide. MAXN is an offshoot of SPWR. SPWR announced their earnings in February and they were not great. This caused SPWR, MAXN and ENPH to all slide because all three companies are tied together at the hip.

Since that slide, MAXN has done absolutely nothing to set investor expectations for the upcoming earnings. The stock slid from $52 at its peak down to $19 today when the offering was officially priced.

In that 6 week span, I'm certain that the leadership had known the underlying challenges to the company and its fair market value. Of course all is fair in business, but this behaviour does not give me confidence holding MAXN going forward as the leadership cannot be trusted to take care of their shareholders.

There was also a great post about this yesterday:
https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mrog5u/opinion_on_maxn/guno907/


At this point, I don't believe MAXN will recover from its price point. I actually see MAXN sliding back to $12 before coming back up. It may get back up to $22, but I don't see it return to its $30+ glory days without some major turn around. Their primary installation partner (SPWR) is seeing reduced outlook and revenue on installations. Analysts are downgrading their models for SPWR, and MAXN has just put up numbers to reinforce their bad position.

If you're looking for a solar infrastructure and manufacturing play, I think SEDG is a better bet at this point that is more predictable, reliable and seems to have better management at the helm.

What does everyone think about my reasoning?

MAXN gives the best solar panels as technology. Also they are not a Chinese company which I se it as a big advantage in an green infrastructure world.

I think the solar industry will keep going up just because it's cheaper than everything else and you can install solar panels over other structures (compared to wind). And I see MAXN as a possible big player.",
ms7uxv,,stocks,post,1618593378,"RECAF - Reconnaissance Energy Africa Full DD coming Sunday. But a weekend of hype could build and gap up on Monday.RECAF Reconnaissance Energy Africa. 

Full disclosure, Been buying since $2.75 but I bought more 5000 more shares today at $5.75. So I still feel really good about the PPS. Could be a truly amazing run this year!! 

Taken from article links below...

“The size of the potential upside for Recon Africa, combined with the speed the company is executing its exploration program, means that this is not likely a scenario where investors are forced to wait for a potential payoff five years or more into the future. Positive drilling results could trigger an increase in share value – or potential partnership and acquisition news – at some point in 2021, probably making this a rare short-term opportunity with significant upside potential.”


Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO.V; RECAF) is a small $300 million company that has secured petroleum licenses for an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana...two extremely resource-friendly countries with very low royalties fees.

This basin – as deep as the Permian – could prove to be one of the world's last-ever giant onshore oil discoveries.   And as a new basin, the potential is likely for Conventional Oil and Gas.  No Fracking, normal production profiles, low water requirements which means low cost per barrel. And Recon Africa has secured the petroleum licensing rights to the entire basin.

With one of the world's largest onshore, undeveloped hydrocarbon basins – whose potential has been analyzed and acknowledged by some of the industry's most sought-after experts – the oil that is hoped to be discovered by Recon Africa could ultimately prove to be worth tens of billions.

With drilling now underway, it's unlikely that this company remains under-the-radar for much longer – and the world will be very interested to learn about any major discovery made here.

The Most Exciting New Oil Frontier

Recon Africa (RECO.V; RECAF) owns the rights to a massive sedimentary basin loaded with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas. Under several long-term petroleum licenses, they have acquired all rights to an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana.

The Kavango Basin is comprised of 8.75 million acres and is said to be similar in depth to the Permian. New data on the basin shows that not only is it large – it's also as much as 30,000 feet deep.  The Kavango is a rift-basin, which refers to geologically how the basin formed.  All of the major onshore oil and gas fields in sub-Saharan Africa are contained in rift basins.

The source rocks in the Kavango are believed to be the same age and quality South Africa's 600,000-square-kilometer Karoo sedimentary basin, home to Shell's massive Whitehill Permian gas play. The difference is that the thermal history in South Africa led to much higher heat flow and subsequent over-cooking that lead to only dry gas remaining. This year, armed with new data, noted source rock expert Dan Jarvie has estimated that the basin could be capable of generating 100 billion-plus barrels of oil. 

In November 2020, the highly respected global energy consultants at Wood Mackenzie issued a report proclaiming that the Kavango Basin ""represents one of the largest onshore undeveloped hydrocarbon basins in the world.""

In this report, the experts at Wood Mackenzie identified three basins that provide a useful benchmark as to what the potential for the Kavango Basin might look like...one of which was the US – Midland Basin (Permian) in Texas that has an estimated overall development value of $540 billion.

Experts Are Backing This New Oil Boom

Bill Cathey, President and Chief Geoscientist of Earthfield Technology is known as the ""geological interpreter to the supergiants,"" as he has consulted for every oil and gas major and large independent in the business. Here's what he had to say about the Kavango Basin:

""Not only was the data on the basin some of the best he had ever seen... nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin of this depth that has ever failed to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. ""

And Cathey is not the only expert to have weighed in on the potential for Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO.V; RECAF).

AMC 'Under Attack' From Short Sellers Again, CEO Says
Mentioned:	AMC GME T
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) CEO Adam Aron said that the movie theatre chain is once again 'under attack' from short sellers after having avoided bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

What Happened: In an interview with social-media finance commentator Trey Collins, Aron said that the volume of short sales â?? bets made by traders that AMC Entertainment's stock will fall â?? jumped about 50% to 73.8 million shares in March. Collins offers online investment commentary under the username Trey's Trades.

AMC has said it is seeking shareholder approval to sell 500 million shares. However, Aron reportedly pledged that if shareholders approve the authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued, AMC will not use even one of those shares in the calendar year 2021. Instead, the company will seek to sell those shares in the coming years.

The CEO added that if AMC needed to raise cash in the short term, it already has a prior authorization to sell 43 million shares that will be sufficient to get the company through the pandemic, the report noted.

Aron also praised the meme investors who bid the stock up to more than $20 a share in January this year and fought against 'conventional' market participants such as short sellers, according to the report.

See Also: GameStop, AMC Selling Shares Is A Good Long-Term Move, Says Cramer

Why It Matters: Shares of heavily shorted stocks such as AMC Entertainment and GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) have been popular among retail investors. The stocks have seen extreme volatility this year as retail traders belonging to the Reddit Investor forum r/WallStreetBets bid up the stocks to create a short squeeze. AMC Entertainment's stock has returned year-to-date gains of 366.9%.

AMC struggled amid the pandemic as the closure of theatres forced the company into a cash crunch. The company, which reopened 98% of its locations in March, now expects the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. and the release of blockbuster movie titles in the coming months to boost sales this year.

It was reported in March that AMC is likely getting discounts on film-rental fees from AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE: T) subsidiary WarnerMedia. A discount on film-rental fees, which usually account for a huge share of a theatre chain's costs, could boost AMC's gross margins.

Price Action: AMC Entertainment shares closed almost 5.9% higher on Thursday at $9.90.",
mrnfq3,,stocks,post,1618518707,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik brushed off speculation that channel checks for the social-media company have been relatively muted, saying the concerns were overblown. Pinterest shares fell as as much as 11% Friday, the most since early March, which Shmulik said created a buying opportunity.

The analyst said channel checks for Pinterest are as strong as he has ever heard, acknowledging that they remain challenging, given that significant changes from large ad buyers can have a material impact. Shmulik has a market perform rating on the stock. It has 18 buys, 9 holds and one sell rating, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Today PINS selling volume is almost 3 fold the normal average volume. Is anyone buying today before earning? It seem PINS is currently having the least regulatory issue out of the social media stocks. Also many people use PINS to generate new ideas and there is still many monetization opportunities.",

mrusuc,,stocks,post,1618543353,"Benchmarking performance and the impact of taxesThis is one of those ""lesson's learned"" posts which I'm putting up as a form of catharsis but also the hope that others can learn from my experiences.

The two biggest thing I've learned over the past 4 months of trading:

1. Everyone feels like a trading genius when the entire market is booming

2. Benchmarking performance sets a real world expectation for your actions

For #1, its self explanatory. In February I felt like the whole stock market thing was super easy. Just dump in money, wait for it to double and you're a trading genius. I thought the gravy train would never end, and I thought stocks only go up and stay up. Well, as we all know that is not the case. I got too confident and exuberant, and instead of setting stop losses or price targets or goals, I just let my entire portfolio ride in individual stocks. The market corrected and cratered from February 16 on wards. And to this day, even though VOO and QQQ are back up 10% from their March lows, my portfolio keeps losing money day after day because I didn't manage risk appropriately. Big lesson learned.

The more important thing to share though is how do you measure your performance as a trader/investor, identified in #2. This is very critical because active trading, and even active investing, requires mind share, mental commitment and resources. Additionally, if you're very active in your investing you'll also get hit with tax implications. All this stuff should be considered into the overall performance of your portfolio. Here's my personal experience and journey that I hope folks can learn from.

If I had taken my entire portfolio value on October 30 and just bought VOO with every last dollar, my performance for year to date would be 30% returns. Not bad for a low cost passive index fund.

Instead what I did was buy and sell stocks thinking I could be smarter than the aggregate market. My swing trades got me over confident since the performance of the stocks I was picking was incredible, and my short term holds ended up becoming long term investments because of my over confidence. I didn't have good set out exit points, so I would buy and just wait for the stock to go up. And as long as it was going up I kept holding. At one point, my portfolio was up 90% from October 30th levels, trading at a 60% return over VOO. I thought I was the smartest investor ever. Then February hit, then March hit, the April hit, and now my portfolio is actually trading at 2% below VOO levels. Everything always reverts to the mean. And I don't think the fuckfest is over, as EV and green tech is still undergoing a brutal correction.

The bigger thing to think about is now this: I have a bunch of individual stocks for which I don't have conviction. I never intended to hold them long, but I didn't manage risk appropriately to sell them. And EVEN IF I had sold them at their peak, at 90% gains, the tax man gonna come and clobber me for short term capital gains. That could be as low as 22% or as high as 38%.

So if I had 90% gains, and I got taxed at 24%, then my gains are actually 68%. Still better than VOO, but not as good before. But here is the big rub. Selling those stocks would have been a good move but as they started to correct to the mean, I held them thinking that they would return back to their original levels. I never sold, and I kept holding and holding. And during this entire time, I NEVER COMPARED TO MY BENCHMARK!

What I should have been doing is keeping a mental tally of when my account value would be equivalent to VOO performance with tax implications. And for me that would have occurred when my portfolio was at 45% gains. At 45% gains, I could have liquidated my account, paid the tax man, and been no worst off than if I had put my money into VOO and just held.

Well, I'm well below that at this point. My performance compared to VOO is now at a 2% loss, and even if i liquidate I'll still have the tax man to pay so I'm doing worst off over all. 

All that for the hours I spent researching trends, finding tickers, watching my profile every day. Easily 10 hours a week of work messing with my portfolio. Thats 10 hours a week for almost 5 months that I could have back if I had just bought VOO and forgotten about it.

What has all this taught me? Three big lessons:

1. Depending on your temperament and mental health, passive investing may be way better off than active investing. Also, factor in whether you're good at investing/trading. I realized I am not. I need to practice way more with smaller amounts of money before I make the jump from passive investing into active investing.

2. Finding stocks and buying them is only one piece of the puzzle. Another much more important piece is risk management, exit strategies and stop losses. Unless you are an investor, where you will buy and hold a stock forever, every entry needs to be timed with a mental exit. I failed at this so hard and I need to take a step back to reevaluate why I was so bad at this.

3. Always be benchmarking! Compare your portfolio's performance again S&P500 against 1month, 3 months, 6months and 12months. How are you doing? What decisions are you making that are paying off? Calculate your portfolio's internal Beta! My portfolio's beta was about 3 before the correction. After the correction my portfolio has a beta of -0.5. Thats a really hard pill to digest, but its super important to know how your portfolio moves compared to the market.


To anyone who actually read this wall of text, I hope it provided you some lessons that avoid the mistakes I made. I'm sure people will read this and reply with distasteful messages into this post. The important thing to know about all this is that investing is a long term game and strategy. Having one bad year should be a big learning experiencing. Go back and retest your strategies and learn from them. Take a step back and play with less money. Lean on index funds in the mean time to avoid the crush of inflation. Once you've honed a reliable strategy, then start to increase the amount of money with which you're playing.",['SPGI']
mrusuc,guori22,stocks,comment,1618545720,"The lesson you learned is suspicious similar to one I learned several years ago... VOO saved me these last few weeks. It's about 40% of my portfolio.

I also compare myself to the S&P (and I rarely win btw)... But I wouldn't sell my holdings once I hit the same YTD gains as the S&P because then I might as well just chuck all my funds into VOO and avoid the stress. But I have about 25-30% of my portfolio that I like to play around with riskier plays.

Good news is that I've learned a lot as well. Next time, I will definitely not over leverage into small cap/penny stocks and look out for market recovery/trend reversal instead of just endlessly averaging down on crap....or learn to cut loss when the tide is turning.

I've lost all of my profits the last 4 months+ down 10k of unrealized  losses. And I still have taxes to pay for short term gains.

The other good news is that my retirement is entirely  in index funds (VSTAX)...Even when 'gamblers' told me how much I could be making (haha), I didn't touch my retirement money....so assuming status quo, I can retire in 20-30 years living a simple life.  :)

This comes on the heels of excellent bank earnings for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. thanks to record liquidity and savings.

The question: If I buy a share at 100.
The price drops to 90 so I buy another.

My cost basis is 95, and the stock comes up to 95. 

But I have reason to think it’s going to drop more before coming back up. So I sell my 2 shares at 95 and reinvest when it drops back down.

Is that going to make the first share ($100) considered a wash since I bought back in after the sale? Basically will the 2 share sale be a +$5 realized gain, or will that still be a +/-$0 when it comes tax time?",

mrzrjj,,stocks,post,1618566107,"Discovery Inc. DISCA DD & thoughts*Warning: I'm long shares and leaps of $DISCA so this post could be biased.*

Discovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

From looking at the app store, it seems people are really enjoying the Discovery+ app **4,9/5 stars** which would be a big concern if it wouldn't have a good reputation.

[App store review](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discovery-stream-tv-shows/id1498327873)

I don't see Discovery+ replacing Netflix or being the market leader. What I see is a certain group who do enjoy Discovery to also buy their subscription service.

&#x200B;

Netflix, HBOMax, Apple offer content which is uncomparable quality wise.

Discovery's is often something to just relax and watch, mellow content, background tv and can exist next to the other streaming giants for people wanting more variety.

Yes previous highs do not indicate that it would go back to them, however the rally started with discovery launching their Discovery+ model, you can clearly see that start January price took off and I believe for good reason as Discovery transforming their business model is actually a huge deal if succesful and that's what investors rallied towards. In the long term it all comes down to if Discovery+ would be getting lots of subscribers and create the revenue, market price should follow if they actually generate the $$$.

In February this year Discovery already had 11 million subscribers, exceeding wallstreet expectations, if they can keep this rate up I can see Discovery reaching 20M+ subs soon.

[11 million subscribers](https://www.nexttv.com/news/discovery-claims-vast-majority-of-its-11-million-ott-subscribers-belong-to-discovery-plus#:~:text=Since%20debuting%20%245%2Da%2Dmonth,5.2%20million%20subs%20in%20December)

Disney+ have over 100 million subscribers after 1,5 years.

\- If Discovery were to achieve 50M subs in 1,5 years (June 2023) I believe the company would be on the way to become a challenging streaming company.

As Discovery+ just launched mostly in Januari this year, i expect next earnings call to offer a lot more clarity to see how much there subscription base has grown and in what direction we can see the company moving.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrzrjj,guplfzo,stocks,comment,1618570877,"I bought Discovery at the bottom and that was a mistake imo. Discovery entire bull thesis is reliant on D+ working out. But let's look at what it is about. They charge $5 for a ad lite experience and $7 a ad free experience. Honestly I have 0 expertise in this form of monetization,  but as a user this would turn me away from continuing any subscription. The idea of a paying customer having to pay more to avoid ads just doesn't seem to make sense to me. It would probably turn away people away from it.

But more than anything else the thing that turns me off from Discovery is the programs they have. What do you imagine discovery to be about? Science, nature, education and exploration if the wider world. What is it in reality? 

-90 Day Fiance and spinoffs
-American Monster
-Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations
-Barefoot Contessa
-Chopped
-Deadliest Catch
-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives
-Disappeared
-Fixer Upper
-House Hunters
-Married at First Sight
-Planet Earth 
-The Pioneer Woman
-Property Brothers
-Say Yes to the Dress
-Sister Wives
-Super Soul Sunday

Other than Planet Earth everything else is a strong departure from what Discovery is about. Which of these would you pay $7 a month. Hell which of this would you pay $5 a month for? The shows they have are shows you watch when you got nothing on, not shows you would specifically pay for. In my opinion, unless D+ return to their biggest draw and what they are known for, I will steer clear.

mrftxt,gumspxx,stocks,comment,1618510963,"Ok, here is the thing. The stocks you have been buying looks like you scanned through the top posts of /r/wallstreetbets and bought those companies. This, in general, is a very risky plan. Especially buying companies in highly speculative industries like cannabis or EVs. 

Now, if you really believe in those companies, a 25% loss over 2 months shouldn't faze you. Two months is basically no time at all. Stop looking at investing as a month by month endeavor and start thinking years in the future. If you think these are good companies, you should be looking to hold them for multiple years. If you believe in these companies, and hold them, it is possible that you see them gain back your losses. 

If you don't believe in these companies, you should sell, eat your losses and move on to things you believe in.

There are a lot of comments suggesting buying AAPL, AMZN, or MSFT. However, you must realize that there is no individual stock that is 'safe'. Some are 'safer' than others, but ALL individual stocks have substantial risks. Even the bluest of blue chip companies can falter. Do I think it is likely for AAPL or MSFT to stay flat or lose value over the next few years? No, I don't believe that is likely. However, what if the newest iPhone is a flop? What if Azure is the victim of a serious security breach?

Buying ETFs is less risky, but still involves risk. Especially if those ETFs specialize in a specific sector. But, in general, they are less risky than individual stocks because ETFs generally hold many, many individual stocks and the performance of a single company is weighted far less as a total of your investment .

If you are looking for the safest investment, put your money in a high yield savings account. The next safest option is probably long term government bonds. The next safest option is highly diversified ETFs. ETFs like VTI, SPY, VOO, etc, are not devoid of risk, but will generally track the performance of market, are relatively stable, and generally go up over the long term.

If you are happy with market returns, putting all your money into VTI is a good, 'safe', plan. If you want to beat the market, then you'll need to invest in specific sectors or companies that you believe will do better than the market. However, anytime you 'tilt' your portfolio away from the market, you will either under or over preform the overall market. But, keep in mind, that on average, people cannot beat the market over the long term.","['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"

I want to put $300 I've managed to save up into my IRA before I inadvertently spend it. I've always enjoyed tracking the market but haven't done so for years due to just being busy with regular work, however this recent market craziness is pulling me back in. 

I've been eyeing two companies specifically, Microsoft (MSFT) and Insulet (PODD). I like Microsoft because of their recent efforts at diversifying their income streams and investments and I became familiar with Insulet from a previous employer and I like their insulin pump equipment and approach. 

The thing is an individual share of either of these companies would take up a substantial portion of the $300. Should I take the risk and go in on one share of one company? Or search for a lower cost per share ETF that has relatively good exposure to these companies like EDOC for Insulet?

I know it's a small amount compared to how much others trade but I'm looking at this as a starting point for how I'll approach my investments moving forward so it's a big decision for me. Try stock picking and chase higher gains? Or try to diversify for some security?

For context, I'm in my 30's so retirement is far away and have reasonably good risk tolerance as the IRA is a buy and hold account. However I've been burned many many times by my stock picking activities and have lost some self confidence.

I'm curious about the valuation of DKNG. In my opinion it is poised to be much more valuable than it is currently worth. It has partnerships with UFC, WWE, a bunch of NBA teams, ESPN, Caesars Entertainment group and more.\[2\]

They are becoming basically Athlead (Office Reference) with hiring Cal Ripkin Jr and Michael Jordan as advisors among other athletes. They are the forefront of sports gambling in the United States yet they are falling while other stocks are rising.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]

At one point they were poised to merge with Fanduel but were blocked by the FCC because it would have created a 90% monopoly in online sports betting.\[4\]

It's 50 day average is rising and it hit a high about a week ago \[5\] but I still believe the price point is higher than $70 even.

With sports coming back, working people with disposable who are more technology savvy because of this pandemic and the partnerships with almost everyone, I think DraftKing has the potential to be in every sports betters hand.

If there's anything in the way, it's competition obviously but also laws that need to change to get them into more states. So, I think I'm long on DKNG as I can't imagine them going on a downward trend for any reason. Gambling and sports have been best friends forever and they are one of the leaders of introducing it to the internet.

P.S. - I am a noob at stocks and investing research. I am giving my best effort as some sort of DD to learn more myself and I know I likely looked over a lot of key points. Thanks for reading.

mrmuc3,gundrqz,stocks,comment,1618520081,"I do think DKNG is aggressively priced but I absolutely think it's warranted and I'm really high on the future of it and this industry in general.

I was reading that the estimated betting handle on the sports betting market between legal and illegal bets in the US was somewhere around $250B. Books make about 6-8% of the handle so that makes sports betting roughly a $15-20B industry in its current structure for revenue. Mix in Canada once they approve single game wagering and the growth from exposure and having betting widely available and I would not be shocked if that number doubles if not even more once legal widespread betting is available.

Also I love the groundwork that DKNG has laid, earnings has been mostly held back by advertising and promotional costs but it's clearly paying off. DKNG has heavy market shares in a lot of newly expanded states. Mix that in with the NFL Deal, talks for a deal with Action Network, and all the other deals you referenced, it's a no brainer to me.  I believe will ultimately end up being the #1 Sportsbook in the US with FanDuel being a close second and other books like Barstool and MGM being formidable and getting their share.

I came into investing into this industry with a blank slate in terms of who I wanted to commit my money to and just firmly believing this industry was going to be huge. DKNG has impressed me more than everybody else thus far and by a pretty good margin

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention the Dish deal. I think the next big jumps for this industry are venue sports betting and integrating live betting into viewing experiences (like what I believe Fubo is starting to work towards). DraftKings is potentially getting to the forefront of the latter with the deal with Dish.","['MGM', 'DISH']"

mrohbw,,stocks,post,1618521795,"LL Flooring a Potential Multi-Bagger and Here's Why (X Post ValueInvesting)LL Flooring ticker symbol LL

It's hard to find a multi-bagger stock in the days of high valuations. Especially when inflation has traditionally been linked to lower P/E in the stock market’s history. Three important features for a multi-bagger is a stock that has good growth potential, a low P/E, and good leadership. I believe that LL has all of those qualities. A few years back the company was entangled in two lawsuits. One involving formaldehyde at higher than acceptable levels and another for not sourcing their lumber in accordance with law. As a consequence, the cash flows were heavily decreased, and investor sentiment was massively damaged. Consequently, the current P/E is sitting at about 12. I will address in greater detail each of these three drivers now.

**Leadership:**

Right after the legal entanglements, the CEO of the company was fired and the company hired CEO Charles Tyson. Charles Tyson has worked with a lot of supply chains including Advance Autoparts, OfficMax, and Officedepot. Since taking the position, he has focused on rebranding the company and increasing online sales and is trying to increase their market sales to pros.

**P/E:**

Interestingly, although cash flows took a hit in 2019 and 2018 due to legal battles and therefore the earnings decreased, the revenue stayed consistent. In 2019, their free cash flow was -20M and in 2020 it was 141M! I view their legal troubles as a chapter that has passed in the company’s history, but still has damaged their P/E as compared to their historical valuations. For example, FND, the closest market competitor, has a P/E of 57!

**Growth:**

As everyone is aware, 2021 is going to be a blow out year for housing. Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that interest rates will be kept low throughout the year, the Biden administration is looking for more infrastructure spending, and housing costs are all strong tailwinds for new housing starts. Moreover, one of the most common things people want done in a newly purchased home is the flooring redone. Lastly, hard flooring is expected to grow as carpeting shrinks as total market share. This company’s gross profit has grown for several years in a row, and it would be almost inconceivable that it won’t grow in 2021 and onward.

Additionally, LL has increased their digital presence with the release of a new app that allows people to virtually install flooring in their home by taking a picture of their current floors. I would recommend anyone to try the app out for free. It works incredibly well! I see these as great headwinds for growth of the company.

I can’t help but feel incredibly confident in earnings of the company this year, even in the short term. Year over year earnings will be incredible. Q1 of 2020 was a terrible quarter. Historically they have always outperformed in Q1 vs the prior year’s Q4, but Q1 2020 was the shutdown quarter. As all indicators point to an incredible quarter, Q1 2021 will displace last year’s Q1 and dramatically shift the P/E even lower. Naturally, I see this as an even more enticing scenario as more people will want to buy the stock.

For full disclosure, I love the stock, I own the stock, I will continue to invest in the stock, and I am not a financial advisor and you shouldn’t think I am providing financial advice. I'm looking forward to anyone's comments on the company.",

Any opinion is appreciated",
mrog5u,guno907,stocks,comment,1618524888,"I’m going to lay out the bull case here:

1. Solar is a cheaper source of power than natural gas, and will dominate new installations over the next few years.
2. MAXN crushed EPS
3. MAXN generated >$844 million in revenue in 2020, which is currently larger than its market cap ($780 million). Though sales are down from 2019 due to COVID (also note it was the same company as SPWR in 2019, it has recently split off from it)
4. MAXN panels are considered the most efficient panels produced today

The bear case:

1. All solar is overvalued
2. Q1 guidance is poor, and they know a lot about Q1
3. 16% dilution of shares

The 16% is the most tangible to me, since MAXN undersells itself on guidance all the time. The question is what is the price point that 16% comes from. Is it $30 a share? $28? $24? These are all share prices from the past two weeks.

For solar in general, I can't help but notice the price action is similar to highly speculative hydrogen stocks that aren't profitable yet. Perhaps all solar is overvalued, but I think it's more likely they are in the same basket as far less secure companies. The also all have very high short floats (\~25% or so).",

mrraw5,,stocks,post,1618531029,"What bond yields tell us about the state of the economy.\[**Disclaimer:** I'm new to this but do have a small background in economics.  I posted this as a comment to another user in the daily thread, but since I put some effort into it and think it's a valuable write-up, I decided to make a thread.  If anything is off, please go ahead and correct me.  I do believe that the bulk of what I'm saying is accurate.\]

&#x200B;

My understanding is that rates (bond yields) go up when the economy is in good shape. That's because people are more confident in equities and they sell off bonds (less demand = lower prices = higher yields).

When the economy is in bad shape, people go back to bonds because they're a safer alternative to stocks. People don't trust in the stock market's ability to perform and flock to bonds to give them fixed income and a safer place to park their capital. More demand for bonds = higher bond prices = lower yields.

Short answer for why bond yields and prices are inversely correlated: say you have a bond that's worth $1000 face value and has a 2% yield.  If demand for bonds has gone down and you must now sell that bond on the secondary market for, say, $800, then the yield has increased.  Why?  Because the buyer is paying less money for the same fixed return.  Less money for the same fixed return = higher overall yield.  And vice versa.  I encourage everyone to look this up if you're not clear on it.

Apart from that, right now is a weird time. Bond rates went up recently, and people were saying that was a *bad* sign for the markets. That's because people were saying it was related to inflation. Imagine: if inflation is going up, bonds with their current 1-2% yields (and negative real yields) are a horrible place to park your cash. You're actually losing money already due to negative real yields, but if inflation spikes 1-3% you're actually losing even more. Remember, bond yields are fixed so inflation eats into their nominal (fixed) yields.

The theory was that economic stimulus plus dovish Fed policy (low interest rates, easy money) made people fearful that inflation was just around the corner. Thus, they began to sell off their bonds. Remember, less demand for bonds = lower prices = higher yields. If this were indeed the motivation for the bond sell-off, it's actually a *negative* indicator for the economy. It means we expect inflation to come. It means the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to contain inflation (more expensive to borrow money). It means that future earnings will be worth less (value of dollars in the future goes down). This is why tech stocks sank at the same time bond yields went up: A. because they depend on easy capital (low interest rates) to expand their operations, and B. their valuation at the moment is highly linked to their future earnings.

However, Jay Powell and the Fed came out and said any inflation would just be transitory, and the market seemed to believe it. The bond sell-off was contained. Furthermore, analysts were saying, like I said in the first half of my post, that rising bond yields is actually positive for the economy.

So basically the fears about inflation got buried and we're back to a ""normal"" scenario where rising bond yields are seen as a positive sign for the markets.

I'm not sure why bond yields went down today, but a quick Google search said that higher yields have attracted some investors (including overseas investors) back in.

I'm new to this but it was good for me to make sure I understand it and try to explain it. Anyone who reads this can feel free to correct anything that is wrong.",['GOOGL']

mrraw5,gupn2um,stocks,comment,1618572098,"I think that bond yields went down yesterday due to large purchases. The simple relationship between yields and economic recovery doesn't make sense because job and retail data released yesterday was fantastic. Perhaps buyers allocated profits from other investments into bonds, yesterday. The fed is still buying back treasuries and suppressing yields. I am of the opinion that we will not get any meaningful inflation without a significant policy change that increases the income if the bottom 50% of people in the USA whether that is with UBI, increase in minimum wage, or a comprehensive economic overhaul. I don't see that happening, given how divided the USA congress is. Several democrats shot down $15 minimum wage and too few support UBI to pass, despite that it was started under the Republican administration. If the 10yr hits 1.85 and none of the above occur to increase wages, then I'm going to start buying T bonds. Price will go up as yields go back down.  This happened in 2019...job growth was incredible, record unemployment but too many jobs in service industry, and the 10yr was going down.",

Many investors will probably be approaching the 3D printing company's report with cautious optimism. The company's performance last year was a mixed bag relative to Wall Street's quarterly revenue and earnings estimates. Its performance improved notably in the second half of last year, which helped to drive up the stock price.

In 2020, 3D Systems faced challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, as did most companies that have large customer bases in the industrial sector. Pandemic-related tailwinds in the company's industrial segment will likely continue into 2021. 

Investors should be prepared for volatility. 3D Systems stock often makes big moves up or down following the company's release of quarterly results. As to the stock, in 2021, it's up 119% through April 13. The S&P 500 has returned 10.7% over this period.

Some highlights:

The company had previously forecast spending of as much as $28 billion.** Sales in the June quarter may reach $13.2 billion, beating the average $12.8 billion seen by analysts, while full-year revenue may climb 20% in dollar terms, ahead of the “mid-teens” growth predicted in January.

No, there is no guarantee like delta, if the underlying company makes this much $, the stock price will move by x amount too

A company can do really well, and if there is no demand, the stock price never moves up.

So I don’t really get it.

That’s like if a group of 100 people bought/sold rocks to each other based on what they felt/thought about some rocks. The rocks (shares) are pretty useless though.

We are all just **trading** with each other, and giving shares value. If we all decided no, I don’t want to give this share value, there would be no stock market.

maybe like a giant MLM? Where we want others to pay more than we paid for something but we have an endless supply of people, as long as every generation does it.

mr512k,gukd4y6,stocks,comment,1618455976,"Wow literally no one gave you the answer: the answer is actually very simple and it's called *dividends*

When a company pays dividends, it basically pays you for holding their stock. Theoretically, people buy and sell stocks depending on how much dividends they believe the company will be able to pay on the future. High earning companies tend not only to pay high dividends but also to increase them with time.

Take Tesla for example. Right now they're basically reinvesting most of their cash back into the company in order to grow it. But what happens when the company achieves all it's goals and starts printing more money than they can reinvest in growing themselves? Well, they can start giving the owners (i.e. the stock holders) a quarterly bonus out of the piles of cash they're making.

When someone buys a Tesla stock for 750$, what they're basically speculating about is: will Tesla be able to give me a good quarterly payment higher than the risk-free money or low risk money I can make buying less speculative assets like bonds.

Will Tesla make enough money to, let's say, pay an annualized 2%-4% on their stock in 10-15 years? Only time will tell. But if you don't believe they will be able to afford that then yes, you're just speculating and betting of you're willing to pay those prices.",['TSLA']
mr512k,guk9c14,stocks,comment,1618453891,"> A company can do really well, and if there is no demand, the stock price never moves up.


Not really. If investors were too stupid to ever buy a really profitable company, they would offer a dividend and at some point this dividend would be too good to pass up. For example, Microsoft is currently able to pay out 2.24 for every shares thanks to their profits. If investors became dumb and all sold their shares, at some point this 2.24 would become ridiculously good. Let's say if it became 5x cheaper.... you would make 2.24 for a 50$ share on a company that just keeps growing every years lol",['MSFT']
mr512k,guktbw7,stocks,comment,1618467248,"you guys have already given great and concise answers about dividends being the incentive to own particular stocks. 

But I wanted to discuss also the perception of a company's value. 

Stock is part ownership of a company. So in a sense it's far more productive than a shining piece of gold will ever be. 

Someone once said that the stock market is a chart of rich people's feelings, and I don't necessarily disagree. But if the poor and the middle class realize that owning a few shares of a great company (which is the same as owning a part of that company itself) is better than saving money in a bank (because money doesn't produce any goods; businesses do), then the stock market would be a chart of everyone's feelings. And if traders decided to buy or sell stock based on business fundamentals rather than momentary fads or trends, then the chart would more accurately reflect the health and productivity of the market's businesses as a whole.  

The reason why certain stocks soar and others plateau or fall, is due to the free market's constant assessment of a company's health and productivity in relation to its competitors. 

Taken day-to-day, the movement of the stock market is subject to human whimsy and caprice. 

Taken year-to-year, the patterns become distinct. The market trends, the historical and technological and consumerist trends, become quite clear. A company's innovations and market share gains correspond to (but do not cause) price increases.",

mrmo38,,stocks,post,1618516480,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU) Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too:

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly.

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties.

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID.

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high.

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return.

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround.

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again.

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world.

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

mrht3l,gun9fok,stocks,comment,1618518209,"Some general advice that I try to employ as part of my own investment process:

- The old adage that ""if you get the buying right, you don't need to worry about the selling"" has a lot going for it: whenever possible, I invest in companies that I ideally want to hold ""forever""
- I generally don't sell to ""take a profit"", I only sell when I need money for a better investment and when I do, I sell my worst investment / lowest conviction idea first (not the one with the largest gain or loss or anything like that)
- I avoid making investment decisions primarily based on tax considerations (this has never worked out well for me in the end)

In your case, I see the first two points in slight contradiction. IMHO (and I really hate to give you direct advice, but I will anyway), you own businesses that are not good long-term businesses even in good times. Some specific comments:

- DAL: the stock was *much* lower than it is now in 2016 after the Brexit scare of UK/US business travel impact. Doesn't that seem ridiculous compared to what state the whole industry is in now? It's a cyclical trade that could work out for a bit longer, but in the long run, this would be a poor business to own *even* if it wasn't drastically impaired by all the debt, dilution and labor etc. issues that will be coming when things finally (who knows when) return to normal for the airlines.

- BA: see above. The best bull case for this cyclical that I hear is that ""the government won't let them go bankrupt"". I'd personally rather own businesses where avoiding bankruptcy is not the primary concern...

- XOM: read some critical analysis on their ability to continue dividend coverage and debt service. You also own CVX (which is much better positioned) and CVX will benefit from recovery in oil prices and E&P when that finally comes (I believe it will).

To summarize: go over the businesses that you own, do the DD, figure which for you are businesses you want to be a long-term ""part owner"" of and which were just trades and then ""close out"" the trades. When you own a high quality compounder, ""nobody ever went broke taking a profit"" is stupid advice - but here it might apply.","['BA', 'XOM', 'DAL', 'CVX']"

mqyv3r,,stocks,post,1618430876,"How to bounce back after losing so much?Hey guys, don’t know if this is the right sub for this but I need some advice. 

I am currently 21 years old, and started investing during the crash last year. I slowly grew my portfolio to around 8,000$ and had $1000 cash saved up. I had a strategy of dividend stock investing with some growth stocks in there. 

Fast foward to Jan 2021 and I was addicted to the stockmarket. My friend told me to learn about options and debit spreads and all that good stuff. I started making a ton of money with options (because of state of the market before mid-febuary). I grew my portfolio to around 15,000. I had no guidance I was just learning as I went. 

Well, since I did not realize the downside of options, I was heavily leveraged in options so my portfolio over the last month has basically evaporated. Im down to 4,000 dollars now, and I know I should just construct a good portfolio with risk taken into consideration, but at this point, I feel so set back that I am discouraged to just live my life with some safe stocks and continue to add money over time. 

Basically, every time I think about the money I’ve lost it makes me discouraged in investing in big cap stocks that will make me 5-20% because I will still be far behind compared to where I was before. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the money I’ve lost and wished I had someone to tell me to take some profits when I was doing so well. I did learn a lot from losing all this money, but I have so little now that I feel like it doesn’t even matter. 

Also I know the amount of money is peanuts to many, but I am just a college student and wanted to use the money I made in the market to invest in real estate, and now I feel like that goal is 10x farther than it was in Feb.

My advice is advice I need to take myself. Only make options trades you are okay with going to 0. Because they do it a lot.

Also - money is just money. You can always make more later. Don’t let losses ruin your mental health or personal wellbeing.

However, on these boards, I often see some very antagonistic negative comments. I like negative takes- as we've all seen, cult-like positivity can be disastrous. But some of these folks just seem to show up and be gross trolls. I just can't figure out why. If you don't like a stock, why go on its board? Why tweet weird bear gifs? etc

I'm not very conspiracy minded and have always been pretty skeptical about ""hedge fund manipulation"" (I'm sure it happens sometimes, I def think what happened with RH was sketch, but they're just business dudes trying to make money not supervillains). But sometimes I read some of these things and I can't figure out why people take time and energy to trash seemingly random stocks.

You can trade in large quantities in lower dollar amounts so it's more accessible for investors. The way I see it happen is someone with a large following via social media, blogs, even reddit will buy a bunch of a penny stock then make posts touting it to a wide audience. Even if you get a handful of people to buy this will push the price up. Then the original buyer sells out their position for a tidy profit while everyone else hangs on to the penny stock. I think this happens every day as I see it regularly in people touting their success as a penny stock day trader.

As you’d expect, most of my holdings are large cap tech stocks. I tend to rely on ETFs for diversity to add in small/mid-cap as well as specific regions and/or industries. 

Recently, I decided to take a stab at picking individual small cap stocks as they WERE on fire. Have been following Jonah Lupton from Lupton Capital on Twitter and subscribe to his substack. I like the DD he does and provides pretty solid write-ups. I do my own DD on the companies he writes up and ultimately have invested in 3-4 companies I learned about from him. Needless to say, this all started prior to the recent sell-off in small caps. 

I was wondering if anyone here has any nuggets to share on small cap investing, whether sources for ideas, research, etc. Jonah’s stuff is good, but he focuses his attention on a few specific industries and looking to add more sources.

mrktim,,stocks,post,1618511238,"Why I'm bullish on APD, long DD I've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it. I wrote a DD on it not too long ago, but I wanted to add more, since I’ve learnt more. I’m going to apologise in advance, considering how messy this is. I’ve been adding notes to it as I go along. Obligatory: I'm not your financial advisor. I suggest, and encourage you to do your own DD on APD. I love the stock, but that doesn't mean you necessarily should

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV, in that hydrogen production will be far more lucrative. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015 and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future; the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. With this in mind, let's continue.

First, I want to talk purely speculative, this has no impact on the DD below, but I think it gives some good insight into the possibility’s hydrogen has to offer. People think we need to move to EV cars to lower carbon dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but they forget other forms of transportation. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, to reduce their emissions and become carbon free would require a move to either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. This is not an issue that will affect planes, it will also affect ships, and other forms of travel that require significant amounts of energy. Research has already begun into this, with Airbus having announced plans for 3 different hydrogen-fuelled concepts, with the aim of developing zero-emission aircraft that could enter commercial service by 2035. As for ships, it was estimated that by 2020 emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from ships will exceed land-based emissions in Europe. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

What are the current demands for hydrogen? Well, some key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment. 

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio of 33. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (I'm not too informed on these, but here's what wikipedia has to say for those interested: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.). 50% of $1.6 billion in backlog of equipment orders is expected to be recognised in revenue during 2021.

An important question is why I think they’re favourable, over the likes of Linde? Well, with APD being the largest supplier of Hydrogen, any green initiatives are extremely favourable towards them. Looking at financials, the net income of Linde isn’t far beyond that of APD, despite pulling in revenues of $27 billion. Considering that Linde has 2 principle business areas to manage, I feel like this lack of income may stunt their future growth, at least in the near-term.  

I was able to find some information on production numbers, so I said I’d add them here, so you can get an idea as to where they specialise. Overall, regional industrial gases sales constituted 94% of consolidated sales. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47% of consolidated sales, while sales of Hydrogen, Syngas, and related products constituted approximately 22% of sales. Sales of equipment constituted 6% of consolidated sales. 

TLDR: I think this is severely undervalued. They are profitable now, but they have far more room to grow, and will definitely grow, thanks to the demand for atmospheric gases alone from the pharmaceutical sector, and the growing manufacturing industry in the developing economies of Asia Pacific. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow a lot over the coming years. The more I read into the industrial gases sector, the more profitability I see. I think any investment into any industrial gas producer is probably a good bet. There is some clear focus on the future of Hydrogen, but as you can see from production numbers, they are certainly not reliant on hydrogen sales. I think they’re perfectly equipped to continue to increase their price, and I think they’re even slightly undervalued IMO. I don’t think this is a “Get rich quick” investment, but I do think that it is one of them stocks you will wish you had bought into in 5 years time.",['APD']

Go back and find some secondary stock offerings, then go to the SEC website and see the exact time the filing took place. Next go to a chart for the ticker including after hours.

I did that a couple days ago, within 5 minutes of SEC filing the stocks went DOWN. Secondary offerings are a sign of garbage company 99/100 times unless you're tesla I guess.

mqzvok,,stocks,post,1618433903,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 14, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

mrqsao,,stocks,post,1618529213,"Five Star Senior Livimg (FVE) good value stockFive Star Senior Living (FVE) Bought 56 shares at $5.53 on April 12,2021

I have a friend, named Lexi, who once (when she was young), worked at an elderly care facility.  She saw a dead woman in her bathroom and did well upon seeing it.  She no longer fears death.  I, in looking for value, found something that she may like:  Five Star Senior Living is a great place to look for value. 

The company is worth, as of April 15th, 2021, $182.03 million.  Let us see if the company is worth that much. There are 255 senior living communities in the company housing 21,000 residents.  117.4 million Americans (according to an AARP article) are over the age of 50, 35 percent of the nation’s population. The fastest growing population in the United States is over-85.  The second fastest is over-100.  Last time I checked, older people means more need for assisted living places and elderly care centers. Only 77.2 percent of these centers are occupied, with Minnesota being the lowest at 53.9 percent.  So the more occupied by Senior citizens, the more money the company can make. 
With lesser occupancy and the onset of COVID-19, the company has less revenue ($77 million in 2020 vs. $1.6 billion in 2019. However, net loss is less ($7.589 million in 2020 vs. $19.995 million in 2019).  I look at book value and free-cash-flow over income at this point in my life because COVID-19 has knocked off profits for many companies. 
The company has very little debt (only five percent of equity).  FVE has $210 million in equity. FVE has over $50 million in free-cash-flow.  Remember, the company has little debt and does not post a dividend; so the company could reinvest their money into expanding their business. The company trades below book value and has $84.53 million in cash.  In the event of loss or expansion, FVE could use the money to expand.  With a quick ration of 1.5, even if the inventory was factored out, the company has immediate liquidity.  Finally, the company is trading at 46 percent below its’ 52-week high. If the company trades at just ten time’s its’ free-cash-flow; and if the company increases based on that figure, the intrinsic value of the company is triple what it is currently. 

In short, I like this company",

mrhrgv,,investing,post,1618502557,"Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

As a part of a larger trend, MS looks to be undergoing a transformation, achieving most of their revenues through trading, asset/wealth management, and fees and commissions rather than investment banking and interest revenues.

Here are the key figures:

Earnings: $1.70 a share, 68% higher than a year earlier, according to Refinitiv

Revenue: $14.1 billion, 49% higher than a year earlier

mru1gk,,investing,post,1618540606,"There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock marketHedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

mru1gk,gupyaot,investing,comment,1618578868,"I was having a discussion with some friends about this stock yesterday. The mailing address is the residence of one of the corporate officers. It's a small suburban home in a residential neighhborhood.

From the S-1/a - it looks like the deli closed due to covid and my guess is that in an effort to stay afloat, they did a private offer of 2.5M shares at $1/share. On 12/30/2020 - they estimated to have 60 shareholders.

They went public presumably to add liquidity.

The stock trades only about 500 shares per day.

This stock is a great example of retail investors that do zero basic research and simply jump into a position based on only on hearsay.

\[edit\] - I would hesitate to call this a scam - it looks like it was a struggling deli and they needed to raise funds. Instead of taking a loan - they went to the capital markets to sell equity. The S1/A looks pretty realistic. And the risks are pretty clear.

\[edit\] - the ownership structure is kinda interesting. The two people that run the company that presumably owned the deli are local teachers in the public school in that town. It looks like they engaged with some guy - Peter Coker, Jr (some guy in North Carolina) who probably is the one that orchestrated this. Mr. Coker is listed as chairman and he bought a lot of the shares a few thousand bucks. But he's provided loans back to the company. And he has setup some off-shore shell companies in Macau and Hong Kong which owns a lot of the shares as well.",

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['DE', 'TSLA']"

Someone contacted them and was told they capture 95% of extracted materials which isn't bad but it's on par with the smelting that Redwood Materials does. ABML is close to establishing their pilot plant but they already have a closed loop system that extracts 99%+ of materials. It's also a proven and BASF award winner / established partnership (they continue to use their Facilities in the US). 

Make no mistake I think you can't go wrong with investing a small portion into either stock. Both are highly speculative but that's what you get with an industry that's in it's infancy and penny stock / SPACs. I love these as a shovel play.

mrow7p,gunvqlb,investing,comment,1618528650,"Keep in mind this is highly anecdotal because it's just my opinion as a pharma chemist for over 10 years now, I've worked for a couple start-ups, a couple global top 5 corporations, and a few others like generics.

I don't think the problem is our production capabilities. It's really not too difficult for me to find a job, even in a lot of rural areas. If the government really wanted to they could use the defense production act to pump out assloads of covid vaccines. The problem lies in how the industry works these days.

The big boys - Pfizer, Merck, Bayer... - don't really do much true R&D anymore, it's a better business model for them to let the small fries do that and then just buy them. They have production capabilities but they're relatively limited because they're focused on high volume of specific formulations. As far as markets go, this is the glamorous biotech/pharma wealth and risk everyone is familiar with.

But there's a middle group too, and it's huge. There are thousands of mid-sized pharma companies that usually produce either generics or less profitable out-of-patent pharmaceuticals that are anything but glamorous. This is where America's production ability lies, but the problems with tapping it all stem from the corporate... ecosystem, I guess.

The big boys have the most cutting edge patents (and if they don't they buy them, like Pfizer did with BioNTech), so getting them to share with a handful or more mid-sized companies is difficult. But if you manage that the next issue arises in the meeting of two very different worlds; big pharma and still-tiny-but-not-startup-tiny pharma. It's been going very smoothly so far though, the only problem we've seen was with the Baltimore company making J&J's vaccine.

So to try and relate this to the stock market..... I guess Biden could incentivize big pharma to share important patents with mid-sized companies? Invest in Regeneron?

Maybe there's an etf that focuses on not just mid cap, but mid-range production (volume) companies but other than that I don't see a greater than average profit without getting lucky on a stock.","['MRK', 'UPS', 'PFE']"

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well.","['AAPL', 'PYPL', 'TSLA']"

On their first earnings call, they announced the Hyundai deal was dead, they were transitioning to developing IP for their own products (ie engineering services is dead), and that their subscription model wasn't actually financially viable.  And their CFO left.  One analyst asked if their CEO was still employed in the Q&A (lol).

Lordstown got caught juicing pre-orders.  BREAKING:  Steve Burns is still a hack.  This one shouldn't have surprised anyone...

Multiplan gave projections out to 2025 in the first half of 2020, before they merged.  As a public company, they gave no guidance for 2021 in their Q4 earnings call.

mrmmk1,,investing,post,1618516360,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world. 

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

mrmmk1,gun9r67,investing,comment,1618518345,"Thanks for your detailed analysis of this company. I am on the other side of your trade and appreciate a good opposition. 

I think you are oversimplifying the demand component of this business. The managed care business was destroyed last year but the occupancy numbers are slowly ticking back up and will be back to normalized levels by next year. People don’t go to these facilities because they want to so the real issue was the quarantine and the lack of normal demand in the system. 

On the financial side of the equation, I think your operating revenue assumptions are also off. They got rid of the worst properties last year and most of the debt that you highlighted is long-term mortgage debt on the real estate. 

I am absolutely aware that they have some work to do but at an $85m market cap today they are easily worth 5x if they can get back on track. This is not guaranteed for sure but a great risk reward from the current price. 

Technically the chart is also disagreeing with you. Good luck in your trading (except this one).",

mrmmk1,gunvtnu,investing,comment,1618528694,"Hi, I always appreciate somebody really sharing an idea completely like this, so thanks. I have a few thoughts on this one:+ pre-covid, I was looking for long term plays in senior housing so I remember this company. I didn't think it looked like a turnaround was coming up soon and passed it by.+ having a ridiculous rally recently doesn't mean anything on its own for any stock. It just got back to it's pre-crash levels. Since it was headed down pre-crash, maybe that does make for a good short entry, but I'd still thinking of it has having come DOWN to the low 40s.- I think your thesis about the loss of old folks is unlikely to hold up. Sure, we lost a bunch of them, but there were already too many.  People are on waiting lists for years, even decades, to get into senior housing. And, we all know that housing in general has a serious supply problem that isn't going away soon.- I guess I'd say compare its fundamentals to peers and base things on that, but also no reason to start a short against short-term momentum either, so now doesn't seem like the time.",
mrrshn,,investing,post,1618532704,"The Long Bond and US High YieldUsing data sourced from FRED (Federal Reserve’s Economic Data), there have been a total of 20 weeks out of 1,263 weeks (ending Wednesday, averaged) in which the US high yield (BAMLH0A0HYM2EY) less the 30-year US treasury yield (DGS30) has been 2% or below.

mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

Curious to open the discussion and hear your guy's opinion / bear / bull cases.

mrepwx,guny7b8,investing,comment,1618529894,"I think DISCA might be or in the near future be undervalued due to the dump and shorts. If you're willing to hold out then it could make you some money assuming it progresses normally.

My problem with DISCA lies in a few issues:

1. I think streaming will keep growing, but likely to see downturn post-covid.

2. Restriction of content and no benefit from reopening due to it lacking a movie studio or movie production line. T has Warner. NFLX is buying up studios left and right and recently started winning awards. VIAC has Paramount. Amazon has it's in house studio and can literally buy a studio if it wanted. 

3. It would be incorrect to assume that DISCA's previous highs are a guarantee of future highs or even return to those highs. It (along with VIAC) was runned up and pump by Archegos.

4. DISCA doesn't have other business arms to keep it fighting if the streaming war continues into a battle of attrition or if a sudden price-cutting war breaks out. T brings in tons of money from mobile, internet/phone lines, trad TV, and WarnerMedia that does movies. AMZN is a company that will be around for 100 years and it's making money on everything. NFLX is the incumbent and investors gives it the benefit of the doubt as a tech company and will keep buying even if it loses money every year (unlike DISCA). VIAC has a movie studio and a host of news outlets. DIS has a multiple media empire, MCU owns the movies, has theme parks, owns HULU, and sells toys to kids. Alphabet's youtube is already cash positive and will never go away. Comcast is like T and does telecommunications, movies, and news.

5. All these companies can package their stuff with other things. I get HBOMax free with my internet from T. I've been getting NFLX for $2/month with my T-mobile plan for years now. NFLX is the most popular subscription packaged with other subscriptions that people already use. AMEX Gold and higher cards get it for free. DIS+ is the 2nd most population ""added"" free subscription. AMZN gives it's streaming free as a bonus to prime shipping membership. Comcast gives it's for free with it's telecom offerings. ***What does DISCA package it's streaming with so that it's FREE?***

6. Average number of streaming services a person/family will have is 1-3. Very few will go past 4 or even 5. Now think about where DISCA will fit when [DIS, NFLX, and AMZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_services) are there locking up the top 3. Youtube is always free with streaming as a plus. It's left to fight for the scraps among Hulu, HBOMax, Peacock, Viacom, and AppleTV & other lesser rivals.

7. Content. I don't think Discovery even has the advantage on content. [NFLX/DIS/T/VIAC all beat it in content.](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/ranking-best-original-content-streaming)

8. Moat. There's no moat in the industry. If there was one then it's NFLX's name and the ability to package other services which I mentioned in 5. We're already oversaturated BEFORE factoring new entrants both in the states, Europe, and China.

I won't tell you to NOT buy DISCA. I just think it's a small fish in a crowded and ever-tightening pool of sharks. I've been in GOOG and T for years. The only reason I don't sell T is because I'm just pocketing dividends of the TELECOM company I bought. Not for the streaming. If I were to do some pickup I'd take VIAC over DISCA. 

I am also interested on your opinion on my assessment.","['CMCSA', 'DIS', 'DISCA', 'GOOGL', 'NFLX', 'VIAC', 'AMZN']"

I think that well-capitalized banks, lowered reserve ratios, and the recent fiscal policy on infrastructure/modernization spending (e.g., digital health, climate change, science and technology research) all point towards more lending/financing of growth areas.

Related party transactions and acquisitions have been a matter of habit for the Alibaba Partnership. In April 2014, Alibaba gave Simon Xie a $1 billion loan which he used to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media5 through an entity that was jointly owned by Jack Ma and Simon Xie. Alibaba claimed that they were not able to invest in Wasu Media directly because of Chinese regulations and that investing through Mr. Xie’s entity was the only way. In fact, Alibaba has regularly invested alongside Yunfeng Capital, a Shanghai based private equity company that was established by Jack Ma in 2010. The list of such related party transactions runs long and as recently as 2019 Alibaba Pictures gave a $103 million loan to struggling film studio Huayi Brothers Media in which Jack Ma has a considerable stake6. The lines between Alibaba’s shareholder interests and Jack Ma’s personal interests are very blurry, and at odds with our philosophy of backing clean and well aligned ownership structures.

Since Alibaba’s IPO, the asset base has grown tenfold from $18 billion to $185 billion or 48% per year.

However, this asset growth has mostly been driven by acquisitions and self-reported asset revaluations. Between 2014 and 2020, Alibaba has expanded their balance sheet by $92 billion in relation to equity investments (incl. goodwill recognised). In the same period, the ROAs have dropped from 26% to 13% and ROIC has fallen from 33% to 8%.

Alibaba management justifies these acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015, Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197. Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after four years in the red8.

Some of these acquisitions are in fact so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project10.",

Just a single (and possibly uninformed) perspective, but that has not been my experience working at a f100 financial services firm. We have multiple complex proprietary processing systems that we've spent tens of millions on, multiple large-scale data warehouse (each with thousands if not tens of thousands of tables), and a whole supporting cast of upstream, intermediate, and reporting systems. These systems are diverse, some proprietary, some purchased, and they have been stood up over decades. It takes our IT group many months to create or even modify integration between legacy systems. We have a small army of IT folks and have thrown an awful lot of cash at several top-tier consulting groups and none have had a magic bullet. Every RFP response promises nirvana, and all scale expectations once they open the hood understand the scale of our data issues.   

If these guys have a way to efficiently unify/link and homogenize diverse datasets, it is a very big deal and worth alot of money. Especially if they have found a way to structure unstructured data effectively, as they claim.

Hi again, I have another newbie question again.

What are the most reccomended indicators and overlays to use when trading? Right now I mainly use SMA (100), EMA(100) for overlays and RSI and MACD as my indicators. After that I check the EPS and PER plus the EBITDA.

I think it works, but honestly I'm not knowledgeable enough to asses whether this are the most useful indicators/overlays or not, so I ask.

Thanks in advance to anyone who answers.",
mravdj,gull8fl,investing,comment,1618491309,"I could use some advice on long term investing. I’m not really sure where my fiancée and I should start putting our money. I don’t have a lump sum amount to deposit, I’m just looking for something to contribute to with each paycheck. I’m not paying student loans right now due to the interest freeze so I could contribute $400-$500 a month probably. 

I’m a 27 year old man who lives in Ohio. I just got a raise and make $17.50 an hour which is around like 36.5k I think per year but after bonuses and OT I make in the low 40s. My fiancée is 23 F and makes $13 an hour. We both have bachelor degrees.

We don’t own a house yet, but that’s a goal within the next couple years. I live in a LCOL area so we could buy a modest home for around 150k-200k. 

I have 2k in savings, $400 in a HSA and 6.5k in my 401k. I recently started contributing 12% of my check and my company contributes 3%. The company I work for also has a pension plan which I’m 1.5 years away from being fully vested in. My fiancée also has about 2k in savings. She owes 3k on her car which will be paid off soon. My car is paid off and we don’t have credit card debt. 

I added $100 to my robinhood account on 2/23/21 just to experiment with and as of right now it’s at $257.09 already. This quick gain has gotten me more interested in investing but not sure where to start for safer, long term investments and I’d like to put my money somewhere else other than robinhood. I don’t have specific goals in mind, I just absolutely loathe working and want to retire at a decent age. That’s the goal I guess.

mrq6w6,,investing,post,1618527219,"Comstock Resources - Ticker CRK - Catalyst May 4th, 2021 - Company Q1 2021 EPS maybe over 50 cents vs street at 12 centsThis senate video just started floating around for Comstock Resources; information below is from the CFO's mouth. Go to hour 9 minute 30 for his spiel as all the information is pulled from his testimony. Ticker is CRK .

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

Going to buy options around Q1 earnings date (May 4th, 2021). May the Fourth be with us research monkeys! :)",['NI']

[Apple Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US)’s first product unveiling of 2021 will take place on April 20, the company said on Tuesday.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant dubbed the event “Spring Loaded” in a media invitation. Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business.","['AAPL', 'FB', 'TWTR']"

mquayi,,investing,post,1618417918,"Updated Paysafe DD: Medium to long term hold.Paysafe  offers a unique combination of fintech, crypto, iGaming, sports betting  and banking all rolled into one stock.  This is why NBC’s Cramer  recently said, “There is something about Paysafe that may be the  ultimate stock for this moment.” Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso  calls for $45-50 saying, “It’s the most excited I’ve been about a stock  in a long time.” So why is that?

Updated DD:

Partnered  with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch,  Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming,  etc.

Global electronic payment  platform with integrated cloud technology offering migration of eCash,  integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into  global banking as a service (with proprietary risk management enabling  mobile e-commerce for the 1.7 billion ”unbanked.”)

$58  trillion TAM.  Fund manager Cathie Wood: “Fintechs are going to gut  banks.” Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve predicts a  “$16 trillion market cap wholesale transition” of fintechs “taking over  and revolutionizing banking”

No. 1  global leader in iGaming eCash network. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market  volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected  to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

No.  2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. Owns Neteller  and Skrill, winner “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”,  “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current  ecosystems.”

No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing

Enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies)

Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Rapidly  expanding in US with new partnerships (last 3 months: Coinbase,  Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto) & new  legalized sports betting (this month: NY, WY, NH)

Trustpilot  in Europe (where more commonly used) rates Paysafe as “Excellent”  (4.7/5 stars) with over 24,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""poor"" (1.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Bill  Foley, Paysafe's Chairman of the Board, has a proven track record in  generating rapid synergistic inorganic growth. Over the last five years  Foley has grow Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X  ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS  from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those  characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with  Paysafe.”

Foley on Paysafe: “It’s  a fortress. It’s got a moat…We have a proven strategy of winning as new  global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory  risk and technical expertise…It’s going to be a land grab…I have a  vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there  first and to make sure we dominate. We’re focusing on gaming,  particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and  we’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting.”

Analyst  coverage: “We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within  the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical  footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply  revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe  there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level  legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a  unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and  offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential  legalization of iGaming in the United States.""

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections
2. From  published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,  bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.  Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to  fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected  10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

Recent signals of Blackstone/CVC’s long-term hold:

Last  week, Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said “We believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to  remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

FTAC’s Board of  Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward.”","['PYPL', 'GPN', 'FIS', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'WY']"

mr23mr,,investing,post,1618440740,"My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?",['TSLA']

mr3c8y,gujsw6r,investing,comment,1618445334,"If the case for equal weighted funds is so that you have more small cap exposure because small cap outperforms large cap, then it becomes a discussion on factors - specifically the size factor.

If you want more risk-adjusted return, equal weighting doesn't give you adequate exposure to the size factor.

You need a small-cap fund that filters out small-cap growth stocks, because historically they actually have a negative total return. You want a small-cap value fund ideally.

If the case for equal weighting is that you don't like FAANG and think tech is overvalued/the next tech bubble is about to burst, well, if you hold VTI and VXUS you're diversified, and that's the best you can do fundamentally. Otherwise you are moving into the realm of investor ""tastes"", which also doesn't have a good risk-adjusted return rate.",

Equal weight ETFs need to be continuously re-balanced with market movements changing the weights of the individual stocks.  This means that you'll constantly be losing money to the Bid-Ask spread.  Additionally, the ETF manager will generally charge a higher fee as they have to do more work to constantly maintain the equal weighting.

mqutep,,investing,post,1618419413,"Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM) DDHello, so this is my first dd post on reddit, and it'll be on Sprouts, a supermarket chain that specializes on healthy products and produce that i recently initiated a position in.

Recent events:

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

Share buybacks: 20% of outstanding shares have already been bought back and recently they were authorized to buy back $300m worth of shares.

Multiples:

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

TTM Revenues: 6.47b (55 per share), with about 4.5% profit margins.

Forward eps estimates(# of analysts):

2021: 1.86 (7)

2022: 2.05 (7)

2023: 2.57 (2)

2024: 3.16 (1)

2024 estimate seems ambitious but if they can achieve that it would be \~12% annualized growth from 2021 to 2024

Discounted cash flow: This is my first time using reddit charts so it'll be overly simplified and i'll try to be conservative with the estimates and i won't capitalize their leases, feel free to do your own as grocery chains are fairly easy to value compared to other industries, and if you i would appreciate a lot if you can share ($, in millions)

mqy9tn,,investing,post,1618429220,"Vicinity Motor Corp/Grande West Transportation TSXV: $VMC OTC: $BUSXD - Significantly undervalued with amazing growth opportunities ahead Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&t=454s&ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.
* They   are trying to break into the American market, and while I see good   signs that they will, their small size and newness to the market may   scare some clients and also means that if they mess up anything they   could really be hurting
* Speaking   of messing things up, their electric bus still has not passed testing   as that will happen in June.  I believe that it will pass with flying   colors based off of the results of their previous buses, but if it   doesn't for some reason they will be in a world of hurt.
* Delays   in completing their American facility in Washington could cause them  to  lose orders or have orders delayed which would cause their stock  price  to drop.

Positions:

Currently sitting at 1886 shares at an average price of $7.73 USD

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

It assumes that after the asset price doubling (from $11 to $22), the costs to mine the same quantity of bitcoin stays constant. This may be approximately true with gold. But with bitcoin, the difficulty of mining scales with the number of miners, which in turn scales with the price of the asset to maintain an equilibrium.

So in actuality, after the asset price doubling, it is much more likely to cost $20 to mine $22 worth of bitcoin. Profit margin stays the same as just buying and holding the asset.",

mq6e0u,guf9wli,investing,comment,1618353614,"So this is oversimplified to the point of probably being inflammatory, but here I go:

Firstly, our entire economy, not just the stock market, is predicated on the assumption that growth can and must continue infinitely. All credit and lending is based on the ideal that the supply of money will grow, allowing borrowers to pay off loans with interest and still come out ahead. The stock market's pyramid-ish tendencies are therefore not a risk unique to the stock market.

Secondly, it's my opinion that the U.S. government, and the corporations it is beholden to, are simply never going to let the stock market crash long-term if they can do anything at all to prevent it. That doesn't mean the bull market is infinite, but it means that on a long enough time horizon there are only two possible things that will follow a massive crash:

1) Investors who were properly diversified, and who have the time, cash buffer, and fortitude to hold and ride out the crash will eventually regain the value they lost (which was only ever lost on paper), and investors who have capital on hand to keep buying will make even more profit. 

2) The stock market never recovers, which can only mean the U.S. government as we know it has essentially collapsed, and at that point the fact that your portfolio is worth nothing is probably not your biggest concern.

Historically recessions facilitate more transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, because even though the wealthiest lose the most during a recession initially, the effect is temporary and they still have enough liquid capital on hand to buy up a bunch of assets at a discount from sellers who are hard pressed enough for short-term cash to sell at a loss. 

Bottom line, here's the secret to success: Diversify your investments, increase your cash allocation as you approach an age where you may not have the luxury of waiting for a recovery to play out, buy assets during recessions if you can, and hope that the government doesn't allow income inequality to get bad enough that the guillotines come out.",

British cyber security firm Darktrace has announced plans of a London listing said to value the company at £3bn ($4.1bn, €3.4bn).

Backed by tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, the company was founded in 2013 in Cambridge, UK and uses artificial intelligence (AI) to understand IT networks and detect attacks by identifying unusual behaviour.

Darktrace, which counts Rolls-Royce and Coca-Cola among its customers, claims to be the first company to use AI to detect and tackle cybersecurity threats on a large scale.

“NVIDIA today announced its first data center CPU, an Arm-based processor that will deliver 10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads.

The result of more than 10,000 engineering years of work, the NVIDIA Grace™ CPU is designed to address the computing requirements for the world’s most advanced applications — including natural language processing, recommender systems and AI supercomputing — that analyze enormous datasets requiring both ultra-fast compute performance and massive memory. It combines energy-efficient Arm CPU cores with an innovative low-power memory subsystem to deliver high performance with great efficiency.

“Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today’s computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC. Coupled with the GPU and DPU, Grace gives us the third foundational technology for computing, and the ability to re-architect the data center to advance AI. NVIDIA is now a three-chip company.”

mqbkui,,investing,post,1618347954,"A very bullish DD on $APD, a stock with good earnings, and a huge future of growthI've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (I'm not too informed on these, but here's what wikipedia has to say for those interested: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

In case you're not convinced yet, lets take a look at their competitors. LINDE PLC is the the leader by market cap, with revenues of $27.24 billion annually. APD have a YOY revenue of $8.86 Billion. However, take a look at net income. Despite only making $8.86 Billion, they have a net income of $1.9 billion (a profit margin of 21.5%),while Linde have a net income of $2.5 billion (profit margin of 9%). What makes APD even better is that they have been steadily increasing their YOY profit margin. Linde rocks a P/E ratio of about 60. I think it isn't crazy to put a similar price target on APD, which would essentially double their share price. Even on a bearish case, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to put such a prediction for this pricetag over the next 2-3 years. 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but they have far more room to grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it. There is certainly a bit of speculation here, but each projected market quote was taken from a reputable source.","['LIN', 'APD']"

It's a big chicken egg game; hydrogen producers won't create refueling stations (which are significantly more expensive than gas or electric stations) without sufficient volume of vehicles, and consumers won't buy hydrogen vehicles of there's no infrastructure and convenience.

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/15/young-people-stand-to-make-dismal-returns-on-their-investments

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

mqfk8l,,investing,post,1618361081,"Let's Clear Some Things Up About Zom . . .A few key panics I'm seeing online. And just a quick response to others I've seen talk about insider trading. 



1. Company Insiders are selling. 

True 

Yup, they are. And they will continue for the rest of this company's life. They will also eventually buy some as well. It gets scheduled quarterly. It's how companies work. Even Apple. Even Telsa. 

But, something you need to understand was this has been planned since the beginning of February. Its common. 

Here is that form from Feburary... 

https://investors.zomedica.com/node/8536/html 

Here is the website to look at all the Form 4's from today. Note the bottom green wording about Rule 10b5. 

https://investors.zomedica.com/sec-filings 

Here is that rule.. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp 

To conclude, this was just coincidence that they planned to sell their shares while we are in the middle of pretty ruthless selloff . They planned this months ago. I'm sure they were hoping for more but weren't we all. If they really were scammy, I'm sure Cohen could have put out some PR right before today to jump the price of his employees, but they didn't. 

2. Cartridges were sold out? 

Maybe. 

We can't confirm as to why they were off the Miller website yesterday. But, as of this afternoon, they are back. Would be very Bullish if they sold out though. Although maybe someone can confirm, wasn't there 5 of them? Now I only see 3 back so far. 

https://millervet.shop/catalogsearch/result/?q=Truforma+


3. Institutions are selling. 

False. 

Don't get me wrong, Institutions buy and sell all the time but from the discrepancy from the Fintel and Nasdaq, it seems like institutional buying is increasing especially at these prices. Somewhat hard to tell though because they only are required to report quarterly. 

https://fintel.io/so/us/zom 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/zom/institutional-holdings


4. A reverse split is imminent. 

False. 

A bear favorite. It would need to get approved by shareholders, and for which it has been voted against twice. However, a share buyback was approved and will likely happen at some point. The details are not completely clear as to when, but the cheaper the share the more likely the buyback. 



At the end of the day, this period can suck. That said, everyone was begging for these prices again a month ago. Well here we are. Don't get twisted, no one knows where this is headed, it clearly seems manipulated by something stronger than retail buyers. Dropping 5-10% and barcoding for the rest of the day is not normal stock behavior. Because of that, I dont really think this has a floor anywhere in particular. It will be whenever the shorts change their narrative. 


This isn't some post to convince you to buy Zom. I just think there is alot of negative sentiment and misleading information out there. For now, make your own decisions about Zomedica. Nothing about this company has changed other than they are guaranteed revenue for the first time. 

Not financial advice but you already knew that.

It looks like they have about 60M in working capital with little debt and their annual burn rate is only around 16M so they shouldn't have to raise more money in the short term - which is about the only good thing about this company.

Maybe I should buy some ETFs, but again, which ones? There are not so much available for me - most of them are ruled by Russian banks. And I'm afraid they could collapse after sanctions or some other shit.

The only one which is semi-international is FinEx: FXUS, FXDE, FXWO and so on.

With individual stocks I'm more confident, because I'm an shareholder and present in all the required registries. So, I could restore access to my shares if something happens.

The price is less profit compared to ETF and more time spent on tracking companies.

&#x200B;

My current plan is to buy individual stocks regularly. I would chose companies from S&P500 and add some less reliable like ENPH, PLTR.

Short term plan is to buy: little oil (XOM), some cruise (like Carnival), more green energy (NEE), add no-tech companies like Walmart, McDonald's, Procter&Gamble. Also I was thinking about LHA.

So, I would like to diversify, but be more tech.","['DIS', 'NEE', 'UAL', 'WMT', 'MCD', 'MSFT', 'ENPH', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'XOM', 'CCL']"

**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Which are all companies that have to do with automobiles, electric vehicles, or technology closely related to those categories.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

[Canoo had another no revenue Quarter ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter)

My thoughts: I think that while the recent class action Lawsuit may cause some issues for the company Canoo has a unique product that could become popular, has enough cash to run the business for multiple years even if the release is delayed, and has good management that is in touch with the business Canoo is in.","['DE', 'GM']"

If we are going to run with the $65 billion number than someone could break this record tomorrow.

mpgnog,,investing,post,1618242555,"Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023. Mobileye is working with the startup Udelv to manufacture 35,000 delivery vehicles[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023)

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”",['INTC']

mprkx9,,investing,post,1618275211,"About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM ESTOn Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

We'll know Tuesday at 8:30 AM EST. It could be interesting.",
mprkx9,gucgqvb,investing,comment,1618296862,"I don't think it's clear what the market will do in either case.

Higher than expected -> buy because you'd rather hold assets? sell because you think the fed will ease off?

Lower than expected -> buy because you think the fed will continue to print? sell because cash isn't being devalued as everyone expects?

mprkx9,gud62bb,investing,comment,1618318523,"It was up .6% in March.

I realize I don't know nearly as much as them, but doesn't inflation have a psychological effect, that feeds on itself? When people see prices rising quickly they change their behavior, which causes prices to rise more, etc...

mpllls,,investing,post,1618256463,"In-depth DD on Bio Stock Nearing Approval of Breakthrough Drug to Treat Depression: Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) 

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

In the long-term, money will flow to those firms that increase their revenues and earnings (which ultimately are able to deliver the greatest amount of cash back to their shareholders). In the short-term you might see some volatility or discrepancies but in the long-term, money follows where money is being made.

This is part of the efficient market framework that people are  so quick to dismiss. Can Tesla or Gamestop continue to have high valuations? Sure...but if they don't start making that expected future cash via increasing earnings and revenues, the market will let Elon Musk and Ryan Cohen know pretty quick.

This is why people like me always recommend a globally-diversified, low-cost index fund like VT. Money will flow wherever the cash is been made.

mohir3,,investing,post,1618104600,"Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s whyWhich is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

I'm not sure now that properties are very expensive and don't cash flow nearly as well (or, usually at all) you can expect the same safe and robust returns. 

Though owning your own home is probably a safe expense to have regardless. The equity building process can be almost like constantly putting money in a bank account pegged to inflation.

SNPW's  teams:

Medrecycler, Sun Pacific Power, Street Smart Outdoors, and   National Mechanical Group  (non glass  solar panels)  are just about done with their exhibition season and about ready  to play for real.

What the exhibition season has revealed so far about the  SNPW teams

\-  The Company’s subsidiary Medrecycler RI, Inc. continues to progress  through the regulatory process  for the approval to construct a 48,000  SF state-of-the-art pyrolysis  facility expected to process 70 tons of  medical waste per day. With approval and the completion of financing,  the project should be operational by the end of 2021

\-  One man who reviewed the tech of Medrecycler has enough faith in the   technology and business plan, that he sees fit to committed 17 MILLION   DOLLARS to buy all the Rhode Island bonds to finance the project.

\-  Many cities have shown faith in the LONG TERM VALUE of Street Smart  outdoor advertising to award them decade long contracts.  Street Smart  is expanding and adding new services to it;s product.  Geopath is  expected to support a strategy for expanding our market reach to  targeted advertisers in the OOH industry and  Atlas Transit Solutions to  collaborate on the development of a  high efficiency off grid digital  plug and play modular unit will  develop a new SMART Bus Shelter which  integrates a new software as a  service that enhances the commuters  experience while driving a new  unique and proprietary product offering

\-  The US Patient office after viewing the science  the technology   granted 5 patents o the Non-glass solar panels and the manufacturing  process for it.  UL certification for the non glass solar panels iare in  the process

\- Free agents were  signed to aid in the Durango Mexico Solar Farm team,  one a solar farm  developer the other a financial backer. Durango Mexico Solar Farm  project  currently undergoing a financial review with a selected EPC and  funding group. This partnership is targeting a financial closing and  the commencement of construction in 2021

As  the exhibition season winds down, we have a chance to evaluation what  type of play we expect to see once the real season begins.

mo5ii4,gu1mw1u,investing,comment,1618064549,URNM - it is directly affected by the demand for uranium. It's also been doing consistently well over these last several weird weeks in the market,
mo5ii4,gu1sh4k,investing,comment,1618067465,"Nuclear power in Europe is currently declining, and I would expect it would continue to decline. There are a few nuclear reactors currently under construction in Europe (UK, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia) but they won't replace the reactors that will be closing.

However, nuclear power is growing in Asia, particularly in China and India. China is currently building a number of reactors, with plans to build many more in order to transition away from coal. Globally, nuclear energy accounts for about 10% of the energy mix and the IAEA projects that by 2050, it will account for somewhere between 6-12%.

Keep in mind that the construction of new reactors is very costly and takes a long time. Maybe there is a play there with reactor construction. The shorter term catalyst in the uranium market will be currently operating nuclear plants securing long-term contracts for supply. Prices have been depressed for a decade and continue to be below the global cost of production. Miners were slow to respond, and there was a lot of existing supply in national stockpiles that were being put into the market, but in the last few years production has been tapering off and is below global demand. At some point, power plants will have to step back into the market and sign multi-year deals to secure supply. Its worth noting as well that the cost of uranium is a pretty small part of the price of generating the power, so plants have plenty of room to pay more.

I would stick to ETFs to get broad sector coverage because it's hard to pick winners and losers. URNM was already mentioned, which is a good choice. My money is currently in URA, which is slightly more concentrated with a slightly lower fee. You're a little late to the game as money has already started to move back into the sector, but there still should be a lot of room for growth as demand picks up.

Edit: After reading a lot of the posts that have been made since I first posted, I would just like to add that this is supposed to be an investing subreddit. The OP didn't ask what you or your friends think about nuclear energy. Nor did he ask you to dream about a time when nuclear energy won't be necessary.

Nuclear power is in decline globally, but still accounts for a large part of the global power mix and is growing in some parts of the world. If you think it isn't ethical, then don't invest your money. Do I want to own Cameco stock in 100 years? No. Will I take the 60% I've made off it already, plus the potential upside of another 100% when uranium prices recover? Yes.

If you don't know about nuclear energy or uranium mining, you shouldn't talk about it on an investing sub. In 2 years, my investments in the uranium mining space have returned an average of 100%. I've sold a bit when prices peaked, but I'm still holding most because uranium prices still haven't recovered. Maybe we can start talking about how to make money, instead of whether fusion reactors are the future or whatever.",
modaz8,,investing,post,1618089578,"Assets Have Tanked at Two of the World’s Biggest Short Sellers**Short Selling is a Risky Business.** 

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”","['TWTR', 'TSLA']"

In theory it sounds like a great place to put a percentage of assets to reduce risk in a portfolio.  And right after a big crash when people look at the returns it seems even more prudent.  But deeper and deeper into a bull market, the lessons of the last crash are forgotten, the returns of such a fund look miserable compared to the general market, and people naturally pull their money out.   The nail in the coffin is bull markets are generally seven or eight years and bear markets are one or two.  It looks like a bad business model.",

mok1fb,,investing,post,1618114299,"$MHH - Value Stock in this market; my DDMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

The S&P 500 fell 0.12%, after hitting a record high of 4,130.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, or 86 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.44%.

Consumer discretionary and financials supported the broader market's move to record highs, with the latter coming under the spotlight as major banks report quarterly earnings this week.

Major Wall Street banks reporting include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Wall Street's outlook on quarterly earnings appears bullish, with cyclicals backed to show strong quarterly results.

""We anticipate S&P 500 Index earnings per share will grow by more than 30% this year with cyclical sectors such as industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, and financials leading the way,"" Wells Fargo said.

Energy stocks slipped on a retreat oil prices from session highs as investors weighed up the ongoing progress on vaccinations against ongoing Covid-19 restrictions that threaten energy demand.  

Technology started the week on the backfoot stifled by weakness in chip stocks and mixed trading among the Fab 5.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was higher.

Microsoft said it will buy speech-recognition firm Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) for $19.7 billion in a bid to boost its foray into healthcare.

""The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors at a time in which hospitals and doctors are embracing next generation AI capabilities from thought leaders such as Nuance,"" Wedbush said in a note.

In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was down 1% just days after the company urged 16 airline customers to ground its 737 Max jets, citing electrical issues. The issues, however, are not expected to cause major disruptions.

""Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note Friday.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped more than 3% after receiving an upgrade from Canaccord, citing a bullish outlook for the company's battery storage business.

Canaccord upgraded Tesla to buy from hold, and lifted its price on the company to $1,071 from $419 per share.","['NDAQ', 'GOOGL', 'BA', 'BAC', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'FB', 'DOW', 'GS', 'SPGI', 'WFC', 'JPM', 'AAPL']"

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

-	Investor sentiment remains unchanged.  No new “buzz-worthy” events are coming up and no recent company news that I see promises to serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest or inflows. 

So what’s changed? Anything?

Are these assumptions correct or did I miss something? What makes BABA an attractive investment to consider now, rather than a wait-and-see story which may or may not see upside in the near- to mid-term? Or should I assume this is a dead money play for the reasons stated above.

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent. Down to flat are the trends, so they’ll continue until they have reason not to. Opportunity cost says steer clear.",

mok0m1,,investing,post,1618114213,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",
mok0m1,gu4oqfr,investing,comment,1618128647,I think this is a version of a long-short alpha strategy (or whatever) but the flaw may be that those companies may be expensive to short if the market already thinks they’re losers. Also puts may not be available.,

mobt6t,,investing,post,1618084613,"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claimsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it has found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.",

Do they need to ship products? Do they rely on paper? Do they use energy? Where are they sourcing their paper, pens, desks/furniture and other supplies? The world is just too intertwined to avoid having your money make its way back into the hands of companies with unethical practices, and anyone who thinks that they're making a difference by looking for ESG companies are kidding themselves.

I definitely think that we should all be trying to make the world a better, more ethical place, but I don't think this is a good avenue for making that change.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

(C+C appreciated, as I had a lot of fun researching and writing this) 

Stock Ticker: NVS

Market: NYSE 

Name: Novartis

Category; Pharmaceuticals

Why investigate this stock? 

With the opioid crisis and its ramifications coming into the media spotlight, there has been an increasing body of research into the use of suboxone for treatment of opioid dependence disorder (ODD). For those of you unfamiliar with suboxone, it is a combination of buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication acts as a partial opioid agonist, and the naloxone component helps prevent abuse. In toxicology and ""Medication Assisted Treatment"" circles, it is becoming favored over methadone due to decreased side effect profile and decreased potential for abuse. Recently, some states have significantly expanded training programs so providers can easily obtain an “X waiver”, which is a qualification required for a medical provider to prescribe suboxone. This suggests that it will be increasingly used in Emergency Departments to initiate ODD treatment, and it will see increasing use in the outpatient clinic setting. 

So why Novartis?

For those of you familiar with Suboxone’s history, it is actually made by the drug company Reckitt Benckiser. However, recently they authorized a generic version which is to be distributed by, you guessed it, Novartis (technically a subsidiary Sandoz, but all traded under the ticker NVS)

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:\~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior).

I’m not saying that generic suboxone is going to be “the next big thing”, however I think it will be mainstay of ODD treatment moving forward in the US given low cost, increasing ease of access, and low(er) side effect profile when compared to other medications for ODD. (Some of you may remember Vivitrol aka long acting Naltrexone, see the head to head vs suboxone here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext))

Now let’s look into some aspects of the stock itself. 

P/E Ratio: \~ 24 

S/p 500 P/E: \~ 34 

I like to look at the P/E ratio as a good starting point to see if the stock is over/under valued compared to its earnings. This can suggest the ability to weather downturns in a market that trends towards over-valuing stocks compared to their real world earnings. 

Next, the relative strength index (RSI). For those of you unfamiliar it is a momentum indicator (I have my own opinions on momentum investing, which I can talk about in a different post). Whether you fall on the side of a value investor or a momentum investor, I think it’s an interesting index to take a look at for any stock, and can help you “time” your purchase. **Remember, there is no end all be all market index.** Regardless, the RSI was developed in 1978 and evaluates price changes to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI is listed from 0-100, with a value < 30 suggesting that a stock is undervalued, and should be bought. A value > 70 suggests a stock is overvalued and should be sold. If you’re interested, take a look into how it is calculated to see why a higher RSI suggests overvalue. 

Anyways, the RSI of Novartis as of this post is 54.4, with a steady trend upwards since February. So what does that suggest? Basically that it is neither overbought or oversold, but has a trend towards being overbought, which doesn’t help us much. . 

Here’s a few good resources to check RSI on stocks you’re interested in: 

[https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab\_name=rsi](https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab_name=rsi)

[https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563)

Looking at the financials of NVS for Q4, they are reassuring. 

See here for financial stats, but they can easily be googled otherwise: 

[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo)

The company demonstrated strong Q4 performance, with increases in Revenue, Net Income, and Profit Margins. However, using the golden rule that **past performance is not indicative of future performance** (except when one takes advantage of specific aspects of momentum investing, again to be discussed in a later post), I would not recommend using financial performance metrics to guide purchases (especially in highly volatile markets), but they do give you a snapshot of the company’s current financial environment. 

Above I’m suggesting that generic suboxone will likely provide a value to the company overtime, as suboxone gains prominence in treatment of ODD. However, what else is NVS up to? 

COVID 19

No covid 19 therapeutics, however Novartis is assisting Pfizer and CureVac in production capacity. Specifically, they will be assisting in filling the vials. I don’t think this will contribute much financially, but it’s good PR, and lets face it good for human kind. 

Current Pharmaceuticals

Novartis is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, so I’m not going to go into an exhaustive list of their products. You can find them on the wikipedia page here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals)

However, many of their drugs have good staying power. Of note, they make Entresto, an Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibitor. For my renal nerds out there take a look at the mechanism, really awesome stuff.. There was a lot of buzz in the medical community about Entresto a few years back. This NEJM trial was huge, showing that the Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibition was superior to Enalapril in reducing risks of death and hospitalization. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor medication which has become a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077)

Digital Health

Novartis recently partnered with Science 37, who has developed an interesting system for virtual clinical trials. COVID 19 was a catalyst for digital health, and I think companies that provide telehealth platforms are going to continue to grow. Many patients love the telehealth option, and often opt for it over an in-person visit for many smaller medical issues/checkups. 

Clinical Trials 

As a large pharmaceutical company, Novartis has a well established clinical pipeline for research. I find that betting on the “next big thing” or breakthrough in therapy is typically a losing bet, especially because you have no idea what the results will be as molecular therapies and typical pharmaceuticals go through the rigorous phases of clinical trials. It is a better to bet on a company that has a lot of experience bringing products to market, with a large research pool to pull from. This article has a great table demonstrating the “success rates” of various drug classes coming to market: 

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:\~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate).

(Spoiler: It’s not good) 

Overall, NVS has demonstrated steady growth, and is a huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. They have a large pool of research and will be responsible for the generic version of Suboxone, which I believe will have a strong role in treatment of ODD moving forward in the opiate crisis. The technicals on NVS are pretty middle of the road, with a reassuring P/E ratio and a dead center RSI. I think it would be a good value investment in the long term, but short term gains may be difficult. 

Finally, what I think is appropriate for the end of all DD posts, is that this isn’t me telling you to buy or sell this stock. Rather, I’ve compiled some information about the company that should be a starting point for your own research and evaluation",['PFE']

mobmuc,,investing,post,1618084019,"Smith & Nephew (SNN) - Sports injury/hip-replacement play still over 20% discounted from CovidI don't regularly make posts about individual securities...actually this would be my first. I'm tired of daily DD posts on companies that are at ATH, so here's a mini-DD on one that is still heavily discounted from Covid. And of course...this is not investment advice, do your own due diligence.

Let's look at where they made their business in 2020:

- $1.9 billion in revenue in orthopedics: mainly knee implants, hip implants, & trauma devices.

- $1.3 billion in sports medicine

- $1.3 billion in wound management

So we have a company that makes most of their revenue in sports, injuries, and hip/knees. Literally all things that were put on halt due to Covid. As to be expected, 2020 was a terrible year for them, with revenue down 11.2% and EPS down 25%. They also under-performed all their larger peers (i.e. Striker, Zimmer Biomet) whom thanks to more diversified products were not hit as hard.

I believe most of their under-performance is due to events that are transitory:

- Decline in sports injuries due to Covid.

- Postponement of knee/hip surgeries due to Covid.

- Brexit (they are a UK company)

- Inability to effectively run their sales due to Covid & lockdowns.


Let's look at some headwinds that I think the market is not factoring in:

- They have actually increased their R&D budget by nearly 5% during Covid, while most other device companies are tightening.

- The UK is planning to increase corporate taxes to 25% in 2023, however they will have a temporary 130% super-deduction for plant/equipment through March 2023. Meanwhile, UK plans no change to their 13% credit on R&D. I believe SNN, a device manufacturer, will be an out-sized beneficent of this change in tax policy.

- Potential buyout opportunity from one of the larger device makers.

Finally, SNN's debt looks reasonable, and Price/Sales ratio is literally almost at the same spot it was in 2014/2015..a rarity in this market. And their revenue growth has slowly climbed from $3.8 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2019, only falling down to $4.5 billion in 2020. So 2020 was, other than a small drop in 2012, the only year they had a major decline in revenue.

If it's not clear by now I am long SNN. I purchased after Covid and planning for a long term hold...now I'm waiting for schools to re-open, sports to come back in full force, and for people to get injured again rather than sit at home in their bubble. It's only a matter of time before people are playing hockey, or recreational soccer.

**Wrestlemania 37** (WWE) is this weekend and returning with a live audience. One of the marquee matches: Big E vs Apollo Crews in a Nigerian Drum Fight. I don't know exactly what a Nigerian Drum Fight is, but I smell $$$ for the sports-injury device company Smith+Nephew.",['ZBH']

\-A soon to be named auto company is entering a deal with Arbe that will result in 300 million in sales for one model, and could account for 10x (3 billion) in sales for more models.

\-The auto company is likely a US company because it is described as “Western” while the OEM described next to this mystery Western company in the presentation is described as “European”(If it’s a Western and not European, it’s likely a US company) *(\*See investor presentation slide 22)*

\-Elon Musk is quoted in the Arbe investor presentation - “Lidar is doomed” (\*Agree or disagree with Musk feeling this way today, the company is making a point in their presentation about the value of their \~$100 radar on chip IP outperforming the Lidar tech that can costs $1,000’s)

\-Arbe is a “First Mover” and “Market Leader” in 4D imaging radar technology-(Slide 16). This positions them to be chosen first to take the place of traditional radars in the exact same slot that is already built in for radar use, but can now be used for 4D imaging radar chips.

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# What new customer/company fits the description of the largest new deal?

**Customer description #1 -** It is “One of the largest automobile companies in the **world”** *(\*See the Arbe CEO’s merger webcast))*

**Customer description #2 -** It is a “Leading, Global, Western” company\*-(presumably not with a homebase in Europe for reasons described above\*\*\*)\*\* *(\*See Investor presentation slide 22)*

**Company that meets both descriptions** **=** One of the US’s “Big Three” -- **General Motors $GM, Ford $F, or Chrysler/Stellantis $STLA** *\*Although there are no guarantees that it will be one of these 3, there are not many other companies that fit both above descriptions given by Arbe*

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Who is Arbe Robotics / $ITAC and what do they do?

\-$ITAC recently merged with Arbe Robotics to create a publicly traded company

\-Their product is the first and only available long-range, 4D Imaging Radar (so little to no competition)

\-Their 4D Imaging Radar:

\>Is used in personal cars, trucking, delivery, industry, agriculture, mining, etc. \*(Primary / most profitable focus is the automotive industry)

\>Is needed for every level of vehicle autonomy (Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

\>Supposedly outperforms Lidar and Cameras, especially in fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and other poor conditions (see performance details below)

\>Fits in the same slot that current, old radars fit in, but their radar provides over 100x better quality, and a 4th dimension, allowing you to “see” objects in a new way

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Is Arbe’s technology a “disruptor” with a large market opportunity?

1. Qamcom’s CEO explains why Arbe’s technology is a disruptor that supersedes existing alternatives - “Choosing Arbe as a partner was an obvious choice since there is no other radar chipset solution on the market that is comparative,” said Johan Lassing, chief executive officer of Qamcom. “Traditional or contemporary radar solutions don’t solve the challenges that autonomous vehicles face. Arbe revolutionized radar by creating a sensor that provides a never-before-seen image which is close to the image that vision based sensors achieve that also has the properties of radar – Arbe’s 4D Imaging Radar Solution has the potential to be the primary sensor candidate for the sensor suite of any autonomous and semi-autonomous applications and next generation perception platforms.”
2. The CEO says their new 4D Visual Radar technology is designed to fit in the same spot as existing radars, making it immediately usable by auto companies[ ](https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/173-noam-arkind-arbe-robotics/id1353975287?i=1000501753796)
3. The 4D Imaging Radar is suitable for every level of vehicle autonomy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
4. Already has “key partnerships” with Nvidia, Valeo, Denso, and other reputable/large companies involving their radar-on-chip technology (\*See slide 9 of investor presentation)
5. The technology can be used outside of cars - e.g. mines, agriculture, trucking, delivery, more -[ ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/qamcom-will-bring-arbes-4d-imaging-radar-to-trucks-mines-and-farms/)
6. CEO claims their main competitor is Mobileye (\*Mobileye was bought out by Intel for $15 million). CEO claims Mobileye will have a chipset in 2025 that is similar to what Arbe already has today (\*See investor webcast link below)
7. Resolution and performance supersedes all existing radar technology[ ](https://www.embedded.com/imaging-radar-development-platform-offers-2k-resolution/)
8. The Arbe CEO explains their IP value “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""

# Valuation/Profitability considerations

\-Arbe CEO said “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""[ https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc\_src=social-sh&soc\_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&__twitter_impression=true)

\-The Arbe CEO says ""When Mobileye passed $300 million in revenue, the figure that we are expecting for 2025, Intel bought them for $15 billion.”

\-The Spac transaction values Arbe at a low $572 million enterprise value, implying only a 1.8x multiple on 2025 forecasted revenue and a 4.4x multiple on 2025 forecasted pro forma Adjusted EBITDA \*This presumably does not account for new or unexpected deals that may arise of the 10 auto companies they are currently in final stage talks with, or the company referred to as “one of the largest auto companies in the world”

\-ITAC/Arbe has a small, 7.7 million share public float which could move quickly when catalysts are revealed (\*Institutional elements of the non-public float include a PIPE paid for by respected “strong hand” institutional investors such as M&G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures, and Eyal Waldman-(founder and CEO of Mellanox Technologies $MLNX))

\-The institutional portion of the float is unlikely to sell - “What matters is not the price or the valuation at the time of the flotation, but in the long term; especially when the **holdings of all the existing shareholders are vested for at least a year**, so you don't sell in a hurry“[ ](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-has-more-unicorns-than-all-of-europe-1001366171)

\-The CEO recently recommended that shareholders hold shares until they reach a $15 billion dollar market cap-(This is his 3rd company and he believes this company will reach that)(\*This source is described as “Israel's largest and most popular news and content website”) -[ ](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5907598,00.html)

# Stock details

\-Common shares are trading around NAV at the time of this post

\-Warrants are redeemable with typical SPAC rates: 1 for 1 at an 11.50 strike price, with a 5 year expiration (redeemable only if the common SP stays above $18 for 20 of 30 trading days)

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Summary

Arbe developed and patented a new type of 4D radar imaging technology that negates the need for expensive lidar and vastly improves existing camera/radar performance (over 100x better than existing radar). Arbe is the “first mover” in the market, with little to no competition. The new 4D imaging radar fits in the same slot in a car that the older radar technology uses, making the transition easy for auto companies. The total market for the product includes all Tiers of vehicles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The price was designed to be virtually the same as existing radars-($100 per unit, $150 for premium), and is drastically more affordable than paying $1,000’s for lidar. Arbe’s 4D radar vastly outperforms the more expensive Lidar in many conditions such as fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and more, making it indispensable for both ADAS and autonomous applications.

\*Value will be confirmed by catalyst/deals soon, as the CEO has many quotes describing deals they are signing to be publicized shortly (see above).

I feel comfortable with a 100% stocks allocation at this point (still 30 years off from retirement) and am considering exchanging all my Target Retirement shares for VTSAX shares, which will hopefully do better for me in the long run (I would continue my weekly investments in VTSAX for the future).

The current valuation of $10B dwarfs the $4B it was valued at in a private funding round in 2020, and at approximately $1B more than Beyond Meat. This is despite the fact that BYND brought in 400M in FY revenue compared to Impossible Meat's 150M estimated annual revenue.

I personally don't see any angle from which $10B can be justified. Future growth for the next decade is priced in at the current valuation and it strikes me as a massive bust waiting to happen.",

The [Pi Cycle Top Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/) (warning - terrible on mobile) has historically been effective in picking out the timing of market cycle highs to within 3 days.
It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2.

Note: The multiple is of the price values of the 350DMA not the number of days.

For the past three market cycles, when the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking.

It is also interesting to note that 350 / 111 is 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. In fact, it is the closest we can get to Pi when dividing 350 by another whole number.

It once again demonstrates the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price action over long time frames. Though in this instance it does so with a high degree of accuracy over the past 7 years.

IMO, indicators like these are likely to be only coincidental, although, it’s past accuracy warrants it’s significance. It must be taken into account as well as all previous tops have been blow off tops rather than an Elliott wave ending diagonal (if bitcoin is topping right now). This discrepancy may reduce its accuracy.

However, [my own personal amateur TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/DAn0UXkz-Bitcoin-close-to-Macro-Top/) seems to share a bearish stance. (Note- TA is from early February but trend lines have not been broken so it is still relevant) [Sentiment](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/relative-unrealized-profit--loss/) also seems to be in the ballpark of previous macro tops. 

Having said this, I am only an amateur and i wouldn’t put much stock into my opinion. It is most likely flawed and history has shown it is incredibly hard to predict the pops of bubbles. I could easily see bitcoin exploding to 100k next week. I would not be surprised at all. I am just urging cautiousness, please be sure to set stop losses.",

mn8840,,investing,post,1617937608,"JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground)

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",['JPM']

Still, despite this, Naspers for years traded at a substantial discount. Mutual fund FPA Crescent tried a long Naspers short Tencent trade for a long time (just owning Tencent would have been a better idea.) In an attempt to narrow that discount, they spun out the Tencent stake and the other tech investments into Prosus, which (last I looked) still trades at a discount.

Prosus sold 2% and still owns around 28% of Tencent. Also, ""It also promised not to sell any further Tencent shares for at least the next three years."" (https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html)

mn9mjt,,investing,post,1617942867,"[DD] Bull or Bear: Nano X Imaging (NNOX)General disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

---

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

I would have a price target of NNOX at $50 (for the risk adverse) - $100 (if you truly believe).","['GOOGL', 'WAT']"

mn9mjt,gtxbw14,investing,comment,1617973082,">$40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX

This seems extremely expensive in the PACS/RIS space.

edit:
So, for folks who haven't worked in this industry, here's a normal radiology workflow:

1. Your doctor orders a study be done.
1. Scheduling dept creates a work order/appointment in their RIS (radiology information system). This is usually integrated into the HIS (hospital information system) of the Hospital that the DR is affiliated to/has admitting privileges to.
1. Patient shows up for their xray, so they get checked in on the RIS. 
1. Rad tech pulls up the work order on the RIS, preps the patient, and takes photos with the ""modality"" - what people in the industry call things like XRay machines, CT scanners, Ultrasound machines, nuke med machines, and so on. This is basically the ""camera takes photos"" portion. The modality is the camera. They produce photos that can either be printed to film (in the old days) or more likely get digitally transferred into a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System). This company makes cameras, basically. They don't make the photos, they don't make the photo album.
1. The study shows up for the radiologist to read in the PACS. They read it and dictate their findings in the PACS.
1. The dictation shows up in a worklist for a transcriptionist to transcribe into the medical record in the PACS or RIS.
1. The radiologist checks and approves the transcription in the PACS.
1. The study is made available to the requesting doctor with the findings, and the patient gets appropriate treatment.

So out of this entire multistep workflow, this company only seems to make the camera portion. This portion is not usually done as an ""as a service"" since these are huge $6-$8 figure machines, that can require tens of thousands to millions to even get installed. 

Support contracts may be based off of quantity of studies performed, but they're not charging 35% of dang price of every single study. That's absurd. There'd be no incentive to move away from plate + film printing since it would cost more in fees than it would in film doing things ""the old fashioned way"".

That makes me think they're trying to bundle in PACS functionality, but that's absolutely not a good thing. PACS systems are how you store the photos, and retrieve them for viewing, dictating readings, etc.

PACS systems often charge ingestion/storage/viewing fees to access the studies. But even then the pricing is absurd. The PACS system I personally ran charged a few dollars per study, scaling depending on the type (tiny nuke med studies were cheaper than massive mammo studies or gigantic multislice CT scans). XRays are near the low end of the requirements scale. They're just singular pictures, and there's usually only a handful of them. They aren't a ""hot ticket"", which would price them above the competition. 

So, maybe they're relying on the PACS to be *""that good""* - then you've got the issue with PACS/HIS/RIS systems being extremely sticky, and hospitals likely have one already. That means a huge burden to switch.

The medical arena has made it a standard of not having standards. This means any time you attempt to change something, you have to hire specialists called HL7 Programmers to re-implement the gateway systems that translate information between all of these disparate systems and standards. Yes - they made a standard out of the translation system between the standards, rather than implementing a single standard.

The overhead is so massive that many PACS/HIS/RIS vendors will literally give away the modalities and supporting ecosystems to entice customers to switch, figuring they can make it up on support contracts. Modalities like the one this company is making.

There's a massive moat here.

The end has an excellent explanation for what led to the inflation of the late '70s-'80s.

The money supply does not make prices go up or down on its own.

&#x200B;

We all know that gaming is growing and that it will be a good market to be in for the long term.  According to Grand View Research [The Video Game Market is Projected to grow at 12.9% CAGR from 2020-2027 and the Streaming market will have a CAGR of 20.4% over the same time period](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-gaming-market-size-worth-7-24-billion-by-2027--cagr-48-2-grand-view-research-inc-301220945.html#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Market%20%E2%80%93%20The%20global,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027). also, the [Gaming Headset market is projected to have a 7.5% CAGR from 2020-2026](https://www.wboc.com/story/43596299/gaming-headset-market-2021-is-estimated-to-clock-a-modest-cagr-of-75nbspduring-the-forecast-period-2021-2026-with-top-countries-data)  I am sure that there are other projections which are more than this and that there are others that there are less. However, I would argue even if the numbers are 10% instead of 12.9%, 17% instead of 20.4% and 6% instead of 7.5% that you would want to jump into this industry as it is going to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

Now a little background on [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)

&#x200B;

Turtle Beach was originally founded in the 1970s and their main goal was making sound software/hardware for musicians. In 2005, however, they decided to use their experience in engineering sound to create headsets for gamers and that has been what they have focused on since.  If you want more info on their history you can go [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Beach_Corporation)

&#x200B;

Now Turtle beach is  known for their gaming headsets - they have nearly half the market share in gaming headsets per their last earnings call [You can see the earnings call transcript here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411642-turtle-beach-corporation-hear-ceo-juergen-stark-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) in addition to this, however, they also own [Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/) and [Neat Microphones](https://www.neatmic.com/)

&#x200B;

So now that we have a little background on Turtle beach, I will give you the reasons that I think they are set up perfectly to capture this growing market and to grow in the years to come.

&#x200B;

The Financials:

[Yahoo finance financials for HEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEAR/financials/)

&#x200B;

2 things really stick out for me for Turtle beach when you compare them to the other companies in the industry: 1. their balance sheet and 2. their cost of revenue

If you look at the balance sheet you will see the have an objectively great balance sheet.  $167 in Current assets  - $47 million of which is Cash on hand and $78 Million in Current liabilities - almost all of which is short term payable and accrued expenses. The bottom line is **the company has $47 million in cash and $0 in debt**.  They also have a great gross profit - coming in at about 37% of revenue. which when compared to companies in their industry like Corsair who has a 27% gross profit %.

&#x200B;

Now is where I think people really miss out on Turtle Beach, everyone thinks they are still just a headset company, primarily for consoles - obviously their ticker  doesn't help this image, but they are expanding their foothold into the Computer parts and microphones aggressively.  Per the last earnings call: "" We will continue to expand our PC  gaming portfolio of headsets, keyboards, and mice. The additional  ROCCAT PC products we launched in the fall last year will be followed by  another wave of really exciting new PC gaming products this year. As  I've mentioned, our near-term goal is to create an incremental $100  million business in PC accessories and our longer-term goal is to lead  those PC gaming categories."" How do we know this is really what they are doing and not just simply something said to make investors happy? well if you go to Turtle Beach's website and look at the [Careers Page](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/careers/) you will see that one of the jobs is director of brand marketing - Roccat. This along with the news today that [Roccat just snagged a deal with LCS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turtle-beachs-roccat-pc-brand-123000929.html) tells me they will continue to grow this brand.

In addition to this Turtle beach is still being valued as a gaming headset company.  Look at their PE ratio - it's only 12.19 as of closing today.  Compare that to other players in the sector - Corsair at roughly 27, Logitech at roughly 20 and razer who doesn't turn a profit last I checked.  A PE of 12 for a company with no debt in an industry that will continue to grow is an amazing prospect - however their current valuation makes sense if you think they are simply making headsets which will have moderate growth in the years to come verses PC accessories.

I do want to mention some quick risks to Turtle beach as I think there are some which could very much derail the company:

1. My whole case for Turtle beach depends on them growing Roccat and Neat Microphone - either of these could fail and if that is the case they will have trouble growing at a good pace - compare this to the branding that Corsair, logitech, and Razer already have, and you have a company that should be trading at a lower PE ratio
2. Similar to above, they are a very concentrated company and the majority of their sales do come from headsets, that industry will not grow at an alarmingly fast rate, so that will stifle their growth if it cannot be addressed.
3. While the amount of cash they have for their company size is incredibly good, it is not an amazing amount of cash compared to companies like Logitech, who , if I did my math correctly, [has 1.3 Billion in cash on hand, enough to buyout Turtle Beach at their current market value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/balance-sheet?p=LOGI).
4. Following the above, In this industry moats are hard to find, while this is a good thing for the growth of Roccat, it is a dangerous thing for the Turtle Beach headsets
5. Finally, due to the company size, one or two poor moves could really derail the company, so that is something to keep in mind.

Overall I am very bullish on the company, this is not my most in depth DD (time has been tight to do a good write up), but I think I brought up most of my bull points.

Positions: Currently 46 @ an Average cost of 25.57.  I will continue to add more shares though throughout the year as I believe this company is undervalued and in a great position to grow.

&nbsp;

Basically, it is a buy and hold strategy where 3x leveraged S&P 500 UPRO and 3x leveraged 20-year bonds TMF are held 55 to 45 percent, but if we use options to hedge, you could change this allocation to favor UPRO more than TMF (70/30, 75/25, or even 100 UPRO)

&nbsp;

Right off the bat, there's a few concerns with this strategy. First, it is very volatile and depends on the SPY continuing to move steadily up. Many folks are speculating we're in a bubble that is bound to burst somewhat soon. 

&nbsp;

By far the biggest issue with this strategy is that a large drawdown in SPY could absolutely tank UPRO given that it is 3x leveraged. Last March, the fund went from ~$80 to ~$20 in just a couple of weeks, and only reached $80 again in January of this year.

&nbsp;

The inherent hedge of this strategy is in TMF as bonds are often negatively correlated to equities. During the same crash last year, TMF shot up from ~$31 to ~$47, and stayed above $40 for a good portion of the year.

&nbsp;

However, bonds increasing when the SPY decreases isn't a guarantee, so why wouldn't we hedge further by buying some puts on UPRO and TMF ~10% OTM dated a year or so out? This is particularly compelling with Volatility at a low-point at the moment. Puts at this price range for this far out would cost quite a bit, roughly 10% of total investment, but would limit max loss in the event of a major downturn to cost of puts + how far OTM the puts are (20% total).

&nbsp;

Should such a downturn occur, there's a couple things that could happen:

1) UPRO crashes, TMF goes up: in this case the gains from TMF will partially offset the losses in UPRO and you could exercise your put on UPRO and reinvest back in when the market starts to recover.

2) UPRO and TMF both crash: In this case you could exercise the puts and reinvest during the recovery. In the worst case scenario that the market doesn't recover (bear market) you would exercise your puts  and realize a 20% loss from initial investment.

&nbsp;

Given the potential returns of UPRO, it seems likely that it would be capable of generating some impressive returns, particularly if stock market is able to continue the bull-party for the rest of the year. Given the optimism around re-opening and the Fed's dovish monetary policy, this is a definite possibility. And if the market really does break? You could certainly do worse than 20% loss.

I'm sure I'm missing something about this, so before committing to this plan I was hoping to get some opinions. 

Thanks!

EDIT: The major concern I think with this, is the high cost of buying the puts. You would need for UPRO to gain 10% to break even on the puts within the next 288 days (for a Jan 21, 2022 expiration). Of course, this could possibly be mitigated a bit by selling covered calls on UPRO.",['SPGI']

mminfh,,investing,post,1617851206,"LARK seems like a good buyThis small regional bank has some nice things going for it. They’ve consistantly grown their business over the years. They’ve benefited in a positive way from the PPP business loans, most of which won’t be paid down early as companies seek flexibility. They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition. It was one thing that worried me and caused me to email their investor relations, but fidelity just has a bad newsfeed because the company is so small.",

1. Revenue and profit have been growing for the last 5 years. Even during a pandemic.
2. Free cash flow has been growing for the last 5 years, too. 
3. Net Margin is high, not sure if this is normal for bank industry.
4. Still paying a good % of dividends
5. They're paying down debts while positive in cashflow
6. Equity has been consistently and slowly growing
7. PE ratio at 6.40

Its 5-yr Av. FCF x 15 (conservative number) = **$186M**

And it''s currently being traded at **$124M** marketcap.

I like buying stock based on its free cash flow and this is a strong signal for me that they're undervalued, as long they have a healthy balance sheet.

The only thing that I don't like here is they keep issuing more shares, not crazy but slowly, which is normal for a micro-cap company. However, I stumbled down a post they started buying back their shares last year.

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/LARK.P/key-development](https://www.reuters.com/companies/LARK.P/key-developments)  
*""Landmark Bancorp Board Approves Stock Repurchase Program Of Up To An Aggregate Of 225,890 Shares Of Co""*

Based on its TTM Cashflow statement, they just bought $2,000,000 worth of shares.

I love a stock when they consider buying back their shares, imagine for a micro-cap company, because it's definitely a good sign that they value their shareholders. I love this practice from companies that are publicly traded.

I think I have enough signals to start a <1% position in my portfolio and just watch. I'll be cost-average if they're doing great. I think there's upside potential on this stock and have room to grow from acquisitions but I'm buying from its current cash flow at the moment.

Free cash flow is positive but it’s always worth paying attention to the Balance Sheet when it comes to banks (which is never that straight forward given the varying degrees of regulatory capital required), personally I like to have a decent buffer of Net Book Value v Market Cap as in a liquidation scenario the costs to collect/sell assets are going to eat into this buffer.

mminfh,gtta9d9,investing,comment,1617891696,"At first glance, this looks like a value play based on high level ratios, including P/B, but as they say, there's often more to the story than seems to be the case...

I'm just an average FP&A guy, not a superstar by any means... but what immediately stuck out to me in two seconds of looking at their financials is that the industry's Loan Loss Provision is 2.5 times that of LARK's, and on a micro cap, one small wave of defaults could put this company immediately underwater.

Consider that when BOA acquired Countrywide they discovered that a full third of Countrywide's loans were in default.  Countrywide's acquisition price was 2000 times larger than LARK's market cap.

I've got 20 years of experience in financial and data analytics, and even I don't feel confident in my valuation of banks because once you start getting into Level 2 and Level 3 assets, the valuations are so complicated that even some folks at Goldman couldn't tell you with accuracy what the bank is worth.

mmnp4v,gtsmylu,investing,comment,1617878980,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it’s not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn’t expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week’s 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

Some highlights: 

[Dimon's discussion of corporate citizenship](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#corporate-citizen)

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

>1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

mm65gx,gtqacmj,investing,comment,1617827158,"Really interesting passage here from Dimon w.r.t post 2008 banking regulation and it's impact on loans:

> To understand this in more specific terms, look at the chart above that shows, prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had $13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending (this is, in part, directly related to the new liquidity requirements) may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experienced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more had been lent, the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been faster. 

I haven't heard this brought up before but it's something worth considering.

Also regarding QE and deficit spending:

> If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quantitative easing (QE) and deficit spending averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period after the Great Recession did not result in higher GDP growth and possibly higher inflation. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 4%, which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%.

> And so why did all this QE not have the effect you would have thought? QE was never effectively tried prior to the Great Recession, and it is different from fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securities from security holders who tend to reinvest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset prices and creates some spending (through the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may have some inflationary effects, mostly on asset prices. But on the other hand, it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves, which is an input cost for businesses, and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement income). And finally, in this most recent round of QE, much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back as deposits at the Fed, not as loans.

Just in case anyone needed another explanation of why we aren't seeing massive amounts of inflation. 

In general there's a ton of good stuff in there, the COVID-19 section in particular regarding possible scenarios going forward, risks and some insight into the kind of acute liquidity events that cropped up last year and why we might be seeing them more frequently.",

But I kind of feel like he is right. We've already seen, over and over, what kind of damage banks can do when we leave them to their own devices--and that is with regulation. But an increasing amount of systemic risk is now taking place outside of those regulations.

Take a recent topic of a lot of discussion: Coinbase. As of their December reporting, they had over 90B of customer assets, which would have put them in the top 40 banks. I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

Per the S-1 ""Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock, one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $11.50 per share"" [sec.gov/Archives/edgar…](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001704760/000121390020010323/ea121129-s1_americanvirtual.htm)

With this expected runup in stock price AH because of the PR. We'd expect the same runup in warrant price, however, we DID NOT see that. Warrants are still trading below $1. Fair value for the warrants should be \~$2 (over a 100% increase from current price).",['IR']

Edit: thinking about this more, the warrants in my opinion are becoming ultimately worthless. I think people are concerned that the warrants will expire (may already be a set date not sure) and now the stock has ran and plateaued at much less than the $11.50/share mark why would you want to own the warrants?

Edit-2: and after reading this further each warrant is entitled to the $11.50/share purchase of common stock (no benefit for investors) and 1/10th of a share of common stock. So that means the warrant price should trade at roughly 10% of the common stock price... that is showing to be true",

Current price = take out price * (% liklihood that the txn will execute), e.g. there is still risk you're bearing (offer get's rejected and price drops back down to $5/share).

Warrant's expire worthless since exercise > offer price, but there might be a CoC caveat hidden somewhere in their indenture (or S1 possibly, since technically these are equity derivatives and not fixed income).",['TXN']

mm9ppe,,investing,post,1617823242,"Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sourcesBy Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.","['MS', 'XOM', 'AES']"

They're establishing themselves to capitalize on the growing fossil fuels market with decreasing competition as rivals divest.

They also have a large footprint in developing nations (see Chad-Cameroon Pipeline) and are expanding into the steady cash flow midstream segment.

Moreover, looking at their research and development, synthetic fuels (AKA efuels), although they likely won't capture much of the ICE market will almost definitely be used for jet fuels and shipping fuels. Carbon capture also acts as a great supplement to pre-existing operations while improving imaging.

And of course, that dividend and buyback program is nothing to scoff at.",['ICE']

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

mrgxr3,,StockMarket,post,1618500183,"Dear Retail Investors,My 2 cents.. Best way to learn the stock market and become efficient and proficient is to be hands on.. Skip the advertising lessons you see allover and those so called “I made millions doing this or I turned pennies into riches”... You should frown upon them.

Want to get good at stock market investing and trading? Be hands on. Learn as you go. You loose money, probably a lot of money, but you gain a lot of knowledge. You can mentally structure those loses into as a cost for “Self Taught Knowledge”.. Those loses are investments. They are not losses. Why? Well that money was destined to go somewhere. Either to daily cheeseburgers or someone rip-off instructors.. 

Instead you will be giving it to a market as a loan, knowing sooner or later, you are going to be getting it back with interest at a far higher rate than ever.

Now when you start earning profits from your mistakes, guess what, your head is going to go really up high. Why? You now have pride in achieving 2 major things:

1: Self Taught Skills
2: Earn Money-making 

You and your mistakes are your biggest instructors and your greatest inspiration, and should be your highest motivation.

Keep on riding.

ms4zz9,,StockMarket,post,1618585296,"Copper Miners cutting back on operations?!?!?!Copper is so important to what we want to do with our economy, it could become a national security problem. Copper, as a key component of the global economic engine, could see strong demand from the construction and manufacturing industries as the global economy recovers. Considering the world’s ambitious infrastructure plans, coupled with clean energy technologies, and pent-up demand for electric vehicles. As a result of this, copper miners will be forced to drastically cut back on operations! But the question is, is there anything to mine? 

We all know there will never be a deficiency of copper. Since only approximately 1.1 trillion pounds (approximately 13.6 percent) of the world's inventory of this important and valuable metal has ever been mined. Because of the advancements made in mining equipment, mining technology progress have resulted in growth and production in the copper mining industry. Copper mining has evolved from primitive, inefficient techniques to lightweight, reliable modern-day machines, making it a cost-effective and efficient operation. sponsored post. Furthermore, modern mining equipment allows for the reduction of waste and the reduction of chemical exposure at all stages of the copper mining operation.

[With that being the case, the world economy's reliance on copper will be unaffected! I can't wait to see how the global economy develops! I found this great article that I just had to share. I hope you can benefit from it like I did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPwKEXyp9jc)

They are used in the manufacture of renewable energy  technology such as high power, low weight rare earth magnets, as well as  military and national security applications. But why is it so difficult  to obtain these metals and elements nowadays? According to what I've  read, obtaining these elements has the potential to minimize the  existing political and strategic danger of relying on a hostile  situation for REE sources! Rare earth elements will play an important  role in our national security. REE is used as the main component of  night vision goggles, precision-guided weapons, communications systems,  GPS equipment, batteries, and other defense electronics.

With  the rare earth elements being in demand, acquiring these elements seem  to have rallied significantly. But what is the challenge for attaining  these elements? sponsored post. The extraction of these elements is  complicated by the fact that certain materials are jumbled together in  the ground with a variety of other minerals in varying concentrations.  Several mining companies are now on the move on acquiring the mineral  deposit containing these metals and elements! This will be extremely  beneficial to our armed forces!

ms1iui,,StockMarket,post,1618573916,"The Copper Bull Market Thesis Is Taking Shape! A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable! I Believe One Company, Torq Resources, Is Best-Positioned to Outperform&#x200B;

With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the copper market, while focussing on one company, Torq Resources, that I believe is extremely well-positioned to outperform in the current market. As always, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!  

Generally speaking, I am looking at this as a macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market.

**On the demand side**\-  Combination of global infrastructure rebuild with clean energy focus has created a massive demand for electric vehicles. With each EV requiring 4x more copper than gasoline-powered cars (\~180 pounds of copper in *each* EV) and an estimated 125 million EVs on the road by 2030, the demand for copper will steadily increase each year as passenger internal combustion engine vehicles are gradually phased out of production. (1)(2) Additionally, EV charging stations will require \~250% more copper by 2030 to meet those demands. (3)

**On the supply side**\- Covid has forced Copper miners to drastically cut back on operations. What was supposed to be a year of mined supply growth turned out to be the second consecutive year of zero growth.(7)  The gap in copper production, coupled with strong EV demand during the post-pandemic recovery has triggered a major supply problem. Consequently, analysts from several companies have forecasted huge copper price increases (i.e., Citigroup; $12,000 by 2022, Goldman Sachs; $10,500 over the next 12 months, and Trafigura Group, $15,000 over the next decade). (4)(5) 

As new mines take years to come on line (due to finding, permitting, developing, exporting, etc), this results in a relatively small number of companies that actually produce copper or have the potential to produce copper in the current cycle. 

Based on my research, I believe one company is extremely well-positioned to capitalize during this copper bull market. 

**What is Torq Resources?** (TSXV: TORQ) (OTC: TRBMF)

Torq Resources is a copper-gold exploration company focused on prolific mining regions in Chile. Chile produces more than a quarter of the world’s copper, having produced \~5.6 million metric tons of copper from mines in 2019. (6) Torq's management team is extremely well-respected within the industry, having raised over $550 million and monetized successes in two previous exploration companies. 

**Why I Am So Bullish On Torq Resources**

At a very high level. when I am evaluating junior miners, I start my analysis by segmenting into two categories:  


1. Those that reasonably could produce copper at some point
2. Those that probably will not produce

Of all the Junior explorers I have researched, I expect Torq to have the most success.   

The biggest catalyst for this success is the launch of the Margarita Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold (IOCG) project located in northern Chile. This region in northern Chile is well-known for its discovery potential - and, this particular property that Torq acquired has generated considerable excitement from geologists as having huge deposit potential due to the strength of the alteration system, large-scale magnetic targets and the presence of copper oxide mineralization along the southwest flanks. (7)  


Torq is set to begin drilling at Margarita in Q3 2021 and the early indicators could not be more positive. 

  
**Torq Resources Is Technically Attractive**

  
Additionally, from a technical analysis standpoint, Torq Resources is extremely strong. 

Since hitting its low of 30 cents in early 2020, Torq's stock price exploded to \~80 cents. I suspect it will break above double top resistance and rocket to new highs, particularly as the copper supply-demand narrative continues to gain traction in 2021.

As I said at the outset, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree, both as it pertains to the copper market in general, as well as if they too see the huge upside in Torq Resources as I do. 

Additionally, for those similarly interested in Torq Resources, I would ***highly*** encourage you to check out the below website for additional research relating to the company and all of its current initiatives.

mrutmu,,StockMarket,post,1618543435,"Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days)


These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

ms34rw,,StockMarket,post,1618579652,"Does COIN have a proper transaction fee moat?I'm skeptical of brand new stocks and thought there was a little TOO much hype around Coinbase due to it's Q1 numbers. Nevertheless, when I saw the stock dropping, I decided to get a few shares around $330. 

The main argument I see against Coinbase is their transaction fees and how transaction fees will get more competitive. I have a background in marketing and psychology, so here's why I'm not too worried. 

In marketing psychology, there's something called ""inertia"". Basically, when we're already doing something, it takes a lot of effort for us to change. Most of the time we just leave it the same. For examples, look no further than trial memberships. Companies make massive proffits off giving out 7-day or 30-day trials based on inertia. There's a good chance most people won't cancel after the trial is up, so they make some nice profits. It's the same when you sign up for a newsletter. 

With that being said, it's my opinion that transaction fee competition won't be a huge issue for Coinbase. While they may have to lower theirs a little to be competitive, people aren't taking inertia into consideration. When so many people already have their crypto in Coinbase, I believe their inertia will keep them there rather than trying to save a couple bucks.

If you want to learn a bit more about marketing psychology, inertia and some other concepts, I highly recommend books from the Wharton Business School professor Jonah Berger

In the last few months, I've been reading all sorts of books on investing and found some I really like but am always looking for new recommendations.

I started reading a lot of books on beginning in investing to understanding the differences between individual stocks and index funds. So far, I've been a huge fan of index funds for the majority of my portfolio. 

From what I've learned from psychology books as well as some books on index funds, it seems like individual stock picking is much riskier, but I'm dabbling in it a little with about 30% of my portfolio.

Gain 50x short-term.CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange that runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and enables uses to SWAP BEP-20 tokens in a trustless and permissionless manner. The platform is fast, cheap, and user-friendly. CryptoSwap Finance has many features such as farming, staking, and trading exchange that enable users to earn and win tokens. 
That is CryptoSwap in summary. In this article, we will look at the features of CryptoSwap and the problems it solves.

Blockchain and smart chain technology have opened a floodgate of innovation. With BSC, it is now possible to develop decentralized finance projects (daaps) with unique features such as decentralized exchanges (DEX), firming, staking, liquid pools, and lottery, which enable users to earn and win tokens in various ways. CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that offers these features, among others that that enable users to earn higher with the least transaction fee and high transaction speed.

Products:

1. Exchange/Trade Platform
CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that utilizes automated market-making (AMM) instead of the conventional order book. Users can trade various tokens on the platforms against a liquidity pool (LP). LP providers, who are exchange users, add funds to the liquidity pool and receives LP tokens in return. The tokens can be used to reclaim shares of funds, with a portion of the trading fees. The exchange has an intuitive user interface that even novice traders can use.  

2. Yield Farming and Staking
CryptoSwap Finance enables users to deposit and lock their funds in processes that earn rewards in CryptoSwap Finance Token (CSF), the native token. There are many pools where you can stake your funds. You can earn up to 20 times in reward with the main CSF/BNB pool. You can also stake your CSF tokens to earn a reward in other tokens. You can cash out the rewards or reinvest them. 

3. Lottery
Users can participate in the CSF lottery and earn rewards. To participate, use your CSF tokens to buy the tickets. Each ticket goes for 5 CSF. You can participate with a single ticket or buy more tickets to increase your chances of winning. The jackpot winner, whose ticket digits matches all the lottery number, earns 50% of the entire lottery pool. There is a reward for those whose tickets match 3 or 2 numbers. 

4. Voting
The decision-making in CryptoSwap is done through the voting process. The community members are allowed to propose ideas and vote on them. The cryptocurrency team reviews the proposals, move the ones with strong community support to the core level where the team determines the results, and announce it to the CryptoSwap community.

5. Initial Farm Offering
Users can buy tokens offered by other startup projects in a new sale model – IFO. You can use your CSF-BNB LP tokens to acquire new tokens. After the sales, the project gets BNB tokens, while you get project tokens. CSF tokens equivalent to half the total funds raised are burned.

Final Thought  

The above core features of CryptoSwap enable the users to earn and win more tokens. The users can also directly take part in the voting process to suggest ways of improving the project. CryptoSwap is designed to ensure that the users obtain optimal benefits.

mrngbt,,StockMarket,post,1618518757,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

**Due Diligence:**

Low Cap Stock $35.9 mil. The companies valuation is in the 10s of millions. Last ER showed they had $22.3 mil in cash and they just did another direct offering of 3,245,977 shares for $37.3 million. In 2019, the yearly Operational Expenses were the were roughly $10 mil. Means this company is walking around with an estimated \~60 mil in cash; 6x the annual OPEX at the end of 2019. Along with $0 debt.

After the offering at $1.50 the stock price went from $2.60 to $1.18. Multiple times in this past year has the stock reach $5+. Mostly from PR pumps, but the companies tech is definitely moving in the right direction rather quickly.

ASTC has signed past government contracts and this stock has multiple lines of tech that are reaching the final stages. With the type of tech that have large government contracts written all over it. Myself having a decent idea of how businesses operate from the inside and the recent news that has been released it seems to me some big moves that require large amounts of raw cash (manufacturing on a massive scale) are already in place for this company.

**Things we know:**

**April 12th** \- Closed offering of 3,245,977 shares for $37.3 million at $1.50.

You can check my profile for proof and I say with full confidence that I intend to hold this position indefinitely. I only ask that you read this report in its entirety before drawing your conclusions because **nothing about this company is as it seems.**

\--------------------------------

**PART I - DILUTION, DEBT, DOUBT**

\--------------------------------

On its surface, KemPharm looks particularly depressing. A casual glance at the KMPH chart will show you their stock price seems to know only one direction. Down.

A deeper dive into their financial history doesn’t improve their outlook either. Dilution, debt, and doubt. The triple-Ds of woe that spell out doom for any company that dares to enter the biotech arena. Their earnings are dismal and their quarterly reports are depressing. Dreary forecasts and dreadful prospects detail a dismal decline of depleted reserves and desperate delusion.

In a word… dangerous.

So why would anyone invest in this company? Better yet, why would anyone spend a single moment of their valuable time researching this company when everything they need to know is right out there in the open? Had I looked at this company a few months ago I might have come to that exact conclusion...

But on March 3, 2021… everything changed.

[**Meet Azstarys**](https://azstarys.com)

Azstarys is KemPharm’s latest FDA-approved medication specifically formulated for the treatment of ADHD. A once daily pill of **serdexmethylphenidate** and **dexmethylphenidate**. This is undoubtably decent news but, despite the medication showing promising potential, this alone wasn’t enough to convince me to make my investment.

The first glimmer of potential that caught my eye appeared, like most things about this company, in the smallest of details. If you have ADHD as I do, you may have noticed that you’ve never heard of **SER**dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate, the more active isomer of methylphenidate, is in Focalin and Focalin XR but the **SER** is a new development.

Looking deeper into Azstarys, I noted that SERdexmethylphenidate was described as a **prodrug**.

And the only other ADHD med with that designation is **Vyvanse**.

I was familiar with Vyvanse because it was my prescription prior to Focalin XR. But I wasn’t familiar of why it was called a prodrug so I decided to dig a little deeper.

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

...until I found a thread...

A thread that led me all the way back to the year 2006. A year where a man by the name of Dr. Travis Mickle made a rather important discovery.

>“Prior to founding KemPharm, Dr. Mickle served as Director of Drug Discovery and CMC at New River Pharmaceuticals where he was the principal inventor of Vyvanse®, a prodrug of amphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Today, Vyvanse is the branded market share leader in the estimated $17 billion plus ADHD market. The success of Vyvanse along with a robust pipeline of prodrugs targeting ADHD, pain and thyroid dysfunctions, which Dr. Mickle was responsible for creating, led to New River Pharmaceuticals being acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals, PLC for $2.6 billion.”

Source: [https://kempharm.com/team/](https://kempharm.com/team/)

In 2006, after tendering his resignation to New River Pharmaceuticals, the MickleMeister founded KemPharm with the sole intention of producing a plethora of prodrugs. Shortly after his departure, New River Pharmaceuticals was purchased by Shire for the bargain price of $2.6 billion. I say bargain because Vyvanse now generates around $2 billion dollars in revenue every single year.

Subsequently, Shire was purchased by Takeda in 2019 for the slightly higher price of $62 billion but this information will come into play a little later.

**So this begs the question; how did Vyvanse, a single ADHD medication, create such eye-watering returns on an, at the time, equally eye-watering $2.6 billion dollar investment?**

The answer, once again, is hidden in the itty bitty details. Vyvanse is a **prodrug** of dextroamphetamine known as **LIS**dexamfetamine. And here is where the pattern finally begins to align (after 800 words of backstory, damn).

Basically, a prodrug is a modified version of a drug that attaches another molecule, a ligand in Azstarys’s case, that renders the active ingredient inert unless cleaved through your body's metabolic processes.

In summary, **it only work if you eat it.**

This has quite a few benefits. Not least of which is a longer duration as your body can only metabolize things so quickly due to the limitations of enzymatic action. This ""gating"" effect even has the potential to reduce side effects. **Essentially a prodrug can improve qualities of the base medication.**

But the more important distinction is that **you can patent it**.

Shire already had experience with ADHD medications. They’re flagship product Adderall XR had seen monumental success but was about to go off-patent. This would expose Shire to the profit-decimating world of generics and so they eyeballed Vyvanse, being the novel prodrug lisdexamfetamine, for its brand new patent. Considering Shire’s experienced sales team and established connections, converting Adderall users to Vyvanse would likely be as easy as informing doctor’s and pharmacies of Vyvanse’s improved qualities.

**SO WHAT?!**

“So what?” I hear you ask. Apples and oranges. That’s a different drug with a different company so what does it have to do with KemPharm and Azstarys? I promise you, all of this backstory was necessary to explain exactly why KemPharm has so much potential.

\--------------------------------

**PART II - CONTRACTS, CORIUM, CAPITAL**

\--------------------------------

Azstarys will be brought to market Summer 2021 through their partner company Corium Inc.

[**Meet Corium**](https://corium.com)

The sales contract between the companies offers up to $590M in sales and regulatory milestone guarantees in addition to tiered royalty payments ranging from \~9% to \~25%. This contract was recently renegotiated from $468M to $590M with a new higher top-level royalty tier and the addition of 4 new sales milestones guarantees in exchange for $28M less on the upfront. All in all, a decent agreement. Not earth-shattering but probably good enough to keep KemPharm afloat for the foreseeable future.

**But this still isn’t enough to warrant an investment.**

Guarantees mean nothing unless the drug can sell. Sure, Azstarys is a prodrug but the performance of Vyvanse can’t guarantee the success of Azstarys especially considering that Corium doesn’t have the sales experience of Shire.

**…but what if they did?**

>“We all know that having the product is key, but you also have to have a team that can effectively ramp up the distribution in order to be a blockbuster. More than a decade ago, Vyvanse was picked up by Shire. Shire had an ‘ace team,’ led by **Perry Sternberg,** that did a superb job in commercialization.”

Source: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kempharm-inc-kmph-builds-repurposing-molecules-dan-sfera)

The current CEO of Corium is **Perry Sternberg**. The very same Perry Sternberg that spearheaded the commercialization of Vyvanse during his tenure at Shire. That alone raises an eyebrow but I invite you to go to Corium’s website and look at their “Leadership” page: [https://corium.com/leadership.html](https://corium.com/leadership.html)

Tell me if you can spot the pattern:

Robyn Lynch, Head of Corporate Strategy - **Former Chief of Staff for U.S. Commercial Business and Neuroscience Division at Shire.**

John Miller, CFO - **Former Head of Finance for Global Commercial at Shire.**

John Neeley, Head of Market Access - **Former Head of Market Access at Shire.**

Jamie Spaeth, Head of HR - **Former Head of HR at Shire.**

When I saw this I couldn't help but ask myself, ""Why the hell are all these former Shire heads now working at Corium?""

The answer… **Gurnet Point Capital.**

>Travis Mickle, CEO: ""Why are we co-hosting this event today with our partner Corium? We actually entered into a worldwide license with Gurnet Point Capital that was announced back in September of 2019. Corium is a GPC portfolio company, and they have been assigned the rights to commercialize this product for GPC and for KemPharm. \[…\] We're excited about this, because through our license process, to look for the right partner, certainly, at one point Shire would have made a lot of sense. Certainly, Takeda had their own agendas, and we are so fortunate that Perry and much of his team has landed at Corium and they've had the foresight to bring in a product like KP415. Certainly, this is the team that knows how to advance a product like this, and it's a very exciting opportunity.”

Source: [kp415-market-opportunity-and-commercialization-strategy](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-market-opportunity-and-commercialization-strategy)

Ok... **so** **who is Gurnet Point Capital?**

[**Meet Gurnet Point Capital**](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com)

Gurnet Point Capital (GPC) is a healthcare fund founded by **Ernesto Bertarelli**, former CEO of Serono.

>“The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialization and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies. It is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole.  
>  
>Consistent with the amount of capital, time and energy that it dedicates, Gurnet Point Capital will generally seek to be, over time, the majority – or at least principal - investor in each of its companies.”

Source: [https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about)

In late 2018 Gurnet Point Capital purchased Corium for a flat fee of $500 million. The former CEO, Peter Staple, was replaced with Perry Sternberg in April of 2019. But it wasn’t just Sternyburgy that came along for the ride. GPC made a point to acquire his entire team. **Specifically the team that made Vyvanse a commercial success.** So why did they feel the need to recruit this exact team from Shire?

The answer… **Azstarys.**

Obviously this has been a lot of information so let me try to summarize everything I’ve detailed so far:

1. KemPharm looks ugly.
2. KemPharm’s drug Azstarys approved on March 3, 2021.
3. Azstarys is a prodrug.
4. The only other ADHD prodrug is Vyvanse.
5. Vyvanse was made by Travis Mickle.
6. Travis Mickle is the CEO of KemPharm.
7. Azstarys will be sold through a partnership with Corium.
8. Corium is has the Shire team that sold Vyvanse.
9. Corium is owned by Gurnet Point Capital.
10. Gurnet Point Capital is owned by Ernesto Bertarelli.

The thread is long and winding but the details are out there in the open. You can look up and verify every single piece of information so far and I encourage you to do so and come to your own conclusions. But I assure you that all of this information was needed to understand this next part.

\--------------------------------

**PART III - MARKETS, MONEY, MATH**

\--------------------------------

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE PERSONAL OPINIONS —**

What follows from this point on is my investment thesis and represents the reason why I decided to make a substantial investment into KemPharm. I want to be very clear that **this is not financial advice nor a recommendation that you should invest in this company. As always, do your own research.**

With that warning out of the way, let's talk about **the stock.**

During KemPharm’s latest Earnings Call on March 11, 2021, Travis Mickle and team detailed the various changes that have taken place just in the past few months:

1. Stock relisted on NASDAQ effective JAN 8, 2021.
2. No debt as of FEB 8, 2021.
3. $77M Cash on Hand as of MAR 10, 2021
4. 28.3M Shares Outstanding as of MAR 10, 2021
5. 38.6M Fully diluted shares as of MAR 10, 2021

Source: [https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020)

All of these events occurred in Q1 and have led to considerable confusion across the internet in regards to the accuracy of information regarding KMPH. But taking these new developments into account, a very different picture begins to form in regards to KemPharm’s future.

The current stock price as of the very moment I’m writing this is $8.70.

Assuming a full dilution of all 38.6M shares that gives a market cap of \~$340M. Accounting for Cash on Hand, that means that \~$260M of this company’s worth is attributed to Azstarys, Apadaz, their pipeline, their technology, and Dr. Mickle’s brain in a jar.

NOTE: This doesn't account for cash due from converted warrants and approval guarantees which could net an additional \~$80M and bring their CoH to \~$150M. This will be clarified in the next ER.

Taking all of this into consideration, I asked myself 2 questions:

1. What market share MUST Azstarys capture in order to sustain KemPharm’s operations for the foreseeable future?
2. Will KemPharm be able to innovate with future products?

To answer the first question, I needed to gain a better understanding of the ADHD market as a whole. The \~$18B industry currently has 21 existing treatments spread across 3 primary classes:

1. Amphetamines
2. Methylphenidates
3. Non-stimulants

The current largest player in the field is Vyvanse at a whopping **13%** of the TOTAL market and **18%** of the stimulant category (class 1 & 2). Competitors like Focalin XR & Concerta comprise about **1%** each.

So we have some comparatives for market performance but I still prefer to take the pessimistic approach. My question is, what is the bare minimum performance required to simply **NOT GO BANKRUPT**.

According to KemPharm they have a projected **Annual** **Cash Burn of \~$4M** [**(source)**](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call)

Considering this and assuming a low-ball **10% royalty rate** (\~8-25% potential) with only **5% of the potential $550M** in milestone guarantees received over a 10 year period, how much market size would Azstarys have to capture in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt in a **worst case scenario?**

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE NAPKIN MATH —**

(operating expenses) = (total annual market)(required market share)(royalty rate) + ((milestone payments)(percent received))/(10 year period)

x = required market share

($4,000,000) = ($18,000,000,000)(x)(0.1) + (($550,000,000)(0.05))/(10)

4,000,000 = 1,800,000,000x + 2,750,000

1,250,000 = 1,800,000,000x

x = 0.00069 = **0.069% required market share**

This obviously relies on guesswork and doesn’t account for things like CAGR, taxes, manufacturing costs, or inflation, so let’s make it even harder for KemPharm and **double the required market share.**

So in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt, assuming they sit on their ass and do nothing until the end of time, Azstarys needs just **0.14%** of the market or **$25.2M** in average annual sales over a 10 year period to earn an income of $4M. Obviously this ignores the scaling royalty rate and any further sales milestones but I prefer err on the side of caution when making wild, speculative assumptions. Helps to keep things in perspective.

So that's the bare minimum amount that Azstarys is allowed to suck before KemPharm implodes. Should Azstarys manage to perform on the same level as the lower competitors at around **1%**  you would certainly see a rise in KemPharm's stock price even with a below-average P/E ratio. And given their partner Corium's experience with the commercialization of Vyvanse there's very little reason to believe that this goal couldn't be achieved.

\--------------------------------

**PART IV - ALL AHEAD AZSTARYS**

\--------------------------------

**It is my personal belief** that KemPharm has crossed the threshold of uncertainty and has secured the financial stability necessary to confidently pursue the development of exponentially more prodrugs.

**I believe** that KemPharm's partner Corium has the ideal combination of experience and financial backing to optimize Azstarys's success.

**I believe** that Azstarys offers unique benefits that will improve the quality of care for patients with ADHD, myself included.

**I believe that KemPharm is** **extremely undervalued**.

To view KemPharm as a company in peril is simply a matter of outdated information. It seems to me that their value is hidden beneath layers of historical uncertainty and investor pessimism which makes it an excellent buying opportunity for those capable and willing to see its potential.

The arguments that Azstarys will fail to be competitive against its competitors or generics doesn’t hold water considering the fact that Azstarys **has** **no therapeutic equivalents** [**(source)**](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process) and is patented until 2037.

An additional point is that Azstarys was approved for all ages 6 and up [**(source)**](https://www.azstarys.com) instead of just 6-17 which was a surprise inclusion upon approval and serves to further expand the potential market.

The FDA also included a section in the label with clinical data suggesting that Azstarys has **reduced impedance of childhood growth and development** [**(Section 6.1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf). This particular issue is often cited as the primary complaint from parents of children with ADHD.

Critics of Azstarys focus heavily on the obscurity of it’s potential duration **(the often referenced 30/13)** and consider the inclusion of a chart without this specific language on the label as sufficient cause for dismissal. To me, this argument comes from a place of ignorance and a severe lack of perspective. Yes, certain terms of the sales agreement are contingent on this specific language but this point has yet to be confirmed or denied.

Furthermore this language's effect on actual sales is largely overestimated. All extended release products are long lasting by design but the key differentiating factor between Azstarys and its competitors is that it is, in fact, a prodrug. And as a prodrug its primary differentiation between it and other medications is the **smooth downward efficacy ramp** as the body metabolizes the medication at a consistent rate. [**(Section 12.3 Figure 1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf)

To put it plainly, other extended release products are equivalent to a **caffeine crash**. I know this because I experience it every single day.

The more interesting takeaway is that this medication’s formula and prodrug status allows it to differentiate from not just Methylphenidate products, **but from Vyvanse itself.**

The primary criticism for Vyvanse is its slow onset [**(Up to 1.5 Hours)**](https://www.psycom.net/vyvanse-lisdexamfetamine) but Azstarys is formulated with instant release dexmethylphenidate alongside serdexmethylphenidate for faster onset. **This opens up the possibility that Azstarys won’t just be competing for market share on the Methylphenidate side but may be able to cross over to the Amphetamine side and capture market share directly from Vyvanse.**

And while I don’t assume that its performance will be equivalent to Vyvanse, it is impossible to ignore the potent combination of product and people at play. **Corium’s recruitment of the former Shire team has given Azstarys the best possible chance to succeed. Who better to have on your product's side than the very same people that made Vyvanse the leading ADHD medication in the business.**

And as a final anecdote, I have already spoken to my doctor about Azstarys and we both agree that it will be my next medication. Not because I believe in the company or want to help with sales. But because I've tried just about every medication on the market and want the best treatment possible. **And Azstarys just seems better.**

So that just leaves one last question: can KemPharm continue to innovate?

The answer… **Travis Mickle.**

While there is no data in the world that can anticipate the future actions of any one person, I have a gut feeling that there might just be some magic left in the old Mickster. I’ll end this overly long DD with a simple quote and leave it to you to decide for yourself:

>“It is akin to the Golden Goose that will just keep laying golden egg after golden egg. Dr. Mickle has stated that ‘given sufficient funds, he doesn’t have enough life left, to develop all of the possibilities.’ This is perhaps the most valuable asset that KemPharm possesses.”

 [A deep dive into Coinbase's stock - DecentraNews ](https://decentra.news/a-deep-dive-into-coinbases-stock/)

To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general. I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile. Since 2010, there were 4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years. Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and now there seems to be some correlation.

Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices. This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility. Since 2016, 7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time.

This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices. For example, you can see that volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020 but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically.

One with strong fundamentals, a decent dividend and solid growth potential. I came across MDU Resources, headquartered in North Dakota and operates as a diversified utility, pipeline, construction services company.

MDU Resources has continued to execute well amidst a challenging economy. It recently achieved near record-breaking results and has strategic investments planned for this year. I have highlighted some of the key points on my analysis below

# Company

Construction and utility provider MDU Resources (MDU) had a tough 2020. Construction projects were halted or delayed in a lot of cases, and utility stocks weren’t exactly in favor with investors during a period when growth stocks reigned supreme. Still, for long-term investors with an eye on value and yield, I think MDU is a great choice.

MDU Resources Group, Inc.’s MDU two-platform business model, strategic acquisitions, capital investments in the electric and natural gas utility plus improving backlog are its key tailwinds. Also, the company boasts enough liquidity to meet its near-term obligations.

Some key highlights on why I think it might be a good pick up for your portfolio

**Consistent long-term growth at 9.3% EBITDA CAGR and 16.7% EPS CAGR**

* Stocks with higher earnings-per-share growth rates are generally more desired by investors than those with slower earnings-per-share growth rates. This is a good sign for MDU and has a decent shot at beating earnings upcoming in early May
* Balance of cyclical and counter cyclical business with almost a 50/50 split between construction and regulated energy. this bodes well for the long run and will likely be a stable performer in the market

**Runway of attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities**

* Organic Growth: We are all familiar with the infrastructure spending bill that was passed in the UIS and MDU stand to benefit from this.
* Inorganic Growth: **MDU Resources (MDU) Arm Buys Mt. Hood Rock, Expands in Portland (**[**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdu-resources-mdu-arm-buys-163304894.html)**)** These investments will be aimed at enhancing the reliability of the company’s services, thus enabling it to serve an increasing customer base, effectively. MDU Resources anticipates its electric and natural gas utility segment to see a CAGR of 5% and expects its customer base to expand 1-2%, annually.

**Improving ROIC driven by rigorous capital allocation process**

* Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.
* A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%. MDU Resources Group's ROIC % is 6.29% (calculated using TTM income statement data).
* MDU Resources Group generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.

**Valuation**

I find MDU to be attractively priced at $31.29, with a blended PE of 15.9. This sits below MDU's historical PE of 19.4 over the past decade,

Analysts also express a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $34.33, implying a 10% upside potential from the current share price.

**Earnings**

Earnings are forecast to grow 6.74% per year and Earnings grew by 16.6% over the past year. If this trend continues, we will likely see a rise in the share price

**Insider Trading**

Significant insider buying over the last year with a majority of shares purchased in May 2020. This would make sense considering the price dropped off a cliff just a month prior. The management team knew it was a bargain and acted on the low share price

https://preview.redd.it/rrkclavfzct61.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=6667b29ff1136300b53d6be53fe77bc078af93d0

# Risks

**Biden’s Infrastructure Plan** \- While I see potential tailwinds for MDU's construction business from Biden's proposed infrastructure plan, there's no guarantee that such a proposal will pass. The construction business is more cyclical than the regulated utility business, and adds complexity risk to MDU's business model.

**Mild Dilution** \- MDU relies on both equity and debt to fund capital projects. This includes $100M in expected equity issuances this year, which will be mildly dilutive to shareholders

# TLDR

I'm encouraged by the impressive earnings it generated amidst a challenging economy. Based o some of the key factors and management guidance I see continued growth for MDU for the foreseeable future. I continue to find the valuation to be attractive and the dividend to be well-covered and safe. Consider looking at MDU and potentially adding it to your portfolio.

mqzw25,,StockMarket,post,1618433935,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 14, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC)blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

 [Should you invest in IPO's on day one? - DecentraNews -](https://decentra.news/should-you-invest-in-ipos-on-day-one/)

After the IPO of Coinbase ($COIN) yesterday, you might be left wondering if you should’ve bought it? (Well probably not, since it had a [rather underwhelming first day of trading](https://decentra.news/coinbases-rocket-runs-out-of-fuel-at-launch/)). Or maybe you bought at yesterday’s top and you are wondering if you should’ve waited a little longer before going in balls deep.

If you are in the stock for the long term and believe the company has fundamental value, then the early volatility and the risk of price drops are of less concern. But for most of us, an IPO investment is just too risky. Especially on day one. Either way, if you still consider buying an IPO, you should do your own research and due diligence.

Either way, most of the time, it's better to wait at least one day before buying a stock after an IPO.

Happy trading or holding!",

***ImgAssist AI Software Achieves 0.94 AUC After Utilizing Extensive Dataset of Images Collected During Stage 1 of ATLAS AI Project***

TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Perimeter Medical Imaging AI, Inc. (TSX-V:PINK)(OTC:PYNKF) (FSE:4PC) (“Perimeter” or the “Company”), a medical technology company driven to transform cancer surgery with ultra-high-resolution, real-time, advanced imaging tools to address high unmet medical needs, today announced significant progress within its ATLAS AI Project, an initiative aimed at advancing Perimeter’s next-gen artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools through clinical development. Perimeter’s proprietary “ImgAssist” AI technology has now been trained with more than 400 volumes of images of excised breast tissue collected during the first stage of its ATLAS AI project.

Importantly, Perimeter’s proprietary algorithm has achieved key sensitivity and specificity benchmarks, including an AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.94, which is a measure of how well the algorithm can differentiate between suspicious and non-suspicious breast tissue areas. This significant milestone supports the advancement of the ATLAS AI Project to the next stage, which involves a “reader study” to conduct an evaluation of clinician performance when using ImgAssist offline (not during a surgery) to interpret images from breast conserving surgeries. It is anticipated that the data from the reader study will support development plans to advance Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System with ImgAssist into a larger, randomized pivotal study later this year to evaluate its safety and effectiveness.

Jeremy Sobotta, Perimeter’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are pleased to reach this important milestone within our ATLAS AI project, having achieved these exciting results with our proprietary AI algorithm. We are driven by our belief that Perimeter’s novel imaging platform with AI has the potential to transform cancer surgery and reduce costs in the healthcare system.”

**About the ATLAS AI Project**

Perimeter is advancing its proprietary, next-gen artificial intelligence technology and machine learning tools through clinical development under its ATLAS AI project, which is made possible, in part, by a $7.4 million grant awarded by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), a leading state body funding cancer research. The first stage of the ATLAS AI Project involves collecting images of breast tissue samples from patients at leading pathology centers in Texas. These images are precisely labeled and signed off by a board-certified pathologist. In the second stage of the project, the Perimeter team is using this labeled dataset of breast tissue images to train and test Perimeter’s AI algorithm, and further test its efficacy in a reader study. In the final stage of the project, Perimeter intends to conduct a randomized, multi-site, pivotal study to evaluate the Perimeter OCT Imaging System with ImgAssist AI against the current standard of care and assess the impact on re-operation rates for patients undergoing breast conservation surgery.

**About Perimeter Medical Imaging AI, Inc.**

[Perimeter Medical Imaging AI](http://www.perimetermed.com/) (TSX-V:PINK)(OTC:PYNKF)(FSE:4PC) is a Toronto-based company with U.S. headquarters in Dallas, Texas that is developing and commercializing advanced imaging tools that allow surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists to visualize microscopic tissue structures during a clinical procedure. Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System provides clinicians with real-time, ultra-high-resolution, sub-surface image volumes of the margin (1-2 mm below the surface) of an excised tissue specimen. The ability to visualize microscopic tissue structures during a clinical procedure in addition to standard of care tissue assessment for decision making during the procedure has the potential to result in better long-term outcomes for patients and lower costs to the healthcare system. Perimeter’s OCT Imaging System is cleared by the FDA as an imaging tool in the evaluation of excised human tissue microstructure by providing two-dimensional, cross-sectional, real-time depth visualization, with image review manipulation software for identifying and annotating regions of interest. In addition, Perimeter is advancing its proprietary, next-gen artificial intelligence technology and machine learning tools through clinical development under its ATLAS AI project, which is made possible, in part, by a $7.4 million grant awarded by the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). Perimeter’s ticker symbol “PINK” is a reference to the pink ribbons used during Breast Cancer Awareness Month by the Canadian Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society, driving home the company’s dedication to helping surgeons, radiologists and pathologists use Perimeter’s imaging technology and AI in the fight against breast cancer, which is estimated to [account for 30%](https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics) of all female cancer diagnoses this year.

The Taiwanese company will use them in its P6 plant at Nanke in the Tainan City of Taiwan. It will manufacture 28-nanometer chips, such as image sensors, display driver ICs, and other smartphone components for Samsung.

UMC is aiming to manufacture 27,000 wafers per month at the said plant. The company will reportedly begin mass production in 2023 and will mostly produce chips for Samsung. It had previously laid out plans to invest around $1.5 billion this year to expand its manufacturing facilities.",

Since then i have been posting some of my picks here on Reddit. So far I have made 18 publicly verifiable predictions, and 15 of them were correct, which is 83% precision. 

The system actually made more than 18 predictions for the given period, but I only posted 18 of them, because I was too busy with my PhD studies. Now I have more free time and I will try to publish more picks here on Reddit.

The performance of the system does not depend on bull market. The system can be used for long and short positions. I mainly post long positions because it has higher precision than shorts (about 65%). 

The system is based on price movements around earnings announcements. For today my system recommended buying PLD today before close and it is expected to go up tomorrow. But of course, nothing is certain, there is still a 20% chance that it might go down.

But i would not suggest investing using my system. First, i would suggest following my system's predictions, and after you get to know how my system behaves making your own informed decision about my system's picks.",['PLD']

And before you ask, yes there is a correlation. I know people who use interest rates how I look at oil prices. What factors, wether economical or not, do you guys look into when considering a stock(s) to buy?

Just wanted to add that if you do not have an economic benchmark to look at or understand how the price of oil, for example, affects the market you should not feel bad.

Furthermore, WSB took important place in my life recently, so I decided to give back to the community, creating this comprehensive memeful ape-friendly GME DD 💎🙌🚀🌕🪐🌌In the process of researching GME I was able to accumulate the material into this ape-friendly long read, largely aimed at newcomers of the sub. Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!  
I have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.

My fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).

And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).

**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**

The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!

# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly

The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: ""A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return."" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.

&#x200B;

**""ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?""**

You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.

**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)

https://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65

However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,

https://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170

, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there’s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a 🌈🐻, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: ""STONKS ONLY GO UP"".

&#x200B;

**""k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?""**

Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:

https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2

I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:

**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? 🐻 with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.

**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!

&#x200B;

**""My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?""**

Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!

[\\""Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\"" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)

**""oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!""** \- an ape.

That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \[big part of the revenue\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:

[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)

As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.

As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?

They dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...

https://preview.redd.it/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1

And soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...

&#x200B;

**""WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?""**

Everything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!

By buying a big stake of GME \[12.91% currently\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.

[Many, but not u\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)

It is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‘traders’ and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:

https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a

When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  🌈🐻 HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.

&#x200B;

**""Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?""**

Dafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  


# shortz r fuk

&#x200B;

**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.

Apemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.

Oh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. 🐻 with me, this is the most interesting part.

https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7

Remember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.

For now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but

https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae

Furthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. Сounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.

Furthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?

More than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list.

mryu3o,,wallstreetbets,post,1618561474,"AMC are playing both the short and the long term game and praise the retal investors.Duh, not a financial advisor.

I loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.

Quote from the article:

*""the movie-theater chain is once again “under attack” from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales — bets that the stock will go down — rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *""*

Now, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.

If anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.

*""Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry.""* 

The heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:

*""If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he’ll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution.""*

And more importantly:

*""Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against “conventional” market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey’s Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as “apes.”*

*“My hat’s off to you,” Aron said. “I’m well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,” Aron said.*

*“I actually work for you,” he said, “and for that reason it’s a special reason for me to engage with all of you.”*

Read the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it. 

In summary:

1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price. 
2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly.
3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced.
4. He works for the ""apes"".
5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.

It was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.

If they do that, or show signs of being willing to do that, I am out immediately.  Record stores did that with iTunes.  Do not fight the Internet.  They do media distribution better than any professional organizations, even when doing it for free as a side hobby.  It's not a valuable service.  The value of theaters is NOT in making films available to the public.  Their value lies in other aspects of their business (the giant sound systems, huge screens, opportunity for teenagers to escape their parents, providing a social experience, and more) and they will coexist just fine.  If they just stick with it, it will turn out to be a good investment as it returns to its pre-pandemic valuation, no question in my mind about that.",

mrw6sk,,wallstreetbets,post,1618549012,"Tech Industry Stock Compensation or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Insider Selling (PLTR)**EDIT: TL;DR - everyone I see talking about stock compensation in tech (especially companies just coming public) or insider selling around earnings/tax season seems to have an incredible lack of context for how compensation works in Silicon Valley tech. I'm here to give you an insider perspective.**

I posted this in the PLTR sub in response to a lot of threads I saw about insider selling and complaints about stock compensation models in tech companies. Figured I'd also post it here for anyone interested in my take (as a tech worker) on these things.

Okay the title is somewhat misleading because I don't necessarily **love** insider selling, but I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere especially on insider selling and I've found there's a misconception of stock-based compensation and selling by insiders. To preface, I am a software engineer for a large cap tech company and this is my take on stock-based compensation in the tech world and some basic things that I think all people should be aware of when it comes to this compensation and the insider selling that accompanies it.

To start I'll give a little background on the way stock compensation works for people on the ground. The grunts like me who do the normal day-to-day boring coding that enables the apps and products you use. I'll be using mostly the FAANG companies as examples of established public companies and the kind of compensation you see there.

&#x200B;

**First things first: how does stock compensation work for most of these people?**

At most of these companies stock compensation is typically most heavy in the technical organizations of the company. That is to say, engineers are being compensated primarily in equity in the company in raw dollar terms, in some cases well over 50% of their yearly income. ***This difference is usually most prevalent in the first four years of employment.***

Why is that last sentence true? Because your initial grant of equity is typically one of the largest in order to ""get you in the door."" The cliff, as tech workers call it, at four years is the time at which an engineer will typically experience a net decrease in their overall income due to the fact that one of the largest grants they received expires at this time and their refresher grants are not as sizeable in dollar terms (excepting the most outstanding performers and the most rapid promotions, but these are very rare).

As a matter of fact, it's a well-known and oft-used strategy to bail from a company after your four year cliff and move to another or SIMPLY REAPPLY TO THE SAME COMPANY FOR ANOTHER INITIAL GRANT. Yes, this happens. I know people personally who have done it. You could call it mercenary behavior.

Personally, my total compensation every year is comprised of approximately 51% equity, 6.5% bonus, and the remaining 42.5% in salary (accounting for the current share price). And here's the important note about that: ***I am not by any means a stellar performer at the company***. I am at a senior level and meeting expectations well for my job and role but I am not in the upper bands of the most highly compensated individuals as a result of either stellar or lucky performance. I am well past my 4 year cliff though it doesn't matter, because I didn't begin my career as an engineer, which actually cost me a lot of money transferring to engineering. Remember those initial grants engineers get? Transfers don't get those. Point being: I am a decent engineer doing good work and my compensation is still driven mostly by equity. If I were getting much higher ratings, the percentage of my compensation driven by equity would be substantially larger.

Everything you've just read is pretty industry standard for these large caps as mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**

Isn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.

Remember above how I said that the yearly equity I receive is currently 51% of my total compensation. That's because the share price is where it is. If tomorrow the share price drops by 50%... well that would be bad. You know what would make it worse? The fact that the other load of stock I have in the company isn't vested and just dropped SIGNIFICANTLY in value and depending on what triggered the drop could be heading towards zero.

That's because the company doesn't hire you and just hand you a fat stack of stock. You vest a portion of it over time, regularly. Industry standard for many of these companies is now that you vest a grant over 4 years at 1/16th each quarter. So for me, right around earnings season I get 1/16th of each grant I've received for the previous 4 years. The point of this is clearly to keep me invested and to keep me driving for my own success by advocating for and working on the best things for the business.

&#x200B;

**What kind of stock grants are there?**

There are lots. But I'll quickly go over the one that people like Alex Karp deal with (joining a company well before going public) and the one I'm most familiar with: RSUs.

With RSUs, it's a pretty simple thing: the company will give you stock every quarter!

Okay so it's not quite this simple but close, and most importantly this is a taxable event - I'll talk about this next. The company hands you a cash bonus (basically) to buy the stock at the current market price and then you exercise that to buy the stock. Awesome! Except... you just got more income... and you have now locked all that money up in shares of your company. Uncle Sam would like a word with you about this.

With people like Alex Karp the situation is even more interesting: they are given options to the stock in the company. What does that mean? Exactly what you think it does. They are issued long call options with expirations and strikes against the stock. Alex Karp is in this situation now - he has over 60m options expiring that give him the ability to buy Palantir shares at the strike. However, the current price of the shares is well above his strike and the company is giving him compensation in the form of allowing him to buy the shares at their market rate for his strike. Uncle Sam would now like a word with Mr. Karp.

&#x200B;

**So how do these taxes work?**

My company uses a sell to cover model. What does this mean? When I am issued shares my company will simply sell some of those shares after they are purchased in order to send the proceeds to the IRS. What this value represents is the expected value of the tax I would pay on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares at the current market rate. Basically, I would sell 35% of my shares instantly to cover the expected 35% tax I would owe on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares. This is pretty straightforward and for someone like me doesn't even really register as insider selling because it's not large enough in quantity and I'm not C suite or any of that. But this is a form of insider selling that is automatic to cover taxes. Read this if you want: [https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html)

With options it's a bit different because the income to purchase the stock (the bonus) would be the difference between the strike price of the calls given to the employee and the current price of the stock. So Alex Karp's over 60m shares are currently valued at well over a billion dollars. But that means the relative income that the company provided to cover his stock purchase is almost the entire value of the stock (his strikes are really low). Now he has a FUCK ALL MASSIVE TAX BILL on the income he was granted to purchase the stocks.

So when he exercises these options and then you read about him selling a few million shares, remember this - he is obligated to pay a 37% tax on the income granted to him to purchase those shares that he can either pay with his own money, selling a portion of his grant, or offsetting in some other way.

&#x200B;

**These grants given to employees are not just brand new shares**

I've seen a bit of confusion about stock compensation specifically here so I'm going keep it short on this point - this sort of compensation is not just NEW SHARES FOR EVERY NEW GRANT!@!@!!!@@ That's not how it works. Dilution and new share issuance is a thing - but it's not the norm. If you're asking why they keep giving stock to people to work for them and that's why you think the price is dipping on things re-read this portion.

&#x200B;

**Insider selling is predictable**

Why is this? Most of these people are using 10b5 plans to schedule their stock sales. Insiders are locked out of trading their own stock or even related derivatives the vast majority of the time. That includes grunts like me. Most stock sales that I conduct are for reinvestment purposes and taxes (these are automatic). But the common trait is they all happen after earnings because that's when our lockup period expires and we are granted our new shares. That's why you see people like Zuckerberg, Thiel, Pichai, Bezos, etc. selling at the same time all the time or as a result of a scheduled release. Think of a 10b5 as dollar cost averaging but for the sell side.

&#x200B;

**Parting thought**

One of the main reasons I don't freak out when I see insider selling like we've seen here (unless it's dickhead Chamath and his SPACs which I won't touch because fuck that toolbox) is that I see this sort of sell-off all the time and because I understand a bit of the problem space Palantir is in. I actually used to work on the problem that got them to start this company while they were at PayPal: payments fraud. I also know that the industry really, really doesn't know how to handle problems like this as effectively as they think and that there are untapped places where software like this would be invaluable. Even in my own work, I can think of almost a half dozen places where this would be directly relevant to MY role in a large cap. I can only imagine the value if it were company wide.

***Also, you guys know how I look at companies that try to recruit or poach me if they're not public companies?*** When I get messages from these series A and series B folks or stealth startups I almost always go in to look at what their growth potential is. I look at it as though I'm trying to do a value investment. What is their TAM? What will it be next year? What is their current valuation? How has it changed in their funding rounds? What sort of people work there and would I expect to build an amazing company with a ton of deep value with people like that? How do their finances and board structure look to me? Is this going to be attractive to other investors? Is the product they are offering going to be the best? Can I make it that?

What do all those questions boil down to: ***WHERE THE FUCK IS THEIR STOCK GOING?!***

Because here's the thing, most grunts like me who leave our cushy large cap jobs for places like this are doing so knowing full well that we are taking a pay cut. What are we looking for? To create the deep value that is going to drive that stock value way up and offer the best product so that the paper money we are promised to get in the door turns into some real money. What drives us to make it better? Knowing that we have more paper money left on the table that we also want to be worth something. That and most of us leave jobs for paper money for problems we love. Problems we think about at night. Problems that we think will change something drastically.",['PYPL']

HAAAAAPY Friday, $COIN bagholders and Shiba millionaires (jesus Christ, we really are in simulation)!  **This week was supposed to be about why you should short $PLUG and a thesis about why you should buy 29p's with the equity at 32 (something I hinted about last week in my $NEE DD)**, but it already got annihilated on its own and took out the entire green energy sector with it, and now I think it's almost so beaten down it might be time to go long again, so that's out.  Let's see if we can't get you some of that money back, and enjoy some really bad CGI in the process instead.  This week, let's examine a company which, inexplicably, came out with a robot that can perform surgery 20 years before someone figured out how to automate the cashier at McDonald's (how's that for a checkmark for simulation theory?).  This week's examination is Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG).

&#x200B;

# What do they do?  Well, the TL:DR is they help ensure that you have to wait longer before you can collect the inheritance and life insurance on your Boomer ass parents, because it helps keep them alive.

&#x200B;

They're really more of a product than a company. (yeah, I know about the EndoWrist shit, but that's hardly a revenue generator)  They make the Da  Vinci robot surgeon that you see in hospitals so long as you live in a nicer, more gentrified part of town.  Or work for one of the Colombian drug cartels - those dudes have the best medics.  If you've never heard of it, it's basically a Swiss army knife of attachments that will cut your ass open, fix what it can (sorry, that extra chromosome has to stay), and stitch you back up, all while your surgeon deals with his raging hangover and wonders what happened after he blacked out to where his ass is really sore this morning and the security guard out in the parking lot can't stop smiling at him.  That's it.  That's all they do.  Blah blah blah proprietary software blah blah blah expensive maintenance contracts blah blah blah each attachment for the robot costs money so hopefully your hospital sprang for the clip applier attachment before they snipped that pulmonary vein.  Fingers crossed.

Also, it apparently makes pancakes. :

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Cause that's not creepy at all](https://preview.redd.it/kssh7h1mnht61.jpg?width=993&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c30426e1dd5fba779b9efdc7c524868f364120f2)

&#x200B;

Which goes to show how outdated the tech has become, since everybody knows ebelskivers are superior.

# Deep dive:  This won't hurt a bit, except for the parts where it's excruciatingly bad.

&#x200B;

$ISRG is a 95 billion dollar company that sells about 1200 ~~Treadwell Droids~~  surgical robots a year at 2 million dollars a pop, and has come up with a great scam where some of the attachments are disposable so you have to keep buying them.  God bless America.  They make about a billion a year licensing out their software for use to mitigate the fact that your doctor can't remember which cord goes into which hole, and another 700 million or so on maintenance contracts to reboot the things when they accidentally kill somebody.   They make about 4 billion dollars annually, give or take.  For a company that lives and dies by its R&D, it surprisingly has no debt on the books.  It just makes more shares when they need money.   This also might have something to do with the fact that they haven't really improved on the thing in 20 years because nobody is forcing them to innovate.   They're trading near their ATH, at 804.72 as of the time of this writing.   The biggest fundamental thing to note about this company is that they basically have no competitors.  There is a company out there called Asensus Surgical that made a run at the king, but fell so short that they changed their name from TransEnterix Surgical.  It's not that their robot - the Senhance - was bad, per se, it was just that it turned out it was only good for laparoscopics, which is fairly niche.  For the record, I like that company, but we can't talk about them here.

&#x200B;

One thing I've always hated about this company but have held my nose and overlooked was that it's PB ratio is way out of whack for its space.  The average company in the medical equipment industry averages about 5.1 PB.  $ISRG sits at 9.7.  Their PEG also sits at 6.5, which is fucking crazy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Cool.  So how much growth for buying in to the fucking robot army?

&#x200B;

Actually....none.  They made 2.64 a share a year ago, but the whispers on the street - and by street, I mean company executives - are to expect a down quarter this time around due to a combination of less hospital revenue as a result of leaving so much open bed space for the spicy flu and lower demand for elective surgical procedures - and, of course, by lower demand, I mean people being told they can't have them because there's a risk of catching a bug that you'll probably never even know you caught.  $ISRG had been rising recently on the ASSUMPTION that hospitals were going to open back up to more high margin things like elective procedures and away from things like ""leaving half the hospital empty in case 3 people catch the 'Rona"".  However, through the 1st quarter of the year, that has not happened, which means the backlog of surgical procedures just continues to grow.  ASC's (ambulatory surgery centers) throughout a good chunk of the country still haven't converted away from triage facilities yet or are closing down surgical theatres periodically to reallocate staff, and there's no real word on when that is going to get rectified.

&#x200B;

Analysts have already been adjusting their expectations for the quarter downwards in the last month.  Expectations are now a 4% drop in earnings on flat-to-slightly-up overall revenues.  $ISRG has a habit of beating on earnings pretty much always, but they've reached such a lofty valuation that swapping out Tyson Fury for a Tyson chicken and then bragging you kicked its ass probably isn't going to be that impressive.

&#x200B;

My first one since the prophetic $PLTR DD that got -700'd on February 5th before I finally deleted it and let those retards lose their asses **(I'm never going to stop saying I told you so, bitches**).

&#x200B;

The thing to note is that it's tested prices in the $81x's 3 times now (let's call it 810, because that's really where liquidity always starts to dry up), and has been rejected all three times.  And it's sitting pretty damn close to that again.  Also, every time it's tested resistance and failed, it's dropped to at least the mid 700's, usually crossing into the 6's briefly, which presently serves as strong support.  It's presently trading near its ATH's not because of anything it's done, but rather because lately the trend has been to rotate into big growth companies again, forgetting that small and mid cap plays exist.  That's all well and good, but one off quarter and you're no longer contributing to the artificial inflation of the $SPY.  This has been a  reliable quiet swing trader for me, but it's now at a crucial pivot point that's going to require a strong catalyst to continue any upwards momentum.  That's bad news for a company reporting earnings in a time when even Wall Street darlings sell off even on great quarters.  At the very least, this is a rally that is quickly running out of gas, as evidenced by reduced volume.  With them reporting next week on the 20th, the pivot point of reckoning is upon us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# My logic is undeniable (or, to summarize):

&#x200B;

* For the 2nd time in a row, an S&P 500 company that operates on the fringes of traditional growth
* Has positively ripped during this rotation from value into growth, in spite of all signals showing a down quarter and poor forward guidance as we are still in a period of Covidic uncertainty and what it means for the operating theatre
* Has no known competitors, which has not pushed them to expand into other revenue channels besides crazy expensive machines meant to cover up for how few decent doctors are entering the workforce anymore
* Is trading at a crucial resistance point that has been rejected forcefully 2 times in the past, with reduced volume each time
* IV on calls is quite pricey, but puts are dirt cheap
* If you really want dad's house, maybe make sure the ambulance sends him to Watts instead of Malibu.  Remember, if he ends up surviving the procedure, he's going to rat you out to the cops

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'm expecting a miss when they report earnings next week, or at the very least a very muted guidance.  As such, I would not be surprised to see this stonk slip all the way down into the 720-740 range before it regains some footing.  Barring some sort of catalyst, I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going to get over that 820 hump any time in the near future.

&#x200B;

# How to play it.  That, detective, is the right question:

&#x200B;

All the technical signs and oscillators are pointing to it becoming a very top heavy trade, which means it's primed for a much bigger negative breakout on the slightest weakness.    All that said, I certainly wouldn't go bear on it long-term.  $ISRG has never been one of the most violent movers, but it has a way of defying the odds, and has displayed that ability in the face of adversity for decades now.  I think if they miss next week and the stock goes into a freefall, be prepared to be nimble and cash out the put and switch back to long, even if it's not necessarily justified.

&#x200B;

# An edit:  

If you don't like the short action because of liquidity (a very valid item if you're interested in more than a handful of contracts), skip that part of it and set an alarm to go long at 725-ish.  You'll be happy with that one, too.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure I own more than a few shares of this in my managed asset portfolios and, even though my short-term outlook is bearish, am also fairly certain my fund managers aren't going to want to create a taxable event with them.  **I am just flat-out short on the stock itself, but my appetite for potentially unlimited risk is different, and I can't say anybody else should do that.**  I'm holding 4/30 780 puts that I picked up for 10-ish bucks, as well as 5/28 $800p's.  I recently sold off my 7/16 795c's for a tidy profit.   Were I less of a pussy, I'd probably buy some 4/23 780p FD's.  Actually, I might do that for fun, anyways.  But remember, I'm gambling on a selloff on weakness.  If those further out puts print, I will cover them within a week or earnings and look for a consolidation pattern (probably a week or two later) to reverse course and buy some calls for another swing up.

&#x200B;

**Word of caution:**  Buying puts on a mega tech in this environment is an inherently risky move because big money has been rotating into it for weeks now.    This is not a bet-the-house scenario.  I have about a 70% conviction this is gonna go my way, but that other 30% is pretty ugly and basically guarantees a complete loss.  And even if you do play this along with me and it prints, don't sit there and try to milk it for too long.  Some hedge fund could decide it's oversold at 735 and eat away at your tendies.  Fuck that guy.  And then go buy one of these, because fucking him is legally perilous and he might fight back - the robot will never say no.

ms51jy,guqv9vm,wallstreetbets,comment,1618593439,"Thank you for sharing. As a robot surgeon myself, maybe I can give back some love by giving my opinion on the matter.

First of all, it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you 've certainly done a good job about that, which gives you more credibility IMO. Maybe not the hangover part but still.

Speaking long term, this company is here to stay. The technology they offer is second to none.  The ease of operating, what we can achieve, it really is world changing. Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot-assisted and not laparoscopically anymore.

They have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable, big maintenance contracts, and a new model every few years (so they did improve, actually, and continue to do so); support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one.

They have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar. Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent  it, mostly because robotics are quite expensive. They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on, but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills. However, sorry to offend, but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical.

The only reason why not everyone is using the robot already, is exactly this, that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position, and so it really is expensive to use it.

I believe that at some point in the future, another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards. IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R&D and not be swallowed by Intuitive. For me, Medtronic is the best bet for this (or maybe some Chinese company). This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery (and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive); on the other hand, it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top, they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field, and continue to grow from this in the long term.

It is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery (it has a lot of oncological applications, but even some of those got postponed), also put a hold on congresses, training programs etc. and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now, but probably only momentarily. I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price, but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead (which in retrospect, I should have done already a long time ago). In the meantime, I am long Medtronic as well. Not very wallstreetbetsy, but I believe these are both good plays long term.",

Barrack did terrible deals and bought every real estate property under the sun, including Michael Jackson's pedo lair Neverland Ranch. 

The shareholders got fucked as the share price went from $12 in 2017 to under $2 bucks in 2020 and the dividend went away. 

But now, the stock is at $6.7, up 40% in the last 3 months alone. What happened? 

Enter Mark Ganzi. Super stud. 

Ganzi became CEO, Tom's no longer chairman and the company pivoted to a brilliant new strategy. 

No more boomer hotels and healthcare properties. Enter the digital age. 

They started selling all the crappy real estate deals Tom bought and started investing heavily in digital real estate. You know, data centers, towers, all the infrastructure necessary to 5G all those PornHub 1s and 0s straight to your mom's basement. 

This company has so much potential, and Ganzi has done this before. He has the experience and connections in the digital space to make this thing go over $10. Also, he gets a $100 M bonus if the stock stays over 10 for a couple of months. 

As of now, all the big boys are jumping into this and institutional ownership is up to 86%. Plus, we got a couple of shorties to squeeze, about 13% of the float. At a 52W high, they're all feeling the pain and will have to close out soon. 

Do your own DD, but the momentum is there, the business opportunity and the experience of Mark G are there. It's still early to get in, this is a $10+ stock at minimum.

ms76oi,,wallstreetbets,post,1618591449,"MSOS YOLO and DD - Why I'm betting on next week to change the game for cannabis in the United States# Trying to be the Prophet of Profit

There's been a great deal of talk, trading and speculation about the cannabis sector in the past few years. Over the past few years and more interestingly few months we're seeing a staggering increase in legalization of recreational cannabis in the united states at the state level.

More importantly keeping a close eye on the activity of the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer there is a continuous promise of reform legislation being introduced ""soon"". Soon is a dangerous word and this is an invitation to time the market.

Normally don't ever try to time the market like this. I'm a big believer in leaps on principle. From a few key data points being vast increase in legalization legislation at the state level and the echoes from Schumer's twitter feed about the very soon incoming reform legislation I'm finally ready to make my bet.

If you've kept up on the posts of my sub(I will not mention the name of my sub because that's not the point. I just needed a place where I knew my posts would NOT BE REMOVED.) you'll see I'm pretty consistent about watching Schumer's moves and also the new state legislation. All the news is good news. I want to cover one data point that I haven't really mentioned in the past. Schumer in 2018 introduced the MORE act. It obviously didn't go anywhere with McConnel running the senate but this is a very different situation. It is my firm belief that Schumer will actually do what he says he's going to do. The interesting data point about MORE act in 2018 was that it was introduced on the most meme date: April 20th.

I think Schumer is going to be apart of the meme and reintroduce legislation on this day next week. I also expect to see more robust edition of the legislation that handles many of the concerns of both the right and the left with regards to gracefully transitioning to a legal cannabis market.

Schumer Wyden and Booker worked together to build something so I am concluding that it's extensive, robust and addresses concerns around the war on drugs and the effects on POC in the United States.

There are some concerns around risk of the vote passing and avoiding it going nowhere due to filibuster. After doing research on the senators on the right wing and also watching unexpected support for the SAFE act I am now convinced that the legislation will be passed in the Senate this year.

I have covered every concern I've had about cannabis in my past posts be it on my sub largely or on r/wallstreetbets. If you want to see some of my DD go look for it. I'm not cross posting or linking them.

# My Expectations

I expect the announcement on the 20th next week and a sharp price movement upward. The following day there may be a selloff as there are always scalpers to shake out the FOMO buyers. I expect the price to either stagnate or slowly rise until the legislation ultimately pass and then a sharp selloff of 10-20%. This will be the day traders / short term traders exiting for profit.

I think it's fair to expect at least a 25% increase in the price of MSOs and relevant ETFs that carry those holdings. (MSOS and some yolo holdings). Yes I'm speculating and no that isn't a math-derived number. MSOS currently sits at $40. It has taken hits over the past few months as pretty much the whole market.

I think the whole sector will jump but ultimately non multi state operators will see a brutal selloff depending on what's in the bill. My expectation with the legislation is that MSOs and smaller competitors will be the greatest beneficiaries. POC and people who want to enter the sector on a small retail end will be considered in the bill as they historically were a target of the war on drugs and will likely see special consideration in the bill.

Why?

Licensing isn't going away. This bill will not make a 'wild-west' scenario where anyone can enter the market. Licenses aren't free and aren't unlimited. Each state will control who has a license to interact in the sector. This isn't new and I'd be completely shocked to see any reversal of this trend. More so the states are ultimately going to be in control of all of the rules give or take a few federal stipulations.

# My Bet

If you've followed my posts you'll see I'm already very long on MSOS and the industry as a whole. I will get calls for either May or June and hold them for a bit. I will before the final vote is taken get some puts. I expect the sell off so I expect to ride it up by entering calls before announcement of the legislation and getting puts before the vote as I expect a selloff. This will also help me insulate my self from some of the risk of holding a completely one sided position.

I simply don't have enough money to exercise all of the calls I can buy so I will be selling a large portion of the short term ones after announcement. The strike on my long calls will be around c50 or c55.

# In short my play

* Buy calls before week ending 4/16 (expiry either May or June depending on risk and price)
* Sell calls after 4/20
* Buy puts before the final vote is taken in congress
* Close puts after vote confirms legalization
* Buy shares with any profits I've made

Here's my current positions as I don't know exactly when I'll enter my new calls. obviously I'm doing it today.

mre3bi,,wallstreetbets,post,1618491419,"AMC filed with the SEC its promise not to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized in 2021 - but what does this really mean?TLDR at the bottom. 

The CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC that AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by shareholders in May. 

Happy to report that as of this morning AMC filed [Statement 14A](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e5d2e721-c60b-4f74-9f90-7e970a8fc426.html) reiterating exactly what AA said in the interview: 

 
>**Adam Aron**: We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can’t announce intentions and then not carry through it, we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.
 
>. . .
 
>**Adam Aron**: If we need to raise some cash in the short term, remember we already have 43 million shares that are out there that were authorized in the year 2013 that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that’s a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven’t made any decisions yet.

This is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise. 

But, the emphasis is on cautious. First rule of sound investing - read the fine print. That’s how they screw you. 


>Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or facts [listed above] materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained herein. **Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.** Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.

Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen  they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can’t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don’t want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares. 

**STAY DILIGENT AND DO WHATS BEST FOR YOUR WALLET**

Seen many people switch to an automatic “yes” on their vote. I won’t be one of those people. 

I’m not an advisor or your advisor, financial or otherwise. I’m just a guy with thousands of AMC shares who likes to read the fine print and make weighted decisions based on facts. 

Full disclosure - I sold a third of my April 2019 shares in January to recoup basis and take profits. The rest is in for the ride as it’s all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible.

TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise. Bad news they can still issue more shares if the situation gets worse this year. My “no” vote stands.",

ms1a47,,wallstreetbets,post,1618572930,"Norwegian Air ShuttleHi All

Been a lurker for while, after the whole GME scene I have been looking at stocks myself lately and wanted some feed back on Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS). Its a low budge carrier and has been through a bad patch with mismanagement.

But all that has changed recently with a management restructure, see link below.

https://travelweekly.co.uk/news/air/ex-ryanair-director-lands-new-role-at-norwegian-air

Also a restructure plan allowed by the Irish courts.

https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/norwegian-air-wins-court-approval-for-restructuring-40244734.html

This could lead to a huge share prise rise, however I was hoping for some feed back from the experts on Redditt. Any feed back would be much appreciated.

Other transport based shares like Rolls Royce and IAG have seen their share price fall over Covid. My guess all will see a rise in share prices once lock down is lifted across the European continent.

mrpky1,,wallstreetbets,post,1618525214,"PLUG is incredibly oversold and way under current stock valuation... And why it's going up at least 100%.PLUG is down over 60% from it's ATH. The renewable energy market was overbought and PLUG needed a pullback, similar to TSLA/NIO/FCEL/etc.

Bad News:

It got hit with an accounting error because of their auditors, KPMG. PLUG (mainly KPMG) has to reinstate it's financial results from 2018 to 2020. This caused investors to lose trust and tumble the stock into way oversold territory. Most analysts summarized the accounting issues to appear as minor but short-term worrisome, and there's limited near-term upside until resolution. This issue was 1 month ago when PLUG was trading around $48. It's nearly fallen by 50% since then.

Multiple law firms, primarily lead by ""Gross Law Firm"", also announced a class action lawsuit against PLUG. Causing it to drop ~10% more. Looking into Gross Law Firm, that's their entire business model, suing companies on behalf of shareholders on stocks that aren't performing well enough. In April alone they have opened up 9 new lawsuits against varies companies. Records show that most are settled out of court or completely dropped. In 2018 Gross Law Firm also opened a class action lawsuit against Tesla and look where TSLA is now.

Good News:

Wall Street already grossly underestimates the hydrogen energy sector. Currently Wall Street is valuing Hydrogen Energy to be roughly 1% of the world's energy. But forecasts show by 2025 it'll be between 5-12%. PLUG is the leading green energy hydrogen company. The O&G industry has reduced lobbying against Hydrogen Energy and is joining the sector: Chevron and Shell joined the Hydrogen Energy Council last year, and Exxon this year. The transition to Hydrogen Energy is starting to explode.

Last week PLUG was invited by the US department of defense to apply for a new $520 million loan guarantee. This news was still overshadowed by the accounting errors and hasn't reacted fully from it.  Upcoming news from the Biden administration will show they are ready, willing and able to provide strong support for hydrogen projects, increasing the valuating of PLUG.

Upon receiving approval from the DoE, PLUG will utilize its electrolyzer, liquefaction and distribution technologies to deploy the first resilient network of zero-carbon hydrogen production facilities across the United States. The facilities will have a combined liquid hydrogen generation capacity of approximately 180 tons per day. 

Let's review their balance sheet. PLUG also has over 1.3B of cash on hand. 1.6B in current assets and 800M in other assets. It has roughly ONLY 236M in current liabilities giving PLUG a huge advantage to invest in future energy projects mentioned above. OR settle any accounting issues, fines, or lawsuits. BABA (45x larger company) settled a $2.4B fine and the shares JUMPED 9% because investors were no longer worried, uncertainty was behind them. When PLUG reinstates it's accounting issues the stock WILL jump. Also, PLUG's 2021 financial reports have no errors and do not need to be reinstated. This is a problem in their past they need to solve.

PLUG also already has major contract supply deals with many top companies, including Amazon and Walmart, which are also current investors of PLUG. PLUG is working with Walmart to provide it with fuel cell-powered vehicles. There are plans for expansion of this deal sometime in 2021.

Looking at current analyst's price targets, 69% (ayyy) of analyst say BUY, only 1 (6%) says to SELL. The LOWEST price target for PLUG is $29, nearly $3 lower than today's close. The HIGHEST is $78, just a few dollars short of its 52-week high. Average is $57, which is 115% upside. Read this again... the lowest... price target... on PLUG... is $29. That is HIGHER than its current stock price.

For those who care about TA, even with over a 500% 1Y gain on PLUG, PLUG has just reached oversold territory based on a RSI of 30. For shorter term traders: the 4h and 1h are also hovering around 30. The Stochastic lines have crossed in every time measure, and it's entering an uptrend off the lows of today. Even if you don't believe PLUG long term, there's potential for a quick gain as this flies back to its support of $28-32 in the week or two.

TL;DR: PLUG is grossly oversold and will bounce back to around $30 in a couple weeks. Good news is being overshadowed by an accounting error and when that problem is settled, PLUG will fly. Average price target is $58, but my price target is $75 by EoY. Based on cash flow, Biden administration push for renewable energy, clean energy sector growing, and PLUG's plan for Hydrogen production facilities and vehicle research/production, PLUG can easily hit that $75 price sooner.

Positions: I've already purchased 60k in $25 and $30 strike calls expiring 1/2023. I plan to increase that by another 40k soon. If PLUG hits the average analyst price target by January of next year, I'll close my position when it crosses $500,000 value.","['AMZN', 'WMT', 'TSLA', 'CVX']"

ms81qo,,wallstreetbets,post,1618593922,"Crunching some numbers on Moderna (MRNA) upcoming cash windfallI have had my eye on Moderna (MRNA) for a while and I decided to crunch some numbers on their upcoming windfall of cash from vaccine sales.  Let me start with I am not a financial adviser, I am just a lowly engineer who likes numbers.

**MRNA**

Projected sales for 2021 $18 billion (from MRNA last Quarter)

Projected does sold in 2021 600 million to 1 billion

Price per dose $32-$38 per dose depending on how many you buy.

Just using these numbers MRNA will gross $19 billon to $38 billion.  This gives us an EPS of $46-$96.  At its current price the P/E ratio would only be 1.5-3.5!!  I know I am not figuring in costs but they cant be that bad.  I would guess $2-3 billion to ramp up production?

Moderna reports earnings on the 5th of May, I expect this to be a total blowout from what I can see above.  

So why is the price so low still?  I am guessing that the fear of something going wrong with the vaccine  is still priced in.  If something goes wrong it would be catastrophic but so far so good!  I have yet to see any zombie reports...

  

**Why I am investing heavily in MRNA:**

\-I believe in the company.  I am double vaccinated with Moderna and everyone I know that had it had very mild side effects.

\-I believe in the science of what they are doing with messenger RNA.  

\-Booster shot sales in the future?  AIDS vaccine?  CURE FOR CANCER??

I found absolutely nothing about that, but here's what I *did* find. 

Tilray, [who owns Privateer Holdings](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2019/12/17/tilray-closes-merger-with-privateer/amp/) already sells their cannabis brand ""[Marley Natural](https://www.marleynatural.com/)"" in California, Oregon, and Washington. From the website: 

>""Currently available at select locations in CA, OR, and WA in accordance with local law. "" 

Want to confirm Tilray owns the brand? Check out their December investor presentation report. https://ir.tilray.com/events-and-presentations/events 

It's all the way at the bottom, and the ""family"" of brand logos are at the top of the report. Look for the lion. 

So, Tilray currently sells weed in 3 US States, but are still allowed to be uplisted? As I said before, I'm an APHA long, so I'm **all for it**, but still...wtf? Am I missing something?

mrp48r,,wallstreetbets,post,1618523773,"Is this post motivated by my own personal agenda? Yes. Yes it is, but this RKT play also makes sense so it's worth getting out there.I watch lines move all day, but this is not financial advice. Truly, do what you will with this info. 

RKT has been seasoning for nearly a year. It has had time to establish a suppressed trend, and now it's time test new highs with a new trend very soon. This could also be last time to get in before the new trend establishes a higher floor. 

We should know the company's fundamentals are solid at this point, just find all the DD on it and read up if you don't. They make bank and continue to innovate RAPIDLY. I've been in through it all since IPO. 

**To more pressing matters, I believe there is a large option profit possibility here.** 

I believe whales are trying to make a lot of money off of options with RKT. They tried last week and failed. This week has more attention so I yolo'd 200 calls before the bell today - $23 strikes were 15 cents each. It closed at 22.76 today.  Max pain was well below 22.5 today, and shorts got wrecked before close. I am up 33% on those calls already in 5 seconds (for now). 

I am putting this out there because we'll need roughly 50 million in volume to gamma squeeze this bitch (see picture below for open interest at $23 04/16). **That's half the float in volume, but only double the daily average**. When it went to $43 in March we did 368 mil in volume. 

There is 21k in open interest contracts at $23 calls 04/16s. There was a 10.5 million buy AH today (see picture). I saw another 89,920 share buy at 22.76 16:36:13 time stamp as I am typing this. Money is flowing in...why? My best guess is that the stock clearly is undervalued and institutions want to start making money on it sooner than later as they have been accumulating since IPO. 

Due to the small float, this stock MOVES parabolic on volume. Great company as we know at this point, but the stock sucks most of the time. It's constantly suppressed, but on the days it's not boring, those green candle sticks sky rocket on a 90 degree angle like there is no tomorrow. Meaning...options earn profits really really fast. So if it happens, don't get too greedy because theta will burn your options quick. I am hoping for a 25.5 - 27  per share to exit my calls with hopes of exercising. If it doesn't start early in the day, then ill probably roll my calls over to next week.

To make this happen - we need a catalyst (which is a possibility big money knows something), or we just need some retail help when the attack begins. Fair value IMO is $65, but I'll take somewhere between 25-30 before earnings. Lifetime PT $350a share by 2023. 

Just an FYI: this stock is notorious for false hope so expect the worse and hope for the best. I believe the low is $21 with a absolute worst case unlikely scenario of $18. So if you don't want to eff with the weeklies I would start buying shares here because it may not see $22 much longer and it's low risk to buy shares here IMO.  I also very confident in my June calls because they crush earnings every time - this will be their official 4th reported earnings as a public company.  I would anticipate that they want to leave the market will some fire news so that they utilize market cap for larger market share. RKT was never supposed to be a one hit wonder.

mrjjyo,,wallstreetbets,post,1618507632,"HYLN Pt. 2: A Fair WarningHey guys, I posted the DD about HYLN yesterday that got some traction on WSB, and I'm back with more insight. I tried posting this new discussion on both WSB and WSBOG right after market open, but it seems that my account has some issue with posting new threads -- none of my posts ever go through without mod approval, despite being added as a [contributor to the sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7l0p0/gme_disinfo_exposed_1_why_the_gme_moass_post_that/grburu2/).

Anyway, this time I'm posting about why you should be **wary** about short-term hype surrounding HYLN. I know that may shock you after yesterday's post, but read on -- you'll probably feel like I'm preaching to the choir, here.

# ...What?

Let me start by saying that I believe in the potential of this company -- its *long-term potential*. This isn't a short squeeze, this isn't a quick turn around, this isn't a few dollars you throw at some FDs. This is a stock with a **real** chance of going gangbusters in the next few years.

I've noticed [posts celebrating](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrdeqb/hyliion_moon_time/) HYLN's premarket rise. HYLN is *often* green premarket and then descends into the fiery red depths of hell slightly after 9:30am. This is a common market manipulation technique: it's ***easy*** and ***cheap*** to buy stocks up during premarket/after hours because the float is so low, so it doesn't take much to push a stock up. Then, once the stock starts off high, and retail FOMO in, that's when the big boys dump the bags on you. **Premarket and AH mean jack shit.**

So why am I warning you? Because I've noticed some really suspicious activity since posting yesterday. I feel I owe it to you to let you know what I've noticed. Also, my parents raised me to be incredibly honest. Not gonna lie, it's a bit of a drawback sometimes, but like George ""Motherfucking"" Washington, I cannot tell a lie.

Also, this isn't entirely selfless -- paper hands sink stocks. I want you guys to know what you're getting into. I want you to know what we're up against. I want you to know why it's important to be in it for the long haul (haha trucking joke, get it?)

First, let's talk about APU.

# High APU Rating

This is something I wrote about in a previous post about [GME disinformation](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbh9xe/disinfo_exposed_2_how_hedge_funds_and_useful_apes/) that wasn't permitted on WSB: the APU ratio (Awards Per Upvote ratio).

I ran some numbers for the typical amount of awards for every upvote for randomly-selected posts from different categories of posts:

* Posts by DFV
* Pro-GME posts (during the period when it topped out the second time -- 1 month ago)
* Pro-silver posts
* Pre-GME DD posts

[You can see the results here.](https://i.postimg.cc/8zqqPrHx/Awards-Per-Upvote.png) I chose these categories, because I figured DFV's posts were a decent representation of organic posting in WSB -- they're easy to digest and impressive enough to merit awards. They're probably on the higher end of what an authentic post could expect to receive in terms of awards on WSB. When compared to pre-GME DD posts, you'll see that my theory stands correct: DFV's have an APU ratio almost 10x higher than pre-GME DD posts. DFV's post had an average APU of 0.0323.

I also looked at pro-silver posts, because there was a consensus that silver sentiment was being manipulated in WSB. It's no coincidence that silver died immediately the day after after media started pushing a misleading narrative that ""Silver had become the next GME"" ([Source](https://i.ibb.co/8bpLNv0/slvscam.png)). I noticed that silver posting had an APU higher than DFV's posts. The most upvoted pro-silver post had an APU **more than 3x DFV's average APU, and much higher than even his highest APU ratio.** Pro-GME posts were similarly high.

I ran some numbers on my own post yesterday, after someone raised this same suspicion.

The APU for [my post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqrfzf/hyln_how_we_got_here_where_were_going_aka_the_moon/) was abnormally high. It's 0.0664, which is...:

* twice that of DFV's average
* higher than a random selection of 10/11 of DFV's higher-upvoted posts
* almost twice that of pro-GME posts (during a time of what I believe was ongoing astroturfing and positive sentiment manipulation)
* much higher than that of silver (though admittedly I used a small sample size)
* over 10x that of pre-GME WSB

Now, it's important to qualify this: taken alone, this data could just be merely coincidental. There's a lot that can explain it: gracious HYLN owners finally seeing their stock get its dues, random weirdness, etc. Taken alone, this data might not mean much. So let's contextualize it.

Let's look at...

# Suspicious social media activity

The [exact same user](https://i.ibb.co/KGRGKjt/censored.png) kept rewarding my post -- 9 awards over 7 hours. How often would you stick around 7 hours to award the exact same post?

Okay, not enough to be conclusive, but...

[Look at his account page](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png). Lots of warning flags:

* Extremely low karma
* Posts exclusively in WSB
* Has an award for gilding so many goddamn people
* Formed Jan 27th (which corresponds to a lot of pro-hedgie activity, based on my observations)

Okay, now in context the picture is starting to become a bit more clear...

Here's [one even better](https://i.ibb.co/HK5xhfm/shillbot.png) \-- this is what these guys like to do. They give a stock pick, give an extremely specific date. ""BUY TOMORROW IT'S GONNA EXPLODE"" and then the next two days the stock craters 10%.

I feel a bit like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat when I say shit like this, but do you think I'm making this up? [Think again](https://i.ibb.co/56LJp04/shortbot.png). If you (weak, puny, individual investor) buy, it's easier for them (hedge funds, billionaires, shorters, shitillionaires) to sell into your buys. They get a better price to short at, *and* they get to shake your paper hands.

In all honesty, I made some pretty good money finding these shills and inversing them. Even still, I tried to warn about them before, but my post was censored. This level of disgusting control and manipulation just does NOT sit right with me. If this thread is what helps expose this manipulative bullshit, I don't really care that it sacrifices a money-making strategy that I've used to 100% success up until now. Fuck hedge funds, basically. Fuck billionaires trying to shake a few cents from the little guy.

For the record, any time a poster whose name starts with ""**Ad**Something####"" (for, y'know, ***advertisement***) starts getting bullish on a stock, that  freaks me the fuck out. Especially if they only have a 2 month old account. Look around with a critical eye and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Oh, and remember yesterday in my posts when I talked about an account on Stocktwits that shitposts about HYLN literally all day every day? Well, [he's back](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty7200), and I can confirm that, based on his posting style and patterns, that's definitely him. Curious he came back the exact same day I made the HYLN bullish post, no?

**tl;dr:**

**HYLN is still being manipulated. Wouldn't be surprised if it continues trending down for the short-term as it shakes out weak paper hands. Think about why. I'm holding this stock until something FUNDAMENTAL changes about the company. Day-to-day red and green doesn't change my thesis. Paper hands get shook.**",

mrw2fi,,wallstreetbets,post,1618548474,"Rite Aid ( RAD ) Got Slaughtered When Earnings Were Released - Was It WarrantedOK, OK, OK --- I know that Rite Aid had a bad Q4 due to the spike in COVID-19 infections that kept a large portion of the nation on lockdown, the reported weather and logistics issues, and most of all the weak cold and flu season (--Hey, everyone stayed home and wore a mask when out, so no one got sick with the cold or flu).  OK, Q4 is now in the rearview mirror, and the stock is trading below $18 per share.  Is that price warranted?  Some points to consider:

1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars.  Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?

2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million.  This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.

3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year.  Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid.  This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings.   Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.

4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up this month leading into the earnings announcement.  On March 31, 2021 the short interest was 15.1%.  Not the highest we've ever seen, not by a long shot.  However, shorts are becoming more agressive in recent days:

* April 15th - 1,571,592 shares shorted (25.69% short volume ratio)
* April 14th -    379,924 shares shorted (16.61% short volume ratio)
* April 13th -    700,706 shares shorted (30.70% short volume ratio)
* April 12th -    135,778 shares shorted (15.36% short volume ratio)

5) Bartell Drugs acquisition just recently closed.  Unlikely to contribute to net earnings during the current fiscal year, but is expected to do so next year.  The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.

6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.

7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year).  For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).

8) Break-up value of the company is likely in the range of $40 - $50 per share.

Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $18 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?

mrfyuh,,wallstreetbets,post,1618497335,"AMC DiscussionRecently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:

1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down
2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.
3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.

Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.

P.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.

Edit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things:

1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now.
2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger  and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff). Plus, people have been binge watching netflix the whole pandemic, by now they are probably ready for a change. 
3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal.

Have a bit of spare change left? Consider buying some cattle, whose drop in the last few days does not make sense in light of faster economic growth and higher feed prices. 

[June 2021 Futures](https://preview.redd.it/6e9ns0kpbdt61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7e8427c27f04cc3e75c42e700a162fcf97aa08)

1. For cattle, the most important factor quite honestly is the supply. More cattle than what is demanded (domestically or internationally) means subdued prices. Right now, this is the primary driver, as [young calves raised in late 2020](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/cattle-beef/market-outlook/) in anticipation of economic recovery in early 2021 are showing up on the lots. As of right now, demand is OK - just OK with Americans coming back to restaurants, even though the rest of the world isn't. Like what was driving oil prices (up to yesterday when the IEA upgraded all forecasts), the rest of the world is significantly lagging the US in recovery. 
2. Feed prices are critical to cattle as well (namely corn and soybeans). These have been on a tear in the past few weeks due to fewer than expected planted acres, and the current cold front across the midwest. If the feed becomes too expensive, it becomes more costly to fatten cattle, making less available to market, especially for the June contract as the time to fatten is now. 
3. The backlog is about to end. The massive oversupply has been in play for about 6 months already - from October to April. Every commodity has seen the same cycle post-pandemic - a massive depressing of prices, only for the entire market to realize they've been too pessimistic, and then sudden rally. 

&#x200B;

It seems like cattle is one of the last agri laggard - corn, soy, hogs and lumber have already punched through the roof. I'm heavily in corn gang, but overall I'm bullish all soft commodities. Buy a few contracts and see what happens, and I'll be sure to report back when I find 18 metric tons of beef on my front porch.",['ES']
