nanrlu,,stocks,post,1620823410,"I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

(TYT.L,TM) said Wednesday that it is committed to making battery electric vehicles or BEVs. It expects to sell about 8 million electrified vehicles globally by 2030, of which 2 million will be battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.*

*The company expects battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles will make up 15% of U.S. sales by 2030, and along with the company's hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 70% of the Toyota and Lexus combined sales mix will be electrified by 2030.*

*Earlier in 2021, Lexus unveiled the LF-Z, a conceptual look at the future of BEVs in the luxury segment. That was followed by the debut of the Toyota bZ4X concept, a battery electric SUV that will go into production in 2022.*

---------------------

Two million EVs AND fuel cell vehicles in 2030 is an absolutely shockingly low number. Also, who do they think they will be selling these 6 million hybrid vehicles to? By 2030, EVs will be significantly cheaper than hybrid cars due to the expected battery cost decline of 60-80% this decade. Why would 75% of their customers pay more for a worse product?

nbchqt,gxyp65o,stocks,comment,1620903053,"i think its fair to say that 2030 is a somewhat conservative, but really realistic timeframe. 

if anyone really thinks the markets , infrastructure, customer sentiment will change in thenext 2-5 years, they need to wake up. 

central europe - as an example - probably has the most advanced and stable electrical infrastructure in the world. yet, its nowhere near capable of supplying an ""all EV demand.""

and its not the charging stations that are lacking (well, not only them) but the infrastructure needed to supply enough charging stations. 

add to that the battery issues of longevity, performance fluctuations depending omn temperature levels, recycling of batteries, limited materials for those batteries... 

there needs to be significant improvements in all of these aspects to be made for EV to really provide an alternative. 

the environmental impact of EV´s - compared to ICE cars is far worse. EV´s will not be the end all be all solution to the planets eco- and energy problems. 

EV tech and TSLA as the flagbearer - in my personal oppinion- is nothing more than a wakeup call and proof of concept that a whole indusry COULD change faster than expected. if enough pressure is applied. 

if enough pressure would be applied, we would find even better eco-friendly alternatives in a ""heartbeat"". but society, politics and industrial lobbying simply does not apply enough pressure.","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

Tomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.

The government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.

Now let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.

You remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.

The SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.

So, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.

You've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks.",

nbeuca,gxz1icz,stocks,comment,1620910927,"If you're asking why Alibaba earned 22bn in Net income and is trading at 26pe ratio with 30% growth and it's down the reason is below:

People aren't focusing on the PE ratio or the fine. It's because a lot of their profit comes from investment income.

We've gone from a bull to bear market, and China is watching Alibaba's investments like a hawk.

Another company that also has lots of income from investments is Softbank who reported their results too.

Softbank's Net income was a whopping 46bn for the year - which is higher than FB and GOOGL.

But why is it trading at just 135bn market cap? Because of that 46bn income, a lot of it comes from trading other companies. Their vision fund segment. It's not income that consistently repeats itself every year.

They made like 40bn alone from that segment. Their softbank business - the one with recurring income, made 7.7bn before tax and their ARM segment made a loss.

Alibaba made half of their income from recurring operations and half from investments. So their PE based on their consistent, recurring income is 51.

What multiple should the investment side be? 

For softbank, if we calculated based on their total net income their PE is just 3. But no one calculates based off investment returns repeating. If we base their PE on the recurring income, its closer to 20.

That's why you can't use straight PE for companies that make significant amounts of money from investments. Investment side of the business, PE can't be more than 20 IMO. Probably closer to 10x for an average return year. A killer quarter (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), investors don't push up the price as they don't expect super good years to repeat itself.

Just for reference, Alibaba non-operational income over the years: 51, 10, 27, 48, 79, 80. It can jump all over the place throwing out PE ratio.","['GOOGL', 'FB', 'MS']"

Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I’m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought. Thanks in advance. 

Basically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company’s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. 

But with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I’m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don’t see how much more they can reasonably fall.

nb00oc,,stocks,post,1620855109,"How bad do we realistically expect this dip to continue?I have a lot of tech stocks (please no lectures on diversify. I know. But I can't diversify when my holdings are thousands in the hole).

Anyway, my biggest holding (dkng) has gone down virtually 10 straight trading days. 1 of those were green but by 13 cents so not much of a gain there.

The problem is, I've been using margin to average down because I honestly did not expect it to get this low. I'm now pushing margin limits and need some expert advice. What to cut.

My biggest bag holders in order are...

DKNG (-23% down, $54.89 CPS)
PLTR (-19% down, $23.11 CPS) 
SFT (-15% down, $9.16 CPS) 
PINS (-13% down, $65.95 CPS)

DKNG is 55% holding, PINS is 22%, PLTR 8%, SFT 5%

Needless to say, DKNG is the problem. I'm holding a lot and it's down the most. I used to believe in the stock, but now I don't know what do believe.

So my question is...

Do I just cut the cord and drop dkng before it drops to $20-25. Do I cut PINS? I can get rid of PLTR AND SFT but that won't help my margin deficit much.

Or do I continue what I've been doing and shaving 10 shares at a time off either dkng or pins when margin gets close to max and just hope this crash stops soon?

Serious suggestions please. No lectures. I know my mistakes. I just need to figure out the best way to mitigate my losses.

Note - I don't need this money right now. I have another non-margin account that I never look at because I have all the time in the world for the stocks to rebound. But I'm racing against margin on this one so I'm wondering the best way to handle it. Thanks",

nb8ht6,,stocks,post,1620880539,"Mat Ishbia called out in Feb Q4 earnings that he wanted to payback shareholders. May Q1 he delivered on the regular div and buyback.I have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1 earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while competitors are lagged.

During   the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on   the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:

The    Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid   on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And    so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet  is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and   we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change    the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,    those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

May Q1 Earnings Quote:

As    you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of     $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a     record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded     share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward  shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share  buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

Then in answering a question from an analyst

Doug   Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you   mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about   kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?   And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal   teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy   and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the   float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we    have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm     going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:    UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to    shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a    buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they    can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that  it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. At current    stock price levels the CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 23K shares of UWMC",

nbjloz,,stocks,post,1620920556,"$INVE disrupting NFC, most recently in Needles & Cannabis[Identiv (INVE)](https://files.identiv.com/brochure/Identiv_Brochure.pdf) is a Nasdaq listed small cap growth stock with a solid core business and huge growth pipeline as a leading innovator in Radio-frequency identification “RFID”, particularly Near-Field Communication “NFC”. Identiv designs and manufactures millions of low-cost RFID chips that enable the internet of things “IOT”, offering highly tuned and optimized antennas, systems, software and security. Identiv has been selling [smart ID and perimeter access card systems](https://www.identiv.com/products/physical-access-control/hardware/freedom-access-control-hardware/) to institutions including the [federal government ](https://www.identiv.com/us-government-ficam-solution/)for many years, and is now seeing high growth in [other verticals](https://www.identiv.com/products/rfid-nfc-inlays/hf-inlays-tags/) such as [prescription drugs with CVS](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/cvs-pharmacy-app-introduces-feature-people-visual-impairments).

I expect compound annual sales growth of over +20-25% for several years with huge near term upside driven by opportunities in high-tech syringes and cannabis (particularly Canada). The company has recently launched a Developers Kit to help customers find more use cases, for which INVE can prototype quickly. Over the past year, manufacturing capacity has increased +70% from 130 million units to 220 million units, and [management has commented recently](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) “That's not even a lot of buffer for what we're seeing as our baseline demand”.

As of 5/12, the stock is trading at $14, a valuation of 3x Enterprise Value / 2022E Forward Sales of $120M. With high visibility for 20-25% sales growth, I believe the stock today is worth $26 based on 5x Forward Sales. If Identiv delivers on their pipeline of smart syringes, cannabis labeling and other innovative products, sales will exceed $250 million by 2024 and the stock will trade \*significantly higher\* than where it is today. As the world gets more digital, I expect INVE will sell billions of NFC tags configured for [countless applications](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/the-need-for-enabling-touchless-technologies-whitepaper.pdf).

**Recent updates on Needles --** INVE’s customer is awaiting FDA approval for smart syringes for which they are targeting 100 million units from INVE with an average selling price of $1-1.50 = $100-150 million opportunity. [Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), “Now these are super precise auto injectors for cancer, autoimmune and other treatments that have to be dispensed in exact amounts, at the right temperature, at the right dispense rate and exactly the right needle insertion. In this design, we're incorporating multi-sensor features, including temperature and fluid dispensing measurements, as well as authenticity and data protection.""

**Recent updates on Cannabis --** INVE is also well positioned to capture market share for mandated [RFID tagging of cannabis](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/tag/rfid/) in Canada and [potentially in the USA](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981126/0/en/Identiv-to-Showcase-NFC-Solutions-at-WestPack-and-First-ever-Cannabis-Packaging-Summit.html) in the future, which is a 1 billion unit opportunity in Canada alone. [Per 10K](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-012914/) – “Governments can track the quality and authenticity of cannabis products for compliance and especially for tax collection”.

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), ""So, I think, the cannabis one you're referring to which is in the public domain, there's a big opportunity out there. And we mentioned that we've provided sample rolls to them sample products. It's very far along, but it's a government program. You would think they'd want to drive it as fast as possible, because it's going to increase their tax collection capability and certainty. But government programs go with the pace they go. So, it should be hitting in the relatively near-term. But again, with us, if we say it's going to fall in the third quarter or fourth quarter per se, and then it pushes out, that can change expectations. So it's on track, and we're comfortable with the position. We're in there. And it's moving along and they're taking samples and assessing it, but exactly when it becomes mandated is not certain, give or take three to six months.”

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) ""Back on this cannabis, 1-billion-unit opportunity. It almost sounds like you sort of won the technology bake out there. Is that a fair characterization? Or is that still going on?""... ""In terms of compliance and ability -- so the short answer is, yes. But to be clear, being a government program, it won't be sole source. Are we pretty -- well, I wanted to not overstate anything, because nothing's been awarded? But, we're certainly at the forefront of those who, more than comply, you completely satisfy everything they're looking for.""

I personally think, that if from China to the US everybody is on board with changing the energy production to renewables and the strong development of the sector despite the pandemic in 2020, it should be very likely, that we see at least a strong decade for renewable energy stocks.

While researching what stocks are best positioned to profit from Governments trying to make a switch in energy production and at the same time are relatively stable during inflation and rising interest rates, I came to the conclusion, that I wanted to invest in companies that are already profitable an so well financed, that they are able to pay out dividends.

While the US market is relatively small for such companies, countries that are more advanced in their energy production do have some stocks that fit. Europe, Canada and China are clearly ahead in renewables and I would love to get some inspiration on where to look for more companies like this.Also I would be very interested in feedback on the stocks I have come up with doing my own DD.

naz3qf,,stocks,post,1620852757,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 12, 2021PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 12, 2021

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown.

Everyone started saying “buy the dip” and “it’s on sale!” when a stock dropped 4-5% and it sounded like a good idea to make back a quick 5% once the stock recovered. However the dips kept coming and every 5-8% drop I kept “buying the dip”.

I now realized how 5-8% is barely a dip and I should’ve waited for at least a 10-15% drop in price before buying more. Now I’ve got little capital left to buy at these 30-50% drops from ATH and I just gotta weather the storm until (hopefully) these climb back up. Lesson learned.

nbh8fn,gxz9cq1,stocks,comment,1620914749,"The percentage is better because you will be able to buy more shares of the one that pays .70 cents for the same investment amount as the one that is paying more at a flat rate and thus you will still get more money each quarter.  The percentage is the percentage of your investment amount that is coming back to you in dividends.  If you bought $10,000 worth of the stock you would be getting $1,000 a year in dividends from the 10% one and only $200 a year from the 2% one.  However there should be a lot more that goes into your decision besides which one pays the highest dividend like which one is safer, which one is more likely to increase their dividend, which one is more likely to go up in value etc.",
nbh8fn,gxz9gec,stocks,comment,1620914795,"Div payout and div yield are related, but div payout is more accurate. Div yield changes literally every day, because it's tied to the stock price, which always changes. If a company commits to the same quarterly dividend throughout its fiscal year (which is common), it might be a 4% yield at the beginning of the year but turn out to only be a 2% yield by the end because the stock price doubled. By looking at the div payout, you know exactly how much dividend to expect for that year/quarter/month and can calculate yourself what that yield is in realtime.",
nbh8fn,gxz8xij,stocks,comment,1620914556,"Depends on what you can invest and I would look more into the company rather than just % yield.

A 10% yield on a $5 stock is different than a 10% yield on a $50 stock. The annual $ amount is per 1 share. IMO it is easier to calculate annual dividends with the actual $ amount. 

# of stock shares x annual $ yield = annual dividend

It just simply ""disappears.""It may seem like a ""no brainer"" to most people but stocks don't work this way. A move 5% higher might have happened over 100,000 share volume and 4 weeks of time. The following move 5% lower can happen with 10,000 share volume over 2 days time.

nbkhuc,,stocks,post,1620922841,"$DGX Undervalued and now even has a Short Squeeze playI've been posting ongoing analysis for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics) for the past 3 months. Not allowed to link, so see post history for additional **non** short interest related deep dives. Although the returns have already been excellent during this time, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.

* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective, Days to Cover is below 1 for both G.M.E and A.M.C.
* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.
* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:
   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.
      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.
   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.

**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = ""Retail"" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.

**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can run. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock based on their financial position alone). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's also too large to simply be a hedge. **See previous DDs for non short interest related analysis.**

nbjhdx,,stocks,post,1620920242,"Dividend vs growth comparisonAlright, so I am mostly in VTI/index funds but have some dividend stocks as well. I know some people say that dividends don’t make any sense because stock drops in value and you lose growth. I was trying to figure out how much I would lose in my dividend stocks so I did a very very simple math exercise below. I kind of proved myself wrong here. 

Can you guys take a look and let me know what I got wrong?  I am assuming 15% tax bracket and I am assuming that other growth is identical between these stocks. So I am not factoring that in. I am just reflecting the dividend portion. 

1.  Let’s say I want to start living off dividends from some of my stocks in 10 years. Let’s say I have $100 and invest in a 5% div stock and I reinvest it all. But I pay 15% div tax rate every year so I only get to reinvest 4.25% and the other .75% gets lost as tax. 

100*1.0425^10 = $152. So I have $152 and I will start taking my 5% dividends. 

$152*.0425 = $6.46 income per year after 15% div tax. 

2.  Now by contrast I invest in a stock that doesn’t pay 5% dividend. So everything else being equal it just grows by 5% every year. 

100*1.05^10 = $163.  Obviously higher than $152.  But I then have to sell this growth stock and move it into a dividend stock to start living off my income. I realize long-term capital gains tax which is the same as dividend tax so 15%.

I now have $163*.85 = $139

5% of dividends minus 15% div tax is $139*4.25% = $5.91

If someone is looking for the possibility of fast money, they can choose “growth.” If someone wants more security, then they can find companies which grow and pay a dividend.

I think there is a pretty good chance we will see a market slump that lasts into summer.  People will likely freak out about inflation.

nbbf1o,,stocks,post,1620892801,"Would it make sense to buy SQQQ now while the market is hot and flip it into TQQQ after a crash?I’m just thinking about it. Everyone says we’re in an all time raging bull market. It’s great. Everyone’s making money.

I’m thinking of throwing a few grand into SQQQ and just leaving it there and forgetting about it.

Eventually the market has to crash, right? Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this month or maybe not this year. But eventually.

Based on looking at how it performed in previous crashes it would definitely end up sitting lower than it is today if there is a serious crash.

I’d think it would probably result in some losses in the immediate future. But if I just put the money in and left it there, essentially considered it forgotten and never touched it...

Basically I would think of it as an insurance payment. If the market does crash and it effects my stocks then the losses would be balanced out by SQQQ gains.

In a minor crash like the COVID crash from March last year it would be like a 9 bagger. In the event of a major crash it would be a 100 bagger.

So if I put in for example 5k right now and just left it alone the worst case scenario would be that I lose some of the 5k. I could even buy it slowly and keep buying it to keep a good dollar cost average.

But then if there’s another minor crash like last year that 5k would become 45k. If there’s a major crash (complete devastation)that 5k would become 500k.

Thinking one step further, if it became obvious that the crash was over, I could flip whatever gains into TQQQ and then slowly ride the wave back up.

I haven’t made a decision yet but I’m having the overall feeling it would be a good idea.

However I’ve only been investing for a few months so there’s also a chance that I’m wrong about this and potentially overlooking some factor. It seems like it’s almost too good of an idea.

I would like to know everyones thoughts on this, please.",

Many people think for example that a certain asset class that shall not be named has no real value while stocks have real value because you own a piece of a value creating company. (just an observation, not the point of this discussion) 

My question, why does having partial ownership in a value creating company has value in itself? I would think that that value only exists if that company pays a dividend or if we assume they will at some point start paying a dividend back to it's owners. 

So let's say I take my company public but the issued shares will never be able to receive a dividend. Would that mean my shares have no real value, thus following popular believe should be prices at zero? 


Disclaimer: I own and I'm a fan of both asset classes mentioned above.

nbf8j1,gxyxqf2,stocks,comment,1620908827,"Look at shareholder equity. In a way too simple format, assets minus liabilities. Because it's a real, tangible business, it has real, tangible assets. Cash on hand, revenue, infrastructure, whatever you want to call it.

As a shareholder, you're a part owner of this business. Not symbolically, it's yours. If the company were to liquidate all assets, pay off all liabilities, and close up shop, you would be entitled to your share of the proceeds. Thus, businesses, and shares, have real value. You can calculate the precise amount very easily, and it's on all financial, stock based websites. Anything beyond that is speculation, but that's not a bad thing by any means.",
nbf8j1,gxyxmwm,stocks,comment,1620908770,"Assuming that there are no super voting shares held by founders, shares priced too low (your example of $0) would present an arbitrage opportunity for a willing investor to purchase a controlling interest to distribute profits or dissolve/distribute, etc. this would create demand for shares, putting upward pressure on prices until that arbitrage opportunity no longer exists. 

That’s why it’s important to understand fundamental valuations. 

However, I do not understand why investors buy companies with dual class structures that award founders with super voting majority and no plans to ever distribute proceeds. So I can’t help you there.",
nbf8j1,gxz7fo1,stocks,comment,1620913860,"The notion that a profitable company will never pay a dividend is your problem.  Unless you had a company where an insane inside owner wanted to run it into the ground there is always the possibility of a future dividend.  Lets say that this non-dividend paying company which is profitable and has real returns has its price drop because everyone agreed that no dividends meant it was worthless.  There would be intense pressure from the board to do something about that like maybe declare a dividend.  If the company was still severely undervalued there would be takeover attempts or mergers or something where other investors or companies tried to get a hold of this business that was generating profits.  That new entity could then start issuing dividends.  The reason companies that are profitable don't issue dividends is because they feel that the money used for dividends can be better spent on growth or stock buybacks or acquisitions etc.  Worse case scenario that money is just piling up somewhere that it can still be unlocked later when management changes.  If any entity decided to buy up all the shares and take it private they would still get all the money that has been piling up as well as all of the future earnings that they could keep and would essentially be paying a dividend to themselves.  This is what gives that company value because there will always be people willing to buy a profitable company and take it private it it was cheap enough.  The fact that they would also have to buy your shares to do this is what gives your shares value.  The fact that people will compete to do this is what keeps that value from dropping too far below the intrinsic value of the stock.  Sure you could come up with an example of a company where enough shares are controlled by a crazy person to make that not possible but then just don't invest in those companies.

On the other hand your other asset is only worth what people are willing to pay for it and if people no longer wanted to buy it it would be worthless and even if you could buy 100% of the outstanding shares/coins (and essentially take it private) they would still not be worth anything.  

&#x200B;

It isn't the dividends that make it worth anything (that is just the easiest way to extract the value) it is the profits which is real money coming in that are waiting to be used as well as the prospect of future profits in ensuing years not counting as you mentioned the assets the company holds.",

Hell, someone involved with the fed says one sentence they don’t like in an interview and they sell like crazy.

They sell off of RUMORS of these kinds of things happening.

My question is, what is the point in big firms selling the most successful companies in the history of the world over such small things that have happened countless times before?

Some back story on me, I am a 20 year old real estate investor who sold off his stock portfolio at 18 when he got into real estate. However, I fully intend on re-entering equities no later than by the time I am 25. In the mean time, I’ve been doing research on different companies (fidelity, schwab etc) and different investment strategies. So far, I am leaning towards choosing fidelity as my brokerage. HOWEVER, this reduced interest thing sounds like it could be hugely beneficial to me as real estate will always be a large percentage of my portfolio.
What I’m asking for is for anybody to share any expierences they’ve had with either this specific Schwab program or with the company in general.
Specifically, I would like to know:
1. Is there a limit to how many discounted morgages you can carry?
2. Is 20% down adequate for these loans or would you have to put down more to reap the full discounted benefits?
3. What is the approval like for this program? Is a 720 credit score adequate? Do you need above average DTI ratio or other metrics?
4. In general, is this program worth choosing Schwab for, assuming you take full advantage of it?

I’m planning to have above a million in assets invested in whichever brokerage I choose at some point in my life which would qualify me to take advantage of the .5% off morgage rates. I doubt I will reach the 5 million mark, but you never know!

nazxmk,,stocks,post,1620854899,"Royal Helium - $RHC.V discovered a large amount of helium under 2 wells and are one step away from production on their third well!!!Royal Helium - $RHC.V discovered a large amount of helium under 2 wells and are one step away from production on their third well!!!

Today it was finally confirmed. 

A quote directly from Royal Helium’s CEO 

“Andrew Davidson, President and CEO of Royal states, ""we are exceptionally pleased with this discovery at Climax. The Regolith appears to be helium charged over a significant interval and, once the production methodology is determined, it has the potential to be one of the largest helium discoveries in Saskatchewan history.”

Royal Helium - RHC.V one step away from production 

“Production planning will commence shortly on Climax-1, with the intent of producing and monetizing the helium, CO2, and nitrogen gas streams. Discussions with potential processing partners are underway and Royal will report once a gas processing agreement and off-take agreement(s) are in place.”

*A drilled helium well, once all the testing is complete, can start producing almost immediately. 

Royal helium plans on using a membrane system in order to filter the various gases from the well. Helium, being the smallest molecule, will be the gas left over in the end. The system is relatively small, about the size of a C-can, and the gas can be loaded directly from the wellhead.

Basically, Royal helium intends to use a transport truck which will carry a number of large cylinders. They intend to fill the cylinders at the wellhead and then transport them to a plant in Montana. The drive will take approximately 4-6 hours. Also, NA helium has a processing plant right next door.

Another method of generating revenue will be for outside companies to bring in their own equipment and purchase their helium directly from the wellhead.

This will also open the door for other Dynamic revenue sources, but at the time of this writing, I was not able to find more details.

The revenues generated from these first 3 wells will be used to finance the drilling operations on further wells, hence creating more revenue and starting a snowball effect. Royal helium estimates that it will take 6 months for a well to recover its cost of drilling and testing followed by 9.5 years of profit per well.*

The train is about to leave the station to the rocket pad. $RHC.V, at 56c a share, is a steal and it won’t last long.

There is now a tremendous amount of upside and very little risk. What else would anyone be looking for in a penny stock!!!",

This is also making the price of cars soar and people on a budget will probably just wait it out to buy since this is supposed to be over by 2022.

nb1rqy,,stocks,post,1620859804,"Rigel PharmaceuticalsRigel Pharmaceuticals is a relatively small biopharmaceutical company that has had many positive developments in the last year; everything from stumbling upon the key to stopping the hyper-inflammatory Covid-19 disease state in its tracks, to recently having one of its drugs validated as a strong potential cancer therapeutic, to entering into a substantial co-development deal with one of the largest pharma's in the world Eli Lilly. Rigel has 3 drug programs it's actively working on including Fostamatinib, IRAK1/4 and RIP1 that are all in various stages of development. Below I'll be addressing these programs, some financial data, and price targets.

**Fostamatinib in ITP and WAIHA:**

Fost has been FDA/EMA/Canada approved for the treatment of ITP; an auto immune disorder that destroys blood platelets. Net sales in 2020 were $61m and RIGL expects those sales to grow in 2021. Israel approval expected Q2 or Q3 of 2021. Japan ph3 also just completed enrollment so approval is potentially on the horizon there as well.

Fost is in a late stage 3 study for WAIHA; an auto-immune disorder that destroys red blood cells. Expected enrollment completion late Q3 2021. There are no other approved treatments for this disease and RIGL had strong ph2 results. It is orphan designated which will also amount to a quicker review by the FDA.

**Fostamatinib for Covid:**

Fost was found by the University of Amsterdam to prevent Covid-19 cytokine storm by actively inhibiting spike proteins which are believed to lead to an over-active immune response that especially compromises the lungs. Further, it was found by Harvard and MIT to be the only FDA approved drug (in their 3700 drug database) to inhibit Mucin-1 which is elevated in Covid-19 as well as other non-Covid indications such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonias. When this research was brought to RIGL they took it to the National Institute of Health and the Imperial College of London who found it compelling enough to begin two separate investigator sponsored trials (1 completed) in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. At the NIH as well they conducted a study by which a process called NETosis was occurring in these patients. Little is really known about NETosis or how it effects various covid and non-covid disease states but it's suspected of leading to and causing systemic thrombosis. (NETosis is when neutrophils are spliced and release their extra-cellular DNA into the blood serum which then binds to available proteins to form a fibrotic net-like structure to stop pathogens) At the NIH in their study when they applied neutrophils to non-covid and non-severe covid patient blood serum only a few neutrophils activated but when they applied neutrophils to severe-covid blood serum the entire dish turned green indicating something in that serum was activating every neutrophil. In a follow up study they then applied fostamatinib to this serum and entirely prevented the neutrophil destruction and DNA release from occurring. Additionally multiple other studies have also helped shed light on fostamatinib's role in preventing Covid platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Further the Department of Defense is paying for the lion's share of Rigel's phase 3 Covid study which may potentially lead to a substantial purchase by the DoD as indicated in the contract. See below.

NIH Phase 2 Results using Fostamatinib in ICU Covid-19 patients. 0 deaths, reduced ICU stay by 4 days (from 7 to 3), reduced adverse events by 50%, pulled fully ventilated patients off vent within 7 days, all biomarkers favored Fost over SoC. EUA being pursued.

**RIP1k program:**

Eli Lilly is co-developing RIGL's RIP1 program. RIGL received $125m upfront payment from Lilly this April, along w/ $835m in potential milestone payments, and royalties ranging from single digits to near 20% based on RIGL's involvement. Phase 2 studies expected to be launched this year. RIP1 is indicated in large CNS indications which Eli Lilly specializes that a relatively small pharma like RIGL can't undertake alone without substantial funding.

**IRAK1/4 program:**

RIGL has completed phase 1 studies and preparations are being made to begin phase 2 studies this year. Today RIGL saw a spike in price share due to data released by another company (Curis) where in a small cancer study of 9 patients all improved and at least 1 achieved complete remission status. It's expected the data readout will validate other IRAK inhibitors such as RIGL's IRAK1/4. Multiple other studies have found a number of indications in both Irak1 and Irak4 that RIGL may pursue.

**Outlicensed (partner-sponsored) trials**

Rigel has an extensive drug discovery program and has out-licensed a number of drugs that are currently in development. Rigel is entitled to substantial milestone payments and future stepped royalties (ranging from 5%-10% of net sales). RIGL often nets $20-40m annually from these agreements.

Trades take 2-3 days to settle. If you hold a position for longer than a business day, upon selling, the proceeds plus any gains or minus any losses will be made available for you to move into another stock. 

Hold it less than a business day, and the cash will have to settle.",

The past few weeks i've noticed rather odd values and charts in my tradingview desktop and phone application. Settings were maintained, none changed.

1. Im either missing the shaded areas for after hours or premarket for various stocks, sometimes the same stocks everyday, sometimes it changes.
2. I was missing an entire day's worth of SPX last week. 
3. Afterhours/postmarket values don't match anyone else I've contacted that has tradingview. I've also referenced other chart/value websites and mine still differs. 

Here are examples from today:

The most notable one was today for Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock. 

[Berkshire Hathaway Class A missing shaded areas for afterhours and premarket. 1 minute chart. The share price is also quite different than every other source I've checked, including friends who have tradingview. Seems like im missing VIX and SPX days on that chart too.](https://imgur.com/SNjpOUX)

This happens pretty often, the data feed isn't great for pre/postmarket. Often won't show up until the next day or at all.

>I was missing an entire day's worth of SPX last week.

This is a lot more unusual, I've never seen that... I would report it to them for sure.

>Afterhours/postmarket values don't match anyone else I've contacted that has tradingview. I've also referenced other chart/value websites and mine still differs.

This is probably due to TradingView using CBOE for their data, it is very similar to the major exchanges but not the same (I think CBOE amalgamates trade information from a number of different places).

If you're paying for a plan, you can pay an additional $2 for the good realtime data for each exchange (the option is located on the account billing page), and this will probably resolve most of the data issues you're having.",['CBOE']

That being said, I need to understand more, and I was hoping for my questions to be answered on here. Take note, as you can guess from my questions, I know nothing about the field. The chart i'm using for oil is here [https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/)

So here are my general questions for oil:

**- If oil prices rise/drop, what happens to oil stocks? My guess is if oil prices increase, certain stock prices, such as $USO increase along with it. Is it bad if oil prices increase? Right now the price is at $65. If it goes to $66, what would happen to $USO, and what would happen to a gas company, such as $BP?**

**- What should i be looking for in terms of news relating to oil, and what type of catalysts can cause an increase in an oil stock's price, or more importantly (to me) a decrease in an oil stock's price?**

**- What stocks, outside of gas companies, oil rigs, and anything that produces/distributes oil, is heavily reliant on oil?** 

**- The Biden administration has made it clear that they are trying to steer the US into ""green"" energy. What does that say for the near future for oil/oil companies?**

nax03r,gxwvrgu,stocks,comment,1620860216,"The whole story probably won't fit into a comment, but here you go:

There are upstream, midstream and downstream plays.

Upstream are the companies who extract the unrefined oil and own the reserves (shell, BP, Chevron, Exxon, etc.).  Midstream are the pipeline guys.  Most midstream companies (Kinder Morgan, etc.) are undervalued at the moment, but they are also mostly structured as Master Limited Partnerships.  Great long term dividends but unless you are investing enough to use an accountant, you might want to stay away from the additional tax paperwork or put it in a Roth IRA where the taxes don't matter.  Downstream is the refiners (Valero) and the end product (gasoline) sales (Exxon, Chevron again).  

'Super majors' in this category are companies with all their fingers in all the pies.  While you may think these are profitable investments no matter the price, they actually suffer quite a bit if the oil per barrel price gets too low (even though they can technically sell a bit more gasoline); they have to shut down fields and it's really expensive and can't be restarted at a whim.  They've poured billions into finding and extracting, refining crude oil but certain oil fields were acquired several years ago with the anticipation of higher prices (back when oil was +$100 per barrel) so there are massive legacy costs involved - essentially, they overpaid for the reserves given what the cost per barrel is today.  Not all crude can be extracted or refined the same way - crude from Saudi is a light, sweet product that is easy to extract and refine, crude from Alberta, Canada is much heavier, harvested from tar sands and much more expensive to refine.  You can't send one kind of crude to another plant without a heavy, multi-billion dollar plant revamp, they have different processes, so you're locked into which plants and and pipelines you can use (also, there are contracts, etc.)

There is a whole ecosystem of companies who also serve the industry.  Like Fluor, which engineers the large plants.  Ship tanker and trucking companies that move the final product.  Steel companies that benefit from the construction of plants.  Heavy haul companies like Mammoet.   

Then there are the chemical and gasoline plays.  If the cost per barrel goes up, jet fuel costs more and airline stocks take a dive.  If the cost per barrel goes down, chemical and plastics manufacturers (Dow/Dupont, BASF) will do better because their raw material costs go down.  

All of this isn't even touching LNG (liquified natural gas).","['KMI', 'DOW', 'CVX']"

The problem w Green Energy is that it currently ONLY works w huge subsidies.  Take California Wind Farms.  90% of them built only a few years ago are running but obsolete.  Older ones are being torn down.  On their own, without Government giving the developer either Hard Cash to build them or HUGE tax credits, they don’t stand on their own.  Ecologically? Yes of course green energy is better than coal.  But it’s not perfect either.  Wind Farms kill birds.  Solar is super inefficient and super expensive and makes the land it’s placed in utterly unusable for any other feature.  Wave energy and Nat Gas has issues as well.

I'm 28 and as many others also have I have started to be serious about investing in the stock market with savings accounts interest rates so low. I'm UK based and can invest 20k/yr within an ISA wrapper to avoid taxes on capital gains. 

I own a house, have approx 220k on my mortgage which has a locked in rate of 1.84% for the next 4.5 years. I have student debt of approximately 17k at 1.25%. I don't have any finance on cars etc. 

I have around 25k in savings and have kept back 10k as a rainy day fund so have 15k available to invest. 

I was originally planning on buying in at around £500/week in various funds to try and avoid lump summing it and then markets tanking (like they seem to be potentially doing currently!) 

My time horizon is initially around 7-8 years when I plan on upgrading the house, then long term towards retirement. Currently working full time in a secure job.

I realise I'm really lucky to have this opportunity to hopefully try and invest my money wisely but it seems there's a lot of uncertainty currently with post Covid recovery/inflation etc. My risk tolerance is fairly high I feel but probably hard to say until you experience it). 

Over the past few days there's been a fairly big tech sell off it seems and a lot of panic/fear. 

Would anyone consider a different approach to averaging in my money over the next 6 months? Would you put a decent lump sum in after corrections downwards? Any advice greatly appreciated from those more experienced in the markets than myself! (I realise I have to make these decisions myself and you can't give officially financial advice, just a bit if brainstorming.)",

As I understand it, inflation especially hyper inflation isn't a bad thing at all for a stock holder.
If your fiat of choice evaporates you wanna hold real values, like real estate or art, etc.
Why? Because they hold an intrinsic value that's not bound to a currency. And this is also true for stock's. So why fear it? 
I mean if you hold a large chunk of cash you should be scared of inflation and get rid of it.
Selling stock's because of inflation fears looks counter intuitive to me.

The only things I see here are that high inflation means the end of the endless money printing. Okay yeah get that. But at some point this has to stop anyways..

And maby a high inflation might make it more difficult for companies to make profits but that's all I can think of. 

So, why be scared? The real scary part of inflation should drive you into stocks not out of it.

nbcn9g,gxyp62m,investing,comment,1620903052,"I start a company selling lemonade,  I outright own a juicer and an ice machine,  I buy lemons and sugar that cost me 80 cents per cup and sell a cup for one dollar making 20 cents per cup.   

I could save my money and buy a second juicer and ice machine and open a second stand in a different neighborhood,  but intrest rates are near zero so I borrowed money from the bank and open a second stand and I've doubled my sales and profits minus a little bit to make the loan payments. My investors are happy. 

I've got my eye on another two locations,  but I get hit by a double whammy, the bank is going to charge me a higher interest rate for a new loan and the price of lemons and sugar have gone up so I'm only making 10 cents per cup.   The people in the neighborhood haven't gotten a raise so it's hard for me to raise prices so I don't open up any new neighborhoods.   My growth rate is flat,  or maybe even down if people are paying more at the grocery store and have less money to spend on lemonade.  If my sales drop far enough I may not even be able to pay my loan payments and I'll go bankrupt.

nbcn9g,gxze1du,investing,comment,1620916850,"Lots of comments here explaining that inflation drives stock prices down because it increases cost of new borrowing.  This might be true of some subset of the market (companies that need to borrow lots of cash all the time), but why would it impact companies with lots of cash on their balance sheets (the major tech companies) or companies that have large existing debt (which gets cheaper with inflation)?

I think what's being missed here is that we've *already had massive inflation* \-- in the prices of stocks in the market.  Why is core inflation bad for stocks in this environment? It's not just the interest rate risk of future debt for them (which can break either way and affects different stocks differently), *it's the risk of a change in the risk-free rate*.  Basically, asset inflation has been driven by the TINA crowd saying that, with a risk-free rate near zero, 2%-4% discount rates on stocks are ok.  If interest rates rise to fight core inflation, then 1%-3% returns might be available risk-free, meaning now the discount rate for equities rises to 4%-6%, driving down the value of future cash flows and the value of these stocks.  DCF is *highly non-linear* in the discount rate, meaning a couple of percentage point rise makes a huge difference in the net present value of the asset.

Prices in this market aren't just assuming gangbuster cash flow growth out many, many years, they are also assuming very, very low interest rates out many years.  This could be true -- 2%-4% could be the best anybody could hope for for a long time.  But these put the market in a precariously unstable point...because the discount rate really can't get lower, and profit assumptions are crazy high.  So it might work out that the prices are right, but really any change in the fundamentals is highly likely to be in the opposite direction.  Asset deflation will follow (sometimes rapidly, sometimes just a long horizontal period).  Personally, I've still been using a 10% discount rate in my screens.  Lots fewer opportunities, but those I do find are much safer long-term.

So should you sell? Well, I don't know -- that's up to you.  But if you've been invested for 5-15-25 years, and all the sudden you had a 40%-100% increase in the last year, was that really reasonable? I'd just stay invested and chalk up any reduction in prices to mean reversion and stay invested, because it wasn't ""real"" anyway and the long-term curve would still look good.  But I'd be selective about investing new money into this market at these prices.",

nbhwdk,,investing,post,1620916062,"Criteo Earnings Update - Progressing in the right directionI wrote about Criteo’s DD in February, pointed out why the company is a hidden gem among adtech companies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Though to be completely honest, the stock performance in the past 3 months hasn’t been as what I expected - mostly due to overall small cap tech getting crushed from asset rotation to reopening plays - but the company has been holding up pretty well against it’s peers. Criteo is more or less up around 5% in the past 3 months (15% off from recent intraday peak), while most of other small caps adtech players are down 40-60% from 3 months ago (even TTD is down almost 40%). 

I continue to feel Criteo is undervalued as a stock compared to its competitors and remain confident with the way the company executes their turnaround plan. For those of you who are not familiar with Criteo, they are making most of their revenue from Retargeting (80% of revenue) with the rest of 20% comes from higher growth areas. Here are the latest facts:

- Criteo is trading at around 2.5x ex-TAC revenue, while many of its competitors are trading at 10-30x (even after they came down by -40/-60%). 

- Retargeting which had been declared by most investment community actually expanded in Q1’21 (+4% for Criteo), even though travel industry hasn’t picked up and faces significant headwind from privacy regulations. 

- Criteo’s New Solutions (20% revenue) is growing at 60% per year with no signs of slowing down, helped by a shift to ecommerce by major offline retailers (Criteo is working with Target, Home Depot, Carrefour and many others) in which Criteo helped them to monetize their website. 

- Criteo has thousands of repeat brands clients (P&G, Adidas, etc), which could use Criteo’s New Solutions hence expanding its Target Addressable Market (TAM) exponentially to more than $70B. 

- Google/Apple privacy updates will benefit those adtech companies that already owns 1st Party data, in this case Criteo is very well positioned. Criteo’s ecommerce reach is around $2B/day and enjoys exclusive access to major retailers/publishers. 

- Criteo is financially sound - it has $600m cash, generating more than $120m free cash flow per year (which is going to increase if New Solutions continue to grow, cost cutting work is also on the way) and with minimal debt. The company is having a buyback program of up to $100m this year, which has been used by $5m in Q1. 

Because of the above reasons, I believe Criteo provides good risk/reward as an investment.","['HD', 'AAPL']"

nbme1l,,investing,post,1620927478,"The 5-2-3 Strategy: My favorite and most profitable way to investFor the last 6-8 months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

If you're at all familiar with the Elliot Wave Principle this is a somewhat altered version of it.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by “hugging” the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Crypto is also susceptible to the 5-2-3 strategy.

&nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could’ve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

nawyv7,,investing,post,1620847246,"The Latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor shortageA lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Things haven't significantly changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.",

nabnrv,,investing,post,1620778132,"Cathie Wood: Deep Dive Into Her 20+ Year Performance HistoryHow could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

All further sources will be at the bottom.

ABSRP beats it's category as the 2001 recession unfolds, but loses to PRNHX. Note that Cathie joined some time in 2001, so it's uknown how much of a contributing factor she was during this period.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

-   IWF: 5.50%

-   PRNHX: 4.50%

&nbsp;

**2016: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

-   **ARKK**: 87.38%

-   VGT: 37.07%

-   IWF: 29.96%

-   PRNHX: 31.49%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

**87.4% return with BTC included.**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

&nbsp;

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

nb3f9x,,investing,post,1620864506,"Holding USD vs. EUR right now.I'm a US citizen living in the Eurozone. I hold both currencies for obvious reasons.

Right now I'm overweight in USD as that's where I have most of my non-short-term savings. I'm wondering, however, if it wouldn't make sense to exchange some of these dollars for euros and hold those instead.

Why?  Inflation is eating at USD right now, and I think the ECB (plus EU fiscal policy) will be less aggressive than the Fed and the US government, thus keeping EUR inflation comparatively low.  Thus, inflation will eat at USD but not at EUR.  Any thoughts on my analysis here?

The next question is if it would make sense, as I've said, to hold more euros instead of dollars.

Obviously there's a lot of factors to consider besides inflation, especially the forex relationship that I don't quite understand.  Would inflation cause the US dollar to appreciate or depreciate with respect to the euro?

There's also other risks like the US dollar potentially being more reliable, etc.

Any thoughts or insight is appreciated.  This sort of micromanagement may be more trouble than it's worth since I'm not sitting on millions (lol), but I figured I'd ask and see what sort of knowledge I can glean.  Thanks!",

It would cause the US dollar to depreciate with respect to the euro (assuming there is higher inflation in the US as you suggested). Currency depreciation and inflation are two sides of the same (increasingly worthless) coin.",
nb3f9x,gxxjwmx,investing,comment,1620871848,"It's really hard to predict currency moves. 

Inflation in the US can also mean that the Fed is more likely to raise rates sooner, which will make the dollar a lot stronger, quickly.

I have a similar issue, having to hedge a couple of currencies (including EUR), and I do it by buying a bit more stocks from companies based in the respective countries/regions which presumably offsets some of the currency risk, while keeping me invested.

They really haven't been from the start, it's mostly just some of the more retail oriented news outlets and a bunch of people on reddit that push that idea.  I consume a lot of professional commentary and I have yet to see anyone in the industry discuss actual concerns over inflation.  

This, among other things, is just illustrative of the strong disconnect between media/social media and market participants.",
nash4a,,investing,post,1620835947,"I was bored and thinking about Ark funds. So I decided to do a breakdown to see how much of each fund is represented within ARKK. Figured I'd share if anyone else was interested.Hi all, 

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one. 

Anyway thought this was a fun exercise and figured I'd share if anyone else were interested. 

Long story short is ARKK is actually a pretty good sum of all of the other funds. If you want to keep it simple, just go with ARKK.",['ARKK']

narqy0,,investing,post,1620834150,"How bubble like is todays real-estate market?Just looking for some perspective from this /r.  I think I may have run across a possible bubble in real estate:  Seniors.  There are a lot of seniors who are staying in their homes longer, and along with the many other forces at work, that is having a tightening effect on the supply, driving up prices.  When (if) we get this pandemic under control there will be a lot of older folks moving out of their homes and moving into senior living communities.  

I had been calling around looking for a place for my folks, and I have been getting bombarded with sales people looking to fill vacancies at the senior living facilities.  In talking with them a bit they were saying that they have quite a lot of available capacity.

So if a lot of seniors put their houses on the market, will it just be some price relief, or will it be a bubble bursting?",

n9zazb,,investing,post,1620746022,"Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

QE on it's own is probably long-term disinflationary since it enables lower cost of capital which generally pushes more commodity supply into the market relative to unchanging demand.

Fiscal stimulus on the other hand is very inflationary. And even more inflationary than fiscal stimulus are supply shocks and constraints. Supply side inflation is more pernicious than demand-based inflation, although it usually tends to be more self-correcting.",

najjey,gxtxl4s,investing,comment,1620807474,"I tend to agree. The inflation I'm seeing has more to do with supply-side factors like production limitations and demand artificially spiking.  It is kind of obvious when it is only certain commodities or products that have high inflation while for broad baskets of commodities, the inflation is minimal.

nawmze,,investing,post,1620846400,"Inverse ETF’s / 6 months savingsI often hear that before investing, it’s important to have 3-6 months of savings put away in case of emergencies. I’ve been wondering what the drawbacks are to being fully invested with no savings whatsoever if you have most of your money an index fund and your “savings” in an inverse ETF.

Say I have $100,000 in the bank and I’m ready to go all in in the stock market. If I put $80,000 in SPY and $20,000 in SH (SPY inverse ETF), aren’t I virtually guaranteed to have those 6 months worth of living expenses available to me at any time?

If there’s an emergency during a bull run, I can pull the necessary funds from SPY at a profit. If I invest $20,000 in SH at $16/share, and there’s an unexpected crash/bear market three months from now, and I’ll be able to pull that out at a profit.

This seems way too simplistic so I’m thinking it must be. Why have savings at all? Why isn’t everyone 100% in the stock market with their “savings” in something like SH or anything else (I wouldn’t know) that goes up when stocks go down?",

nawmze,gxw3em3,investing,comment,1620847901,You’re complicating things with the inverse. You’re really just adding unnecessary fees because your net exposure to the S&P is 60% if you’re long 80k and short 20k. There’s no convexity to owning the inverse so you’ll perform the same way you would if you just put 60k in SPY and held 40k in cash since your net exposure is still 60% SPY.,['SPGI']

nadzhy,,investing,post,1620785496,"Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/sam-zell-buys-gold-with-inflation-reminiscent-of-the-1970s

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",

I'm not a fan of the PLTR meme train or whatever, and after following some investor day bananas and their demo days and whatnot, I still don't understand whatever the hell they really do, but I can see it's state-of-the-art stuff that will continue to ""lock-in"" contracts for the future

Literally the only problem with this stock, at least in my eyes, is their overwhelming float of shares - but I'm not sure if this or the market cap really matters, it's an extremely high-volume and liquid stock that will probably have ~40-50% solid gains annually (so long as we don't tank by mid-2022, which of course remains a possibility on the table at current valuations anyway).

I have 0 shares, considered buying in at ~16 pre-market today, but missed the boat. Will probably consolidate at around 18-19 for the remainder of the month unless we get a bull charge in the coming weeks (doubtful).",

I suspect that the rising tensions in the middle east can ‘fuel’ (gas joke sorry) bad relationships and cutoff ties with the United States. By doing so, we will become increasingly reliant on Exxon Mobil. Not sure how high this can push the stock price, but it is for sure a catalyst.

narr02,,investing,post,1620834154,"Western Digital - The Next NvidiaAs the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.","['AMD', 'FB', 'NVDA', 'WDC', 'AMZN']"

I'm not looking at a short-term 5 to 10 year trends such as, for example, weed stocks which I expect to reach market saturation relatively soon (but what do I know), or real estate bubbles, although perhaps it makes sense looking at the long-term trend of urbanization.

n9snsw,gxpqg7e,investing,comment,1620730170,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are dropping this morning, with tech and small caps leading the way lower. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 already down 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. S&P 500 futures down 0.8%. Dow Industrials 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0635.

This follows another day of selling in tech. The Nasdaq was down 2.5% yesterday, its worst day since March. The index is now down 4% this month. Sell in May? Well, Dow Industrials are up 2.5% and the S&P is green as well (barely).

This begs two questions: 1. What’s causing the tech sell-off? 2. Is it a buying opportunity?

The former appears to be this ‘rotation trade’ into cyclicals (and staples). I suspect interest rate hikes are starting to be priced in as well. The latter I discuss on the audio.

na82fc,,investing,post,1620768033,"How will the business around selfdriving trucks may look?Everyone talks about electrification of cars, and that cool self driving feature, where you can sit back and watch a movie with your family. And yes, that's pretty neat. The car manufacturer have to change a big chunk of their product (but not all), batteries will take a big part and all around the world, the whole industry will shift. Some new players appear, some will grow and some will die. But I think this won't be a big market interruption (like the smartphone industry with apps and internet to-go), but more of a slower change.

But something I think might highly interrupt the market in a very short time, will be self driving trucks. And that's what I'd like to hear your opinion about.

The first thing that comes to mind is *yea cool, you don't need to pay a driver and spare $40,000 a year*. But that's too short sighted. You think a company who owns 10 trucks and 10 drivers now, suddenly will own 10 trucks and 0 drivers? I don't think so.

From my personal experience with trucking: The company I work for builds specialized machinery for our customers. When it's time for delivery, we have scheduled the amount of trucks we need (1-5), the time for pick up, delivery and location anywhere in europe (I'm from germany btw). We usually use the same trucking company, because they're close by and we've already established a business relationship with them. 

But this needs a lot of pre planing. If manufacturing is delayed, the delivery will be delayed, the trucking company needs to hold back truck & driver and so on.

With self driving trucks it doesn't matter. No driver to keep on hold. You don't need a trucking company 'close by', because there is no homebase for a self driving truck every few days. This might doesn't sound big, but it basically opens up the door for an Uber-like trucking company, availability like a taxi. You call and they come an hour later. This is convenience at it's best. It's something the bigger companys try to offer already, but its fucking expensive at the moment. You have to have free trucks and divers somewhere near at all times, to offer a service like that.

And yes, there are many companys that have their own trucks. Especially for shorter distances like between distribution centers and retailers. But for any other form of shipping, outsourcing trucking is already prevalent.

Long story short: my question here is, what are your thoughts about this and who might be a the winner? Is it companys like FedEx and Amazon, who have a huge fleet of trucks and can suddenly offer different kinds of deliverys, like freight forwarding ^is ^that ^a ^word^? ? Is it the company that builds trucks? The software? The tire manufacturer because trucking will grow exponentially? The satelite operator? Anyone else?","['AMZN', 'FDX']"

The first autonomous trucks drive from rally points between cities. Highway driving is the easiest for autonomous vehicles since there is very simple traffic rules and few unexpected obstacles. Once at the check point they will switch off to a manual driver if needing to drive in more complex environments. 

several trucks will have a single remote operater. If a truck is having a problem it will alert the remote operator to take control until the truck can resume driving again. 

Andrew Yang is one of the few politicians who is recognizing this and trying to help out before all the truck drivers are laid off.

n93uwi,,investing,post,1620651600,"CNBC: A psychedelic drug boom in mental health treatment comes closer to reality CMPS MNMD CLXPF ATAI by Eric RosenbaumMental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

&#x200B;

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

So I'm fairly new in this topic. I did some reading in the threads provided here but it didn't quite provide the answers I was looking for.

Currently I (27M) am working in a company that provides a ESPP, up to 15% of my salary monthly, purchased in 6 month installments (at a 15% discount). I can change my contribution once per year (every May) and cash out every 6 months (after the purchase has been completed). Currently I contribute 3% of my salary only, but want to bump it up to 10%. The ESPP is done via eTrade. This is where my questions begin: I would like to sell my stocks (as I don't want to be holding single stock) and invest in some ETFs or something more secure. I see Vanguard recommended a lot on here but since my plan is through eTrade I would prefer keeping it simple and using them- but how do I begin?

Any good resources to read up on this, to properly set up my account for this and any other tips to a beginner?

One additional note I would make is that I am a dual citizen (US/German) and live and pay taxes in Germany. However the Etrade account is US based, and in USD. What sort of tax implications do I face and how do I deal with them?

There’s been no shortage of posts regarding high valuations / the potential bubble / the supposedly inevitable correction/crash/bear market. Whenever there is a post asking how to best prepare/protect against this potential correction, the general response is “lump sum always beats DCA / don’t try to time the market.”

If I first began investing in a basic s&p 500 index just before the dot com bubble crashed, and lump summed all of my cash, it would have taken me nearly two decades to get out of the red, that is, if I was able to hold all that time without selling at a loss. As a new investor, I’m afraid of this happening again. I’m debating whether or not it’s even worth investing right now, but the general sentiment seems to be to never hold cash trying to time the market.

I’m not investing for retirement, as I have a pretty good pension plan and I’m still relatively young (25). For someone with no money currently in the market who is looking to invest  with more short term goals (say 5-10 years), what is the best option given current valuations? With the knowledge you have now after years of investing, what would your strategy be?

n94bfc,,investing,post,1620652939,"Some long-term strategies worth remembering in today's speculative and volatile marketsBefore we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

(collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

The inverse also tends to be true on what to sell. Sell off low growth yield, sell off companies that are going to be adversely affected by rising wage input prices or rising input prices for the base commodities. 

**So in other words, go long on:** Oil, metals miners, agricultural inputs, banks, insurance companies, companies with pricing power. Industrials (XLI) tend to be good at the start of reflation, but as inflation starts to bite into the economy, a lot of the industrials end up getting hit hard from high producer price inputs. Industrials tend to be sensitive to demand from emerging markets, so a lot depends on what is going on there.

n90hkk,,investing,post,1620639488,"Market valuations and investing allocations - indexes vs stock pickingHi.

I want some input here, cause I simply can't make my mind up.

I'm currently holding my PF, while adding a small amount of money in 5 different index funds monthly.

In terms of money I'm saving about $ 700 in an world index fund every month as locked in pension savings, and another $ 700 in 5 different index funds for personal savings (E.M., Scandinavia, Europe, World and small cap - I'm considering wiping the Europe fund here, but I digress). So that's $ 1400 montly in indexes.

I'm also stacking about $ 2000 in cash every month. This goes hopefully into the market in the future or as downpayment on my mortgage (depending on inflation and change in interest).

Other than that I have a stock picking PF with a handful of companies. 

Now here's the kicker. I'm aware I can't time the market. I don't believe I can, but the question is whether I see a big upside in indexes from here on. And I'm not sure I do. The markets might keep growing a bit more, but I feel the risk reward is unfavourable atm, and I wonder if indexes isn't the right thing now. I honestly feel far more comfortable with doing value buys, and there's less risk of buying dividend blue chips who aren't in favour.

A few months ago my last big buy happened and that was Bayer AG. After that I've kind of been on the sidelines as I haven't seen anything interesting.

What's your opinion on investing right now? Would you stick to investing heavily in indexes or rotate into stock picking?  If so, would you sell off index funds? Or ride it out?",

n90hkk,gxlezp8,investing,comment,1620644410,"If you suffer from FOMO by only buying ETFs rather than picking stocks, why not go for a hybrid strategy. If you have identified an undervalued stock in a given month, invest your $2,000 in it. If you don't have one, buy an ETF instead. Or switch between ETF and stock each month.

You should probably also stick to some other rules you set yourself ahead of time to help you follow a strategy rather than giving in to well-known pitfalls. For example, maybe don't allow yourself to buy stock you already have a position in (so eg. you don't convince yourself it sure will go up now, after all it's fallen 25% since you bought it).

This is my thoughts, not advice as such. That would be ""choose an ETF and buy it every month"".",

Will the market eventually crash and hard, maybe, but why do I honestly care when the alternative is holding cash with an actually worthless ROI and at the end of the day if the S&P 500 goes to zero you'll have bigger problems to worry about than what is going on in your portfolio.

When there's record inflows and there's money pouring into stocks and people are getting complacent, that doesn't mean ""imminent top"" necessarily, but it's not as good of a time and if it continues, eventually might be record inflows into funds but record low money on the sideline.",
n8zfda,gxm8t3a,investing,comment,1620660467,"FWIW this has very little to do with ETFs structurally.  In fact there's a pretty good argument to be made that money flowing into market weighted ETFs is better than money flowing into stock picking (from the retail perspective... opposite from the institutional investor).  The argument being that since ETFs are market weighted, to they extent that they exert pressure on the overall market (and it's arguable how much they do), that pressure is felt evenly rather than in specific stocks reducing price distortion (or distributing it more evenly).  Ironically institutional investors would likely prefer the distortion (hence lots of ETF bad articles) as price distortions are potentially profitable trading events (this is how pump and dumps work).                       

Anyways this article is not great.  The author fails to distinguish risk differences between leveraged ETFs and broad market ETFs.  Pointing out that a leveraged ETF outperformed a broad market ETF in a bull run is garbage tier analysis.          

As others have pointed out, historically retail investors chase performance.  Performance chasing is typically a bad strategy.  When the retail investors show up to the party, that party is typically over.  They buy out the institutional positions and the market runs out of momentum because future growth is being baked into the stock prices.",
n8nkcd,,investing,post,1620594296,"Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?",
n8nkcd,gxlzv3o,investing,comment,1620656523,"Approving this thread, but ordinarily this is an advice topic and belongs in the daily advice thread.  However, it has generated some conversation, and controversy, where none really exists.

Leveraged real estate does not outperform unleveraged investment in the S&P.  It doesn't outperform it historically, and we would expect the gap to widen as real estate prices continue to rise.

Here is a [real world comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SS7BdVDymVerxNf2j6hQ4cPgswfYVDHBzDA7ll6Jav4/edit?usp=sharing) based on a real example^(1) provided by one of our real estate enthusiast Redditors.

i dont think getting lucky picking tech is the same as low risk. if your comparison relies on hindsight analysis its probably pretty ineffective

real estate allows for pretty significant growth. keep in mind that you use a significant amount of leverage when buying real estate, if you put down 20% on a 1m property and it grows 10% in a year youve gained a lot more than 10% relative to your actual investment",

Buyers always want to buy at a better price than sellers want to sell.  This is true even when you aren’t looking at stocks or bonds or currencies.  

Things don’t have a true price.  They have a price that is somewhere the good will get exchanged.  The bid ask spread reflects that range.  

When there is an underlying, its not necessarily a simple math problem to calculate what that is.  An ETF of a crypto is not the actual crypto.  You can’t pull your ETF into an offline wallet for example.  Its also easier to move in and out of an ETF since its traded on a stock exchange instead of a currency exchange.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

n8udjg,,investing,post,1620615985,"Seeking Long Horizon Investment AdviceI'm contemplating making some investment changes, but am concerned about a possible double dip correction in the near/semi-near future. I realize that this thinking flies in the face of the ""time in the market, as opposed to timing the market"" strategy. 

So, the bulk of my retirement is in a Vanguard Target Date Fund, which I contribute to monthly. I also have a legacy retirement account from a former employer, which earns 4 percent annually. I am considering rolling over those funds to my Target Date IRA though. Thoughts?

I also have 6 figures sitting in a cash reserve account earning a paltry 45 basis points; wish I had been more aggressive in March 2020. Anyhow, my thinking is to invest a portion of those funds in the vehicles below now - taxable account - and leave some dry powder for potential corrections:

- Emerging Markets (FEMKX): I have roughly 5% exposure in my Target Date Fund, but am looking to possibly increase based on future market forecasts. Thoughts?

- REIT's (VGSLX/VNQ): I don't have any exposure here and like the potential, as well as the dividend yield. Thoughts? 

- Disruptor Fund (FGDFX): A Fidelity alternative to Cathie Wood's disruptive funds. 

- Other: Alternative / Renewable Energy, Cannabis, and Biotech Funds/ETF's: Thoughts?

Finally, any suggestions on lump sum investments in the above (others) now or dollar cost averaging over time?

n8hkut,,investing,post,1620577266,"Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

A real risk parity portfolio should use futures (as All Weather and AQR do) for the lowest financing rates to efficiently achieve a high enough allocation of low vol assets. Many retail investors do not have a broker that supports futures or enough capital to practically use treasury rate futures, so some use leveraged ETFs or options instead. Many risk-parity-flavored model portfolios like All Seasons and Hedgefundie's do not bother to actually calculate a risk parity allocation, or update it over time, and instead use a simple static allocation that is close enough. There's nothing magical about doing an exact rp allocation though. It's just another method of generating diversified portfolios without full knowledge of future asset performance.",

n8j1vj,gxitca8,investing,comment,1620584772,"They'll sell it.

For particulars you need to the read the prospectus of the Index. The prospectus will explain things like how closely they will mirror what they are indexing. There is usually an allowance for minor mis-weighting of stocks. There is also an allowance for how much time they have to make changes.

SPY is suppose to make changes, as needed, at least once a month and they allow the fund to make changes more often during periods of significant change.

But this can get complicated quickly too....ETFs are designed to be sold and traded between investors, but new shares  of the ETF can also be created or redeemed each business day... The holder often will redeem shares if the holdings in the ETF are undervalued by the ETF price. This is the mechanism that keeps the ETF consistently values with what is in the fund.  This means the index has to buy or remove stocks for the fund on a daily basis in very small amounts. (redeeming typically only happens on a large institutional level)

Typically this buying, in particular, starts adjusting to the new weighting of the S&P 500 index, so companies that were removed or lost value are more likely to be sold and companies that gained value or were added are more likely to be bought.

This means each day the fund starts changing towards the more updated index they are trying to mirror through the natural change.

&#x200B;

Lastly, it is important to remember if an ETF index fund is weighted by market capitalization, the companies that enter of leave the index are usually a tiny fraction of the index's total capitalization.

Just as some examples, #450 is only 0.032% of the index, #500 is only 0.016% of the index, #400 is 0.043% of the index.

The top of the index #1 is 5.76%, #50 is 0.43%, #100 0.23%... and so on.

The reason I mention this part is most companies being removed from the index usually fall in market capitalization over a period of time before they are dropped from the index. They become a smaller portion of the index as it drops in market capitalization, so the index has likely been slowly selling off the asset over time.

By the time it becomes #480 before not being in the index at all, it is very small. There isn't that much to sell, so there is somewhat of a gradual change built in to the fund in most cases... Of course, any large abrupt changes in the market, means larger changes are needed at one time in the index portfolio.",['SPGI']

n8fpef,,investing,post,1620571698,"Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",['GOOGL']

Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

So the whole idea of CET1 is that it's capital the bank's investors stand to lose.  That's usually equity, but also any earnings they're entitled to which is why retained earnings and AOCI get lumped in there.  In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize.

Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.",['CB']
n8pzgh,,investing,post,1620601476,"The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow RapidlyI may do a much longer and well-sourced post on this when I have more time, but here's a rundown of why the small arms industry, in my opinion, is an excellent long term investment, not even looking at how the Biden administration will play into the cyclical nature of gun stocks.



**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",['AAPL']

Not to mention the constant deadlock on gun control, I assume as a US person, all other countries are becoming more and more strict on gun control, making guns harder to obtain and more socially unacceptable.

War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growth, not the civilian market.

Just because the pandemic and political situation helped the gun industry (jury's still out on that) doesn't mean it's a safe long term investment.

Guns are on a long-term growth trend, but to a large degree, guns sales the past several months have been driven by a) yearly seasonal effects (hunting season + people blowing their tax returns), b) a Presidential election year, which always sees higher gun sales and c) the pandemic and ensuing recession caused a buying spree.

Right now all three of those effects are going away, so I expect gun sales to decelerate rapidly over the next few months.   I've finally found some guns I've been looking for in stock again after months of them being sold out, which suggests my thesis is correct.

For those Tesla investors who don't subscribe to Barrons, they ran a story today:

>*Tesla Stock Is Dead Money—for Now. Sell in May and go away usually refers to the entire stock market. Right now it also applies to Tesla’s stock.*[https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-needs-a-catalyst-here-are-some-contenders-51620434748?mod=hp\_DAY\_2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-needs-a-catalyst-here-are-some-contenders-51620434748?mod=hp_DAY_2)

The author's argument is that Tesla lacks a big catalyst to drive shares higher. He doesn't mention new factories under construction, or the push into cryptocurrencies, or changing opinions toward electric vehicles. The bottom line, he argues, is that TSLA isn't going straight up.

>*After an epic rise, the stock has stalled. That is just what Tesla stock tends to do—rocket higher after major milestones, then do nothing for a while.*

The author's point is valid, but also irrelevant. Unless your investment horizon is right now, this isn't a problem.

The same point could have been made about Amazon 10 years ago. Or Netflix. Or Apple. Or Shopify. Or Bitcoin. No investment goes straight up forever. That's ok. If you're in a hurry to make money fast, then maybe Tesla isn't the right investment. Most of the people who made serious money investing in MSFT, AAPL, or GOOG, or AMZN, or NFLX, or FB, or SHOP, held on for a longer time horizon. If you bail because there are no short term catalysts (that you know of), or because the stock goes down short term, you may kick yourself later. Even Bitcoin dropped 80% 2 years ago (from its then all time high of $20k). People who bailed then missed a great opportunity.

n7cmlw,,investing,post,1620431992,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returnsRecent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?",['ARKK']

n7cmlw,gxdgsdy,investing,comment,1620469016,"""now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.""

I think it's questionable that fund managers should be out there predicting their returns for the next 5 years. I can't recall another retail fund manager that has ever been in the press predicting literal % returns for the next 5 years (or 1 year for that matter.) A manager might say ""I expect a good year for tech"" if they're a tech fund or that sort of thing but I can't recall another mutual fund or ETF manager saying ""I predict X% annualized for my fund for the next 5 years."" I thought it was iffy when she did it earlier this year and now she's doing it again. So to me it's not even the math of the projections but the fact that she continues to do it in the first place.

She's really ""hyper growth all the time"" - the issue becomes it's not going always be in favor (and I think people took last year's unbelievable/once in a great while performance as confirmation/validation of hyper growth rather than possibly a ""grand finale"" - at least for a while - to cap off a decade where growth was largely the ""only game in town""), but she invests as if that's the case. Look at recently with her selling large liquid names into declines so she can buy even more of smaller, less liquid things a lot of which she already owns 10% or more of. What if she sells all the large liquid names and the decline keeps going? I wish Ark could be more dynamic in its approach - it feels like everything has to be hyper growth all the time or it's not ""on brand.""

""But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist)

She's said that there will be declines/corrections, but she doesn't invest as if that's the case and those statements are offset by her very bullish long-term predictions. ""There might be some big declines, but listen to how well this is going to do!"" I said early this year on here that the performance was not sustainable as the discussion became more and more Ark-y on here.

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly (""What to Expect From Funds After They Gain 100% or More in a Year? Trouble, Mostly"")

 Additionally, how much of the money that has poured into Ark came late? The inflows really didn't start en masse last year until in the second half of the year when the funds were already up 100% YTD. Tons of new investors started earlier this year and I'm sure a lot of them went right to Ark, chasing last year's performance. 

""Money Tree"" seemed to be the peak in Feb. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree.

Employed $3500 USD p/m

Objectives: Long term growth and investment / retirement

Time horizon 10-15 yrs

Risk tolerance: moderate

Holdings $6000 USD, no debt, $3000 USD liquidity

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.",['SPGI']

Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

2020 LIST OF STOCKS:

* ABMD
* ADBE
* ANET
* BWXT
* CRL
* DG
* ENR
* ETSY
* EXEL
* ISRG
* KLAC
* LKQ
* LRCX
* MNST
* MPWR
* MTCH
* OLED
* PAYC
* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

\*I    am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to   ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results   and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t    understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and    henceforth. You are welcome to do whatever you like with the    information, though if you’re going to sell it that’s some pretty messed    up \*\*\*\*. Past results are no guarantee of future returns.","['LRCX', 'DG', 'SPGI', 'TYL', 'AMAT', 'APH', 'GRMN', 'FB', 'MSFT', 'CDNS', 'ADBE', 'ETSY', 'INTU', 'ISRG', 'LKQ', 'FTNT', 'VRTX', 'TER', 'ANET', 'MNST', 'PHM', 'MKTX', 'INTC', 'TROW', 'MPWR', 'IBM', 'ABMD', 'REGN', 'EW', 'TSLA', 'ATVI', 'ALGN', 'AAPL', 'ACN', 'CHD', 'IP', 'NVDA', 'ODFL', 'PAYC', 'CPRT', 'EXPD', 'KLAC', 'TDY', 'PAYX']"

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['WMT', 'AMZN', 'NFLX']"

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",

n6dh3d,,investing,post,1620324294,"I sold every share I own today.I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

n75u6r,,investing,post,1620413353,"Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls ShockGold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.","['PM', 'ED']"

First off, what is your percentage gain per year and what is your strategy to beat the market?  Also, if you have access to this data, what is your risk metrics such as Standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, Alpha, Beta, R squared.

My idea is that in order to beat the market, most people have to take outsize risks.  Me for example.  Here is my stats...

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210507005048/en/NuScale-Engages-Guggenheim-Securities-to-Explore-Financing-Options

I’m personally optimistic about the future of nuclear companies due to their potential contributions to any goals towards reducing carbon emissions. There’s no way we’re going to meet these targets without a large push to nuclear, and it seems like NuScale is the furthest ahead out of the new technologies. For example, they are the only SMR to have an approved design by the NRC, and I think it’s only a matter of time before they get more customers signing up to get plants in the US and around the world. 

Looking at Guggenheim’s history, it seems like they have steered similar companies towards a SPAC offering. How can I try and get in on any public offering if they are looking to go this route?",

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Conclusion. Get in losers, were doing the roaring 2020s. And they are mad that the poors have a better chance of capturing income in this decade.",

I've noticed that a good number of serious, professional and semi-professional intraday and swing traders focus on a couple of dozen stocks. My question is, do stocks have their own unique personalities, and if they do, what are the best ways to learn what they are?

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

n6fysa,,investing,post,1620330775,"In just 3 months, Tesla has issued 80% of the shares ARK's valuation model projected they would issue through 2025.Their model is beyond amateurish.  Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

n6klu0,,investing,post,1620343064,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

Happy investing!","['SIVB', 'SPGI', 'AMZN', 'YUM']"

> … **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn’t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> …even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It’s just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

n6klu0,gxaqfnb,investing,comment,1620409257,"I'm a little conflicted by this line of argument. I recommend low-cost indexing to anyone who asks in my personal life, so I definitely support the broader argument here. Further, there are entire subreddits dedicated to [obvious scams](https://old.reddit.com/r/NKLA/) and other pump-and-dumps so there's clearly a need for this type of analysis.

On the other hand, it's so alien to my experience that it comes off to me as unpersuasive. I've probably held 50+ individual stocks in my life and none of them went defunct. Even broadening it to every company I've put on a watchlist, that number is still zero out of 200+ companies. The few delisted were products of M&A, and generally profitable for shareholders.

This article itself shows the numbers are vastly different for large companies, where 77% of the top 1000 companies by market cap made positive returns and just 7% are gone.  Further there's the minefield of Biotech stocks which decay steadily to zero unless they develop a profitable drug. [18 of the 32](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_stocksonly,ta_perf_52w75u&ft=3&o=industry) stocks down 75% over the last year come from this one industry - two more are generic drug developers.

Finally, even if stocks were exactly the unavoidable minefield described in this article, it's not a mathematically persuasive argument against active investing. After all, an active strategy could also include direct indexing where an investor owns merely *most* of an index. If owning just a few stocks is bad, then owning all but a few has to be the mirror image, right? You're effectively indexing + shorting a bad active strategy.",

The two types of people I guess. I, too, have fun working my way through the numbers, but I respect everyone who has enough self-control to just invest and turn their back for a few years.

n6rgw5,,investing,post,1620366351,"Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500Hi,

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","['NFLX', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'ADBE', 'SPGI', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']"

It's 150%, actually.

>Through which business segment?

Ads. Their ad revenue growth was 77% YoY for the last quarter and it doesn't really have costs.

>Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.

I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.

* Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously [cash-heavy](https://merchantmachine.co.uk/most-reliant-on-cash/) countries.
* After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.

> AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.

* There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.
* Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.
* The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend)).

Taking the points above into account, we probably won't see a massive decline in AWS growth for a while.","['GOOGL', 'AMZN']"

I need to look into the growth further.  However, it's concerning to me because they just reached profitability in 2020.  A quick look shows revenue growth could decline from 14% to 10% in the next 2 years.  That's down from 40% just a few years ago.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

nbhdvw,,StockMarket,post,1620914645,"Elon is not wrong about $BTC.He really isn’t. Objectively speaking.

$BTC is incredibly flawed, no matter how influential and defining it’s been for the entire crypto-revolution.

$BTC maxis are claiming the false statistic of ”75% $BTC miners use renewable energy”. While the correct statement is ”75% of $BTC miners use SOME renewable energy”. In reality, most of the energy is from non-renewables and by far the most used and relied upon form of energy is coal (the most harmful one).

Claiming that $BTC incentivizes the use of green energy is equally as good of an argument as saying ”Poverty is great because it incentivizes humanitarian aid”.

Also, bringing into the argument how much the traditional banking system spends energy is irrelevant. They process billions of transactions daily/weekly, and constantly move trillions of $ in value. The offered services and utilities are also uncomparable.
If $BTC had the same volume and adoption as the traditional banking/financial system, the energy usage would be like the usage of the entirety of Europe x10000. It’s an hilariously utopian dream.

Decentralization, that’s another flaw. $BTC is absolutely not decentralized. Because of China. China essentially has complete control over half of the network, if they want to. This is because of most of the mining facilities are in China and if they wanted to, they could disrupt the most of the network by cutting power from the facilities. Now I don’t know about you, but this does not sound very ”decentralized” nor ”out of governmental control and intrusion” to me.

There’s no reason for $BTC to exist when there are almost infinitely better options available, like $NANO for example. The only people still shilling for $BTC are the ones who are financially tied to the project and are unable to objectivelly assess and evaluate crypto projects.

$BTC is like the Wright brothers’ plane, while e.g. $NANO (or any other comparable technologically superior project) is a F-35.",

Anyways, would it be wise to have both free standing stocks and an index fund for an example? And should they be like 50/50 of value in both? 

I read this book that said a good foundation was and index fund, then some stocks and then some short term stock picks. That sounds pretty solid to me. But I’d appreciate any “live advice” from Redditors who also use stocks and stuff.

So far 95% of our savings are in individual stocks and 5% just laying in a 0% interest bank.

nbk9dj,gxztbvr,StockMarket,comment,1620923394,"A broad index fund smooths out both the gains and the losses.

If you invest in individual stocks, some may do incredibly well, handily beating an index, and some may tank completely. So you are missing out on some potential gains, but you are also missing out on some major losses!

If you are diversified in individual stocks with many quality companies, that can also smooth out your portfolio’s performance. But that’s exactly what an index fund attempts to do, only at a much larger scale since they typically hold hundreds or even thousands of companies. It’s not usually practical to attain that level of diversification buying lots of individual stocks yourself.

It’s fine and good practice to do both - index funds and stocks.",

In our last outlook, we were expecting the price to see further losses as it was located in a descending triangle pattern.

The price has broken down from the triangle, reaching low at $4.53, which attracted some buyers and went for a test of 50 EMA at $4.70.

This test was unsuccessful nad the price broke down to our bespoke support at $4.50, where it has find some decent buying interest.

Buying interest has quickly escalated as the price shortly retested the key resistance at $4.80.

Currently the price has found support at previous resistance at $4.70, meaning previous resistance now becomes support at this level. 

This means that the price has found support on EMA levels and is ready for another test of $4.80.

The price has to hold above $4.70 in order to finally change into an uptrend.

nbhvhy,gxzebfq,StockMarket,comment,1620916973,"1. You can calculate a moving average using whatever period you desire.
2. With a shorter period, there are less values to use to calculate the average, so changes to the value have a more pronounced effect on the average.

Consider a 5 period moving average, where the window currently contains `1, 1, 1, 2, 2`. The average here is 1.4. If the next value is 10, the window becomes `1, 1, 2, 2, 10` and the average jumps to 3.2.

Now consider a 10 period moving average, let's say we're using the same stock at the same time, the window contains `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2`, the 10 period moving average is 1.2. Very similar to the 5 period average. But then we add the 10, we calculate a new average with `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 10` and the result is 2.1, much lower, because we had all that extra history dragging it down.

We see that by including more values in the moving average, we reduce the sensitivity of the average to changes as they smooth the average out.",

naz442,,StockMarket,post,1620852785,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 12, 2021PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 12, 2021

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown.

However the other company we've been watching is z1pco with their introduced ability to use a virtual credit card install that's been implemented and some new things upcomming it seems like a solid investment. The share price has had a few swings higher and a few small dips but has been mostly stable around the 6 dollar mark but that's looking to jump from what I can see 

I just dropped $500 into this morning, I was wondering if people had any thoughts on it, on whether they think it's a good investment or not. I expect it to go down the same path as afterpay, it's a better service for customers, the only thing is as a BNPL it makes most of it's money through service fees or the actual credit/loans they issue with their zipmoney side.

These junior gold and silver mining companies are the best bet to protect and grow your assets. Great buy-ins at the ground level and once sound money becomes back in the spotlight, you will be perfectly positioned. With that being said....

**Westhaven Gold Corp.** is pleased to announce drill results from its ongoing drill campaign at its 17,623-hectare Shovelnose gold property. Shovelnose is located within the prospective Spences Bridge Gold Belt, which borders the Coquihalla Highway 30 kilometres south of Merritt, British Columbia.

This news is not shocking for the company and its shareholders, they see high-grade drill results all the time. Although getting results such as:

* 15.97m of 9.15 g/t gold and 27.43 g/t silver, and (SN21-161)

are wonderful to see, the best part here is that these two locations are km's apart from each other!

These results are proving that the property has multiple high grade zones, which make the potential very promising. There may be more elsewhere still undiscovered. Multi-million ounce high-grade deposits are indicative of a long lasting and profitable properties that can easily bump the SP up heavily. The possibility here is very high for that to happen, and future results will solidify that even further.

It is reported that more assay results should released within a few weeks with more great numbers such as these. It's also reported that visible gold is being seen in the drill cores, which is always a good sign!

The market was not very kind to anyone yesterday, pushing the news down and not letting it flourish as it should have. That being said, it is a great buying opportunity to get some shares on great news.

Gareth Thomas, President & CEO of Westhaven Gold, states: “With this significant high-grade gold-silver drill intercept at the FMN Zone, our theory that more high-grade centres occur along this major NW-SE structure has proven correct. Hole SN21-161 (15.97m of 9.15 g/t Au and 27.43 g/t Ag) is approximately 700m away from the Franz Zone discovery drill hole SN20-101 (7.78m of 14.84 g/t Au and 40.68 g/t Ag). Our Exploration Manager, Peter Fischl talked about a “kink” in the structure and its importance for potential mineralization along key structures exhibiting strike-slip movement.

nard6c,,StockMarket,post,1620833176,"Confused about Wash Sale rules I just started investing with Fidelity and I have been pretty active. I also have some minor OCD so I have made some decisions that I have undone relatively quickly.

I bought a number of stocks and ETFs that I regretted a few days later and sold to eventually move into broad market indexes. After a few days, I even sold most of my shares in the broad index to just wait and see what happens with inflation and the rising CPI and to just ease my mind.  I think I jumped in too fast.

I'm concerned that most of my sales have a small percentage that is a 'Wash Sale'. I understand what a Wash Sale is, but I don't see how that applies to all of these stocks that I bought and then resold a few days later. I know it occurs when you sell a holding for a loss and then buy a similar one within 30 days, but I don't think I did any of that. I never rebought any of these stocks.

Would I get a Wash Sale because I sold a stock for a loss then purchased a broad market index?  Or do you get a wash sale every time you sell a stock for a loss that you bought in the past 30 days?

Also - I sold most of my shares in ITOT today for a loss, and I have a few hundred that is listed as a Wash Sale (positive). Is this because I had purchased the initial stock within 30 days prior? If that is the case, how is it possible to day trade if you are penalized for selling a stock for a loss that you bought within the past 30 days? I'm a new investor and confused.",
nard6c,gxv4uc2,StockMarket,comment,1620833883,"Yes: *Or do you get a wash sale every time you sell a stock for a loss that you bought in the past 30 days?*

Remember, a  wash sales is a loss you can't use as a tax deduction against ***ordinary income***.  Selling at a loss was your call, that's not a penalty. 

You can get a wash sale if you add to your position (lowering the average) then selling above that average BUT below the original purchase.  Those original shares would be sold at a loss - hello wash!

&#x200B;

ProTip: Ignore wash sales.  Concentrate on realized gains.  That's what you pay taxes on because that's profit...and that's all that matters.",
nard6c,gxv6jki,StockMarket,comment,1620834578,"> If that is the case, how is it possible to day trade if you are penalized for selling a stock for a loss that you bought within the past 30 days?

You aren't penalized. You just can't deduct that loss against capital gains. I think you're confused about the overall impact of the wash sale rule. Just don't worry about it until it's time to file taxes. There's no point in trying to evade it, it only exists so people can't easily reset their cost basis without paying taxes.",

I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with.

since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains.

na6wzs,,StockMarket,post,1620765112,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to roughly break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve. 

**Highlights**

* [Prices for single-family homes in the U.S. surged by the most on record](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-home-prices-surge-most-141744748.html) in the first three months of the year, with tight inventory levels and a jump in demand generating a rise in prices. Prices rose 16.2% year-over-year to reach a record high of $319,200, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.
* L Brands (LB) said it is spinning off Victoria's Secret. The move will result in the lingerie chain operating as its own publicly traded company
* Lara Mendona, who led the design of Bumble’s dating app (BMBL) is set to join Twitter (TWTR) as a senior manager of product design.
* Tesla Inc has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub due to uncertainty created by tensions between the US and China, people familiar to the matter told Reuters.
* Boeing (BA) reported 737 MAX jet deliveries fell to just four airplanes in April from 19 the previous month, as the best-selling aircraft struggles with an electrical problem that has re-grounded part of the fleet. The planemaker started delivering the 737 MAX to airlines in December nearly two years after the jet returned to service following a lengthy safety ban, following two high profile accidents.
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials regarding the semiconductor shortage that has resulted in production cuts, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.

n958n7,,StockMarket,post,1620655565,"I analyzed 9000+ trades made by U.S Senators in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.P**reamble:** The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

https://preview.redd.it/ir6jqgjwsay61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d057f55015d8e25479815bfe760d4dde81240de6

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

https://preview.redd.it/mnijwbqwsay61.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=828da0f685646a73946097f6b0dd86f753de024b

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

https://preview.redd.it/95cl91nwsay61.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ffc2fc430e5b7f3157ae4f264872d3ef95a0b2

If you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/75nyoa5ltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5b27919716360fdbaf31f4548f4d21e0401b49

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/xing6reltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9c3d13abbb8b060fecf8cee7b312bbdfd6efaf

These are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades

https://preview.redd.it/k4r34rpusay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=084ac821754d87d42d2f1ac9b822a9015125a443

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/igyz3jwdvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=223b91d21b9201211a21ea24ec2daee0627b9166

The top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators

https://preview.redd.it/fd66tjagvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e92ab79c5b7316eb95e70dc22bed0b2f8615127

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

Edit: 

> There are two chambers in the legislative branch: Senate and House. Not all of these people are “senators” as you describe. 

I mistakenly classified all of the trades under the broad term of Senators! This is a mixture of trades done by both houses. So please keep this in mind while reading the post. Apologies again as politics is not really my strong suit. ","['TSLA', 'GOOGL', 'SPGI', 'MSFT']"

na8yo0,,StockMarket,post,1620770402,"I'm having trouble with this> NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks hit a one-month low on  Tuesday as speculation that rising inflation pressure could prompt  interest rate hikes sooner rather than later dragged on shares and  hobbled the dollar, which hovered near a 2-1/2-month low. 

We woke up this morning to learn that inflation, that we've been hearing about for months, is really scary today, and the price of gold dropped. Inflation means the buying power of the dollar will fall and investors sold gold and, essentially, bought dollars so they could ride the loss down. That's not the way it worked in 1979 when the inflation and interest rates were 11%. Gold went up 120%. For gold and bitcoin to drop, now, doesn't make sense. 

At the end of the day, inflation wasn't so scary after all, gold rose and half my holdings ended in the green. It's an improvement for me, but still... If it isn't scary in the afternoon, it wasn't scary in the morning. It smells off.

I'm calling bullshit on inflation fears and I'm all in on the dip. I'm damned certain that I'm not holding onto dollars through an inflationary period. I'll rethink this when interest rates hit 15%, again.",

My opinion is that the downward pressures on growth stocks will show that this growth rally is a dead-cat bounce, and we'll see prices lower by the end of the week.  Please note I am 24 years old and will generally bet on tech, not against it.

nbdztx,,wallstreetbets,post,1620903726,"Why potential inflation could lead to a financial crisis?**A bit of history**

The decade of the 2000s may have been a pretty good decade in many aspects, movies such as the lord of the rings or harry potter were released; music albums such as The Strokes' ""Is this It"" or Bob Dylan's ""Modern Times"" were released. Nevertheless, this decade was not a good one in economic terms. This decade started with the dotcom crash, which was triggered by the rise and fall of technology stocks. And, this was not the only remarkable economic event of this decade, when the economy seemed to have recovered from this crisis, another crisis broke out, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, triggered by the collapse of the housing market in the U.S. All these economic turbulences can be clearly seen in the evolution of the S&P500 between 2000 and 2010 as shown in Figure 1.

[Figure 1. S&P500 \(2000 -2010\)](https://preview.redd.it/6g7jwgdjnuy61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddf64cd6bce2330521f414c2533359a5ca76ac8)

**A time of low interest rates**

Moreover, these economic disturbances led governments to act severely. Keynesian policies for the activation of the economy began to play a fundamental role. To encourage consumption, interest rates were lowered to near historic lows. Figure 2 displays the US 10 year note bond yield between 1920 and 2020. In this figure, we can see how the dotcom crash pushed down this yield. However, after that it started recovering until July 2007, when the financial crisis started, after that, that yield continued a downward trend.

[Figure 2. US 10 Year Note Bond Yield](https://preview.redd.it/p7mnvg3gduy61.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd8e007d5d740cf3bd371bc53dba2a8a59df93d)

**Stocks as the only attractive investment vehicle**

Such a long period of low interest rates inflated stock prices. Figure 3, shows how cyclically adjusted S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio has been rising during the last decade, being quite high in comparison to other periods of time (specially before the dot-com bubble). Stock prices started trading at a premium, because there were no attractive alternative investments, this channelled much of the liquidity into equities (bonds with almost no interest or even negative interests were not an attractive investment anymore). Hence, low interest rates justify high stock prices, since stocks are highly attractive relative to bonds.

[Figure 3: Cyclically adjusted S&P 500 price-to-earnings rations](https://preview.redd.it/9al89cizwuy61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a21d3c6b829fdb2c9427c653a7da1421bfb274)

**An unexpected event: A global pandemic**

2020 was not a good year, this year will always be remembered as the year of the COVID. COVID brought many changes in our lives, which undoubtedly had an impact on the economy.    As a result, governments continued to pursue stimulative policies and interest rates remained at very low levels. 

One of the best illustrations of those stimulative policies is the amount of dollars printed in 2020: 21% of the United States dollar was printed in 2020, as shown in Figure 4. This large injection was used for both direct and indirect assistance in the COVID situation. This, at the same time, indirectly channelled part of this aid to the financial markets, increasing their value.

[Figure 4. Annual Money Stock Growth \(Trillions of USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/l0c36b3gzuy61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf093aa9e839d942d3f65b3a9f875b37858e060c)

**A  double-edged sword**

Injecting money to the economy is always something controversial. Through the law of supply and demand it is easy to infer that a considerable increase in supply (without a similar increase in demand) will reduce the price of a good.  In money, when this happens, we say that the money loses value, i.e. one monetary unit can acquire fewer products. In other words, this is what we call inflation. Even Warren Buffet has shown concern for inflation in the past month:

> ""**We are seeing very substantial inflation \[...\] We are raising prices. People are raising prices to us and it’s being accepted.”** 

This raise on prices can be  already tracked on several indices such as Bloomberg's agriculture index, shown in Figure 5 and also in the annual single-family home price, as shown in Figure 6.

&#x200B;

[Figure 5. Bloomberg agriculture index](https://preview.redd.it/ad6oocg86vy61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=145f863fb092b97f061d7cff98b2b3361a519ac9)

[Figure 6. Annual Single-family home price \(extracted from: https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-05-11\/u-s-home-prices-surge-the-most-on-record-in-buying-frenzy?sref=RJ2RlMrh\)](https://preview.redd.it/5oc8mgum6vy61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=558de3a89d40db8d9c9a511318ebb4e9178ebbdc)

The appearance of inflation means that interest rates should rise. Something that was already pointed by Janet Yellen at the start of this month:

> **“It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat”** 

But what would happen if inflation persists and interest rates have to be risen? Remember that I previously said that stocks are trading at a premium due to the lack of attractive alternative investments. This would no longer be true and this premium would no longer be a thing. And, thus, we should expect a decrease in the stock price.

**The market can not be timed**

Even with all these indicators, it is difficult to say whether this will happen in the short to medium term. There are many factors which could deter inflation away and interest rates low. As an example, Berkshire Hathaway has been stacking cash during the last years, as shown in Figure 7, playing a slightly more defensive position. This may be due the fact that they already saw that low interest rates during the last decade were driving the stock market at high prices. However, interest rates are still low and during that time the stock market has continued rising.

[Figure 7. Berkshire's Cash Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/3ag5lqt6cvy61.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91b8be62cb599332c4c1404ef878e6dcf6529a3)

**Summary**

* The first decade of the 2000s was characterized by two economic crisis, which defined an economy with very low interest rates 
* Low interest rates increased stock market prices, since there were no attractive alternative investments and, thus, stock markets traded at a premium.
* The Covid crisis led to a massive injection of money into the economy. 
* This money injection is a double-edged sword which may have brought an exuberance illusion awakening a ghost that has been dormant in recent years, inflation.
* The emergence of inflation would imply an increase in interest rates.
* An increase in interest rates would mean that the premium paid for stocks would be lost.
* Despite all these facts, timing the market is no easy task. And thus, other factors could keep inflation away and interest rates away, prolonging this situation.","['SPGI', 'BRK.B']"

nbjmaq,,wallstreetbets,post,1620920598,"Corsair (CRSR) Double Down - It's TimeAlright alright, I've been bullish since before Sir_Jack_A_Lot jumped in and I've lost my shirt with shares. I also bought LOGI thanks /u/1xndsu which have done well. I'm learning to sell covered calls and buy puts with my premiums to make up for some losses. However, I believe it's time for Corsair to breakout. I would really appreciate anyone's bearish sentiment to explain further downward price action. Here is my DD thesis:  
  
Using most recent closed price, $31.39  

1. Financials:
2020 sales (1.7 billion) with a GP of 465MM.  
TTM: 1.92 billion with a GP of 547MM  
The current market cap is 2.9Billion.  
2021 estimates: As per Andy Paul (CEO) and Michael Potter (CFO) who have always been conservative with their estimates:  
2021 sales estimate: $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, representing growth of 11.6% to 23.4%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $235 million to $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $245 million to $265 million.  
Most recent quarter:  
Q1 revenue of $529MM with an adjusted net income of 58.2MM. EPS beat of $0.58 vs the $0.33 estimate, a 75% beat. They also paid down 10% of their debt (which now stands at 300MM) which means 1MM more is guaranteed next year.

2. Growth:
WHAT????? Q1 beat Q4? They beat ""stay at home, winter time, holiday time, holiday sales revenue"" which was 53MM. What does this mean? They are still selling and will continue to sell even though COVID gave them a nice boost. Furthermore, hardware and gaming peripherals quarters are their weakest in Q1. With growing quarters this year, their EPS for 2021 will be a minimum of 2.5 giving Corsair a P/E ratio of 12.5 for a company growing 100% YOY and expected to continue at 20% YOY. They beat Q1 estimates of 75%. This will continue this year. Recession or not.  
Ultimate growth: DDR5. Corsair has the #1 market share in memory sales.   
https://www.corsair.com/us/en/blog/ddr5-primer    
""We’ll be adding significant resources to the company this year, both in marketing and R&D as well as infrastructure as we move towards a $2 billion revenue number."" Boom. They're choosing to pay more for growth rather than just buying down debt. They believe in themselves and so does EagleTree, the majority shareholder. They also just signed a new, three year lease on a brand new campus with a lot more room. Finally, their Glassdoor reviews are finally bullish again (they used to suck). Yes, I even look at Glassdoor reviews when going all in on a company.    
I recommend you read MC's article, 18 Words From Corsair Gaming CEO Could Spell Monster Returns for Investors. Where Andy Paul said, ""The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.""  


3. Technicals:
Okay, they suck. Triple MACD crossover, lack of support, but when has that ever stopped any of you retards? Food for thought, this stock is down 31% after it has had TWO quarterly earning beats. It's been lumped in with other overpriced tech stocks and has been hit very hard. We see $30.50 as a solid support level, you cannot go wrong unless you put everything into call options.

4. Insiders Trading? 
Michael Potter: CFO Sold 1.25% of his shares, 7,500 shares of his 600,000 shares. Good for him, he made some tendies and I hope he buys a lambo.  
Thi L La: COO. Purchased 100,000 shares at $32.64. He literally spent 3.25 million betting on the company he may know more about than anyone else. It is only fair to note that he sold 100k shares at $35 in January in a public offering. We can only assume it was to buy GME with us and jump back in later, right?  

5. Institutions will start buying again:  
Round 2 for institutions and ETFs. When scratching my head and pondering why prices dropped, and as new reports are emerging, it is clear that many of the initial IPO investors (like JP Morgan) have sold. I mean cmon, they made 100% return on 10's of millions in investments. Meanwhile, new institutions are tapping in from the ER beats, some even increasing positions, and going heavy on call options. Finally, 180 days have now passed, which some institutions and ETFs consider a waiting period before buying into an equity.  

6. Analysts and Other Technical Articles:  
Don't trust the random, unknown guy from Reddit? Trust every article published in the past three months. Show me one negative or bearish article. Finally, analysts have an average PT of $46.67 with Barclays giving it a $47. Not one has it as a sell. ""Screaming Buy"" some articles call it. 39% return in 12 months! How spoiled are you not to jump on near 40% return in a company that distributes products that you actually would like to own.  

7. Possibilities: these depend on EagleTree Partners. If anyone knows someone who works there, hit me up.  
Buyout: EagleTree owns 67% of the shares. That's funny because equity buyouts often exceed 60% ownership. A big if, but they could potentially sell to someone which would make some millionaires here.  
Short Squeeze (more like a hug). The float is 88.13MM shares. Meanwhile, EagleTree owns 61.99MM of those shares. Assuming EagleTree does not add more to the float, there is a 17.2% SI based on the most recent SI report from Nasdaq. However, millions of shares were shorted from tech sell off as well as last earnings report, could be as high as 21%. Meanwhile, days to cover IS OVER 7! No, no, not a short squeeze, but it could cause some covers from the shorts that were taken back in the $40's.  

TDLR: Financials are great. Company is growing. Analysts are all bullish. Some possible moon scenarios. Everyone here says, ""Corsair will have its day"" but why not make that happen today, not tomorrow.

I am not wed to opinions of economic activity or inflation and how they may steer markets. I am  not self-proclaimed bulls or bears. 

 Quite often, investors are rewarded for going against the crowd, especially when the masses are in agreement on what the future holds. 

 Despite  extraordinary circumstances, the level of confidence in economic and market forecasts is remarkably high. Many “experts” forecast beautiful days with a temporary bout of above-average inflation. There is nary a mention of the potential for debilitating inflation and almost no recognition of the troubling deflationary hurricane off at sea. 

 **The confidence and hubris backing forecasts should be of great concern, not comfort.** 

The Butterfly Effect

In 1963, Edward Lorenz, a meteorology professor from MIT, wrote a white paper called *Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow*. 

Per the essence of his work is that “***small  changes can have large consequences****.*” His logic is better known as the Butterfly Effect.

  *“Lorenz suggested that the flap of a butterfly’s wings might ultimately cause a tornado. And the butterfly effect, also known as “sensitive dependence on initial conditions,” has a profound corollary:* ***forecasting the future can be nearly impossible****.”* 

 *“Yet Lorenz’s own deterministic equations demonstrated how easily the dream of perfect knowledge founders in reality.* ***That the tiny change in his simulation mattered so much showed, by extension, that the imprecision inherent in any human measurement could become magnified into wildly incorrect forecasts.”*** 

The Fed has charged the investment atmosphere. Today’s investors view markets as get rich quick schemes. Stories of investors turning thousands into hundreds of thousands litter social media. The problem is that such behavior is not natural nor sustainable. It relies on ever-growing amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, which are not sustainable.

 Why is this? Significant consideration must be excessive monetary policy and how it reduces the level of perceived risk. Investors are blinded as the Fed has more than doubled the money supply in less than a year. The result is massive amounts of liquidity infiltrating the asset markets. Further, investors, rightly or wrongly, firmly believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to prop up ailing markets. 

There is another vital aspect. Capitalism provides better living standards for more people when it is most efficiently run. A core component of capitalism is how productively capital is used.  **Ask yourself, is capital being deployed most productively?**

The casino may stay open for a while longer, so enjoy it while it lasts. Make no mistake, the doors will close, and gamblers will be trapped.

 *Bulls win in Bull Markets; Bears win in Bear Markets. Eagles soar above and take advantage of opportunity.  

I am Neither Bull nor Bear abt stocks , bonds, currencies . Actually since I stop fighting with Fed and surrounded and bought Physcial silver just to protect my fortune .*

This time is not different!

I'm of the belief it is transitory because frankly theres nothing we can gauge this off of. There's never been a nationwide or shit even worldwide lockdown.  We are coming off a near year of pent up demand all the while a good majority of people just sat on their money or put it into the market and grew their wealth.  Now every day that goes by another part of the country opens up so people want to spend money on frivolous shit after being locked up for a year (yes I'm being hyperbolic but the sentiment stands) all the while we haven't ramped up production to meet those needs.  So yeah inflation will go up in the short term since obviously wages arent going up.  

There's all kinds of reasons to agree or disagree with the feds assessment until we learn what the truth is I'm just going to keep rolling with TLT puts until the fed says something about raising rates.  Its free money at this point.",

nauo06,,wallstreetbets,post,1620841412,"Does anyone else feel nervous as hell about making any substantial moves right now?Now I'm not one for risk management (or any form of management), but I am having a hell of a hard time doing anything bullish or bearish. Just hear me out:

* Gaymestronk could get cut in half or double in price in 10 minutes at any given moment
* tech stocks are bleeding like a knife wound but can have random 10% days (not to mention the hundreds of stocks with no P/E *at all* doing wild swings)
* lockdowns still doing weird shit
* gas shortage panics while michigan is trying to cut off the Canadian-US pipeline
* middle east conflicts starting up fast
* month-to-month inflation is 4.2%, fed is still keeping interest rates low as balls on a hedgehog
* memecoin values are based on hopes that a dude talks about them on a sketch show
* notable hedge funds are liquidating
* building materials are tripling in cost over the month
* and we have an actual unmet labor demand while new stimmies are being sent out

And while all this is happening, SPY is up 39%, DIA is up 39%, Nasdaq is up over 42% over the last 12 months. I don't think many people would disagree with the fact that the market is generally overvalued right now. But, if you buy puts, you can expect those to bleed out and let some market maker run off with your money while you sit there hoping for a drop (ew). But of course you know its all built on a house of cards, so a call will either bleed or get wiped on an overnight swing. Companies can beat earnings estimates by 50% and drop the next day because it's ""priced in"" and mid-market companies with a huge run up will start issuing shares the second they get the chance.

nbks5t,,wallstreetbets,post,1620923551,"PLTR: Two Huge Catalysts That No One is Talking About (DD)Credit to r/Ryanj928

Okay listen up Palantards. Within the next two weeks, we have the potential to see two contracts being awarded to Palantir that most likely will have bring in roughly $750 million or more to Palantir's total deal value. THIS IS HUGE! As of Q1 2021, Palantir's total deal value was $2.8 billion, so this potential deal value of $750 million would be 26.8% of Palantir's total deal value. This type of news brings further shock to the growth that Palantir is experiencing, and with their margins only getting better, this will drastically improve the cash flow of this company.

​

So what are the Catalysts?

1:) The FDIC's Rapid Phased Prototyping Competition - This competition was started in August of 2020 when the FDIC formally invited 33 companies to submit a concept that would help update the old, cumbersome software that FDIC banks were using to report information, financial risks, integrate data; All on a cloud-based platform that ultimately will host end-to-end supervision processes. Exactly what Palantir does. This competition has been ongoing, and Palantir, unsurprisingly, was selected as 1 out of the 11 finalists for the competition. These companies presented their last demo days in March, and one company is expected to get the contract that could run 7.5 years and total up to $487.5 million. This contract can be expanded into additional work, and could generate more revenue if Palantir is awarded the contract. Based off the FDIC's timeline for the RPP competition, it seems they are expecting to make a decision before the end of the month, since the competitors showed their final prototype back in mid-March and the timeline has been moving in two month intervals.

​

2:) The Renewal of the U.S. Special Operations Command Contract - This was previously Palantir's largest ever contract before the U.S Army contract in 2019. This contract was valued $277,500,00 and was a 5 year contract that was awarded in 2016 that is set to expire on May 25th. Based off Palantir's reputation in the DoD, its reasonable to say that Palantir is the best competitor for this project and will most likely be given a renewal contract by the U.S Special Ops Command. This renewal will most likely be a larger contract, due to natural COG rising and potential to be involved in other areas of software for the agency. But this contract will certainly be announced on/before May 25th and will be a huge number for investors to read. Although this is just a renewal, this is a HUGE renewal, one of their largest ever.

​

Conclusion: These two catalysts will provide a strong argument to showcase Palantir's dominance in data analytics, and show itself as the only competitor capable of handling data safely and efficiently in the world. I strongly believe that these two catalysts will be huge momentum for the company itself (not just the stock) and will further confirm our eventual destination to the moon. With Palantir finally getting passed the profitability marker, deals like this will cement that profitability and hurl it from being branded as an unprofitable, 17 year old company to one that is quickly increasing cash flow by the multiple. Those who are value traders/professionals and use models, you understand how this will change the stock price. This will be a once in a decade company and I fully am behind it.

My models currently show a $29 PT, but this number will greatly change within the next quarter, especially when inflation fears reside.",['COG']

nb2q6d,,wallstreetbets,post,1620862483,"OMG! Inflation.Soooo... let me get this straight.. we're selling our assets because we think the threat of inflation is worse than what the Fed is making it out to be? 

Fair, on being skeptical on the Fed's downplaying this.. But! Last time I checked, inflation isn't where asset values deflate, they inlfate. It's the currency that loses value. Not assets, especially assets that are known to hedge against inflation. If inflation is your threat, converting assets into currency seems a bit, ironic to say the least..

Conclusion: To me, the market's response is overreactive. We got a lot of new investors and traders out there. Including me. But, the key is understanding the driving force behind inflation along with it's cause/effect.

I don't know about you but, I'm buying the dip. Especially inflation hedges. As the old saying goes.. ""Buy into weakness, sell into strength."". Pullbacks are Bullish~ No, Stonks don't always go up. Once the panic selling slows.. this is screaming buy if you ask me.

Not financial advice. Just my thoughts.

Peace~

Update:

Negative rates are a thing. It's all the rage in Europe, for the last couple years.

I am not saying this WILL happen but, for those hopping on the raise in the Fed Funds Rate bandwagon.. when everything the Fed has been saying for months on end is that there is no foreseeable change in policy, potentially as far out as 3 years..

I ask, rhetorically.. What do you think the US Fed will do.. Follow suit with the rest of the Central Banks of the world in Negative Federal rates or go out on a limb and raise the Fed Funds Rate?

Place your bets accordingly~

I don't believe that the US Fed has the balls to raise rates with how huge the bubble is today. We are way beyond 2008. Think about it.. if you were Jerome Powell would you want to be the guy to pull that trigger? I don't think so. He's probably peeing in his pants right now since the market is forcing his hand to do something. I know I would be pissing into a puddle of my tears if I were him. Talk about pressure!

I think Jerome Powell will more than likely try to buy himself time by increasing asset purchases for the next 8 months and serve his term as safe as possible. Then, pass the buck off to the next face puppet Chairmen. Meaning he'll keep rates the way they are or lower them into the negative by .25%. Or at least adjust assets purchases and a negative rate by how much investors freak out. Powell isn't the type to grab the Bull by the horns, if you will. So, mild fluctuations in Fed policy at best.

I just don't think our Fed is smart nor brave enough to take the controlled fire approach and raise rates. Not yet anyways.. Especially, when we're not seeing rates rising with the Central Banks of the world. If anything, they're willing to go into the negative from what I've seen, not assume. Which, assumption is the entire basis of the argument of those who think they'll raise rates.

Just my two cents though. This is a fantastic discussion btw~

Consider the following — the market is a discounting mechanism. Future cash flows are eroded when the discount rate increases. Treasury yields are a component of the discount rate. Further, inflation reduces the purchasing power of the US dollar, which means investors would demand more cash flows to achieve the same nominal returns considering inflation.",

nbfs3x,,wallstreetbets,post,1620909888,"Why would a bank enter in a Reverse REPO with the FED at 0% when the Interest On Excess Reserves is at 0.10%?You can see [here](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000)  the REPO and Reverse REPO operations done with the FED. From the FED  point of view, in a REPO, they lend money to a counterparty that gives a  Bond as guarantee, in a Reverse REPO, the FED borrows liquidity from a  counterparty in exchange for a Bond. For example, yesterday, 39  counterparties lent to the FED 209 Billions at 0%.

As you can see in the link, there are counterparties that lend to the FED at 0%. But why would they do that when the [Interest On Excess Reserves](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm)  is positive at 0.10%? Couldn't they just park the cash as reserves held  by the FED gaining 0.10% instead of lending to the FED at 0%? Am I  missing something?",
nbfs3x,gxz1tzf,wallstreetbets,comment,1620911099,So that they can get the bonds and short it.,
nbfs3x,gxz4o1e,wallstreetbets,comment,1620912534,"Overnight repo has gone negative recently, so some firms (who are eligible) want to lock in the 0% for overnight lending instead of going to the others in the market and potentially get charged. Only banks have reserve accounts at the Fed, thus only them, can get paid IOER since only banks have access to Fed reserves. 

If you have spare cash and want to adjust your holdings to hold less cash and more of other highly-liquid stuff like Treasuries (like money market funds) you head to the repo market. Normally you'd get paid but since banks, hedge funds don't need this extra cash (they are sitting on trillions of excess reserves and turning away deposits), you're left with fewer options. The best is 0%.

  
This is also why the Fed is expected to raise the reverse repo rate so it wouldn't fall before 0 like it has in April.

Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by Congress who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades) 

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately. 

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end. 

**Analysis:**

**Distribution of Trades**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kh4ythn8roy61.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=c054d4e698ab159a8b4fdd3cdaa88e8a3ea2fb43)

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the Congress Members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made the Congress. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some Congress members are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a. One Month 

b. One Quarter 

c. Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns of Congress Members vs S&P500**

https://preview.redd.it/j5lejvpdroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4edea1cb42cac7ecab4e9e6c5b034ace5d9ac566

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress members did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark. 

**Returns if you followed their trades**

https://preview.redd.it/rnuw3kyhroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ea3a1ab53fd502a2968939891bd11e9da84c8a

If you had invested in the stocks Congress Members bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit. 

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted answered was which were the best trades made by Congress Members over the last 2 years. 

**Best trades made by U.S Congress Members**  


[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0xatcb5rroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d157bba30bcd309db66bd51ababcf36e7c76710c)

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Congress Members were successful as shown below. 

**Worst trades made by U.S Congress Members**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/dfsg5lksroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c41517d7299e6b62cbd6dfa1bbdf42a672d750)

These are the worst trades made by Congress Members with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period. Brain Mast also makes an appearance in the worst trades making him a prime candidate for some WSB loss porn.  

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered Congress Members having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades. 

**U.S Congress Members having the highest returns**  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/7yk3wa4wroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad6ae5de91e6ec8ade045378e72983dee356b0c)

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Congress Members comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. Next thing I looked is the Congress Members that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.

**U.S Congress Members having the highest amount invested in stocks**

https://preview.redd.it/x4vb26xxroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c34019c2a724babc40a9823ec513e7a69e562aaf

The top 3 Congress Members as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S Congress Members 

**Most popular stocks among US Congress**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/t4vv63s1soy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=327b56f8cbfff8465b09e797272a45ccde46429c)

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have $100B+ valuation. 

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

a. The time period of analysis is 2 years on which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in market downturn/recession 

b. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to it (you can find it in the Google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress Members. 

c. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range. 

**Conclusion:** 

This analysis proves that Congress Members indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader's judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Congress Members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

nbgqp3,,wallstreetbets,post,1620912801,"Why the stock market is falling now.First the easy quarterly comparisons are gone.  It used to be pre covid numbers vs post covid numbers.  If you're in AMZN or ZM or SHOP.  You know what I mean  Its been a year.  They are gone.  The comparisons are tough now.

Second analysts estimates are catching up to reality.  The earnings beats used to be huge!  Jaw dropping really.  But now they are quite modest.  Still beats but just barely.

Trades are crowded and position sizes are all overweighted.  Today when earning are reported, beats don't move the stocks the way that they used to.  Why?  Because not only does everyone already own the stock, (no one left to buy it) they own way more of it than they should.  Why? Because 1/2 the world was shut down by covid.  The viable trades that remained became very crowded and over owned.  Portfolio managers seeing difficult comparisons and modest earnings beats now are selling into strength to reduce exposure to over owned overexposed positions.  Saas stocks and home shopping stocks are great examples.  Terrific earnings terrible charts.

Recovery stocks ran up BIG BIG BIG.  But now as earnings are being reported we see that absolutely nothing is going on anywhere in recovery names.  Hotels, airlines, Casinos.  Zip zip zip.  Nothing to see here folks move along.  This certainly stifled new buys maybe even induced some selling.

Where is the money going?  Right now it looks like the money pulled is being parked in some select REITs and Utility stocks for brief periods.  From there it is being scattered broadly into recovery names vertically.  So if you like airlines as a recovery theme.  You buy engine makers.  Parts suppliers.  ect all the way through the supply chains.  You are trying to avoid crowded trades and seek value buys in soon to be recovering industries. 

This is a transition.  The recovery has not been canceled.  Stock picking still matters.",['AMZN']

TLDR at the bottom as well as sources. Graphs along the way. Enjoy :)

 General information about Medicare directly from cms.gov:

# Medicare Program - General Information

### Medicare is a health insurance program for:

* ^(People age 65 or older.)
* ^(People under age 65 with certain disabilities.)
* ^(People of all ages with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant).)

### Medicare has different parts that help cover specific services:

**Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) -** Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these benefits. Most people don't pay a premium for Part A because they or a spouse already paid for it through their payroll taxes while working.

**Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) -** Part B helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part B.

**Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage) -** Medicare prescription drug coverage is available to everyone with Medicare. To get Medicare prescription drug coverage, people must join a plan approved by Medicare that offers Medicare drug coverage. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part D.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

Private insurance companies offer benefits in addition to original Medicare in the form of a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan. A recipient will enroll in either a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan, they can't have both.  Below you'll see Q4 2020 enrollments including Med Sup and MA, you'll see there is a far larger market share for supplements than advantage plans. $CLOV only offers MA, they do not offer supplements which was . 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But that data is from 2016.... it's the most recent I could find. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage (MA) continues to grow at a steady rate as more (more than 8% last year) and more Americans are entering retirement. Yet, only 43% of the nearly 63 million people eligible for Medicare are enrolled in a MA in 2020. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xh4wkhjbfwy61.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=4535ec64a83101f560f9c095fa293c6d0829c01f

**Medicare Advantage is a GROWING market, but does that growth have room for $CLOV as a major player?** I don't see it. As you'll see below the large companies make up most of the market share in the Medicare Advantage space, and they do it well. That 18% of ""all other insurers"" is where $CLOV fits into the graph below. What concerns me about $CLOV is that a majority of those ""other"" companies are not-for-profit and affiliated with small networks and hospital group. Why is $CLOV operating for profit and publicly traded in this space. The SEC has questions as well. Red flags. 

https://preview.redd.it/1agsakcmfwy61.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce2403669147e7715b6f7aa32bd2b7550a727e3

The major carries include many extra benefits that seniors love, especially the fitness membership benefits included on most of the major plans. Looking through Clovers website I only saw dental/vision/hearing benefit included. These are usually a small reimbursement or a percentage discount for services and not comprehensive benefits you would expect. 

https://preview.redd.it/mbmrmc5xfwy61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a59d811d8cb6968e1a4b875cf8ecc29e3d66e9

Speaking of their website, it is very generic. See for yourself: [https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/plans](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/plans)

Compare it to other major carriers: [https://www.humana.com/](https://www.humana.com/) [https://www.aarpmedicareplans.com/](https://www.aarpmedicareplans.com/) 

[https://www.aetnaseniorproducts.com/ssi/index.html](https://www.aetnaseniorproducts.com/ssi/index.html)

Decide for yourself as a customer which you'd feel the most comfortable with. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**They're a 3 star company y'all, what are you buying?**

Again, major carriers are doing well in this space, and they're benefiting from doing well. $CLOV claims on their website that they are doing healthcare differently but their model is exactly the same as every other carrier with fewer features and benefits than most. Their customer service must be amazing then, right? Luckily the CMS measures this in the form of a star rating they assign to each carrier every year. As part of a Medicare Advantage appointment we are required to review a companies Star Rating with the member. The Star rating is a score provide by CMS that assess customer service and quality of care. You'll see below that the star rating is an increasingly important factor in enrollment, and that 78% of enrollments are in plans with 4 for more star.

https://preview.redd.it/0slqosx8gwy61.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a930f0fb874df4190b69cfe5d60b42ff47dc59

You'll see Clovers most recent star rating below. They have a 3 and 3.5 star rating, which is not attractive to the consumer at all. As a broker I would be concerned, if the consumer isn't happy with the plan they might switch to a different plan next year with a different broker. I want my clients to have a positive experience with the plan they enroll in, I want them to tell their friends, I want their referrals. I would caution enrolling a customer in a 3 star plan.

https://preview.redd.it/ggf42tmdgwy61.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=282dcfea99c4f6f3e12229793db1f81b217d0b01

**Oh and there's that thing about them being approved as a direct contracting entity, that must be big news, right?** No, do you even know what that means. Let me explain. This is basically a pilot program that 53 carriers are participating in throughout the country. 53 is a lot btw. When a customer enrolls in a MA plan they have to designate their primary care physician (PCP). Under the direct contracting model the MA plan will pay the PCP a specific dollar amount per member, like a membership. In return the doctor will provide services to the member but not charge the plan per service, since they are receiving payment for care upfront overtime. This is basically to see if this model is more cost effective than the fee-for-service model. The customer will still received itemized statements as they would under the traditional fee-for-service model. So essential the customer doesn't notice anything different is happening, other then they likely will not have a copay or possibly a lower copay. But this doesn't make $CLOV unique in any way.

**TLDR: Clover Health Investments is not doing anything of value in the Medicare Space. I'm sorry but your bags look heavy.**

nb82yy,,wallstreetbets,post,1620878983,"Take a Trip with MindMedAlright, we don’t have much time; the Adderall is wearing off and I have a lot to type. Put this on your tongue and listen up. The topic for discussion today is MindMed:MNMD. I don’t want to lose anyone when it starts kicking in, so I’m going to break it up into sections. Also, obvious disclaimer, this is not financial advice, I’m just a drug addict.

TL;DR MNMD is bottoming out for its first time after hitting NASDAQ, and it looks like its ramping up to it's next peak.

First off, if you don’t know already (and if you don’t know, I don’t know how the fuck you got here in the first place) MindMed is a Canadian based company researching medical treatments for depression, drug addiction, depression, PTSD, and pain utilizing psychedelics and other entactogenic substances like MDMA. Mental health treatment is suffering from a severe lack of highly successful treatments and will be seeing a massive increase in attention due to the growing global acceptance of mental disorders. The other area of focus is pain; one of the largest markets for pharmacological substances. And, thanks to the opioid epidemic, many jurisdictions are open to finding alternative treatments for pain at *any* cost simply to save lives. Highly scrutinizing the sale of one of the largest revenue-generating pain medications leaves a bit of demand in its wake, as not only doctors but politicians and citizens are looking for a safer drug for physical pain. Not to mention, how are we going to continue to treat all of the individuals who became addicted to these substances due to malpractice? Welcome, MindMed. That’s right, there’s hope to get mental health on track, physical pain managed, and addiction to those previous substances all treated with *one* class of drug. Psychedelics.

So yes, that’s a lot of good news. “What’s the downside?”, you may be wondering. “I saw a bearish sentiment that the psychedelic market is gonna be a bloodbath! They’re all using the same drugs.” Yeah, yeah, shut the fuck up. This fucking company has patents – *already has patents* – for an LSD trip neutralizing agent. Ever been tripping balls and wanted nothing but the room to stop breathing and you mom to give you a nice glass of milk? *This* is that nice glass of milk. No psychiatrist is going to want their patients to feel side effects of their treatment, if using high doses, for any longer than necessary during the appointment. It would be a terrible idea. Make a mistake and take more than prescribed (yes, it does happen to people who aren’t drug addicts like I am)? Having a neutralizing agent for such a long lasting drug is *necessary* and already patented by this company. I’m just getting fucking started.

Ever heard of the state Oregon? Yeah, me neither. But it turns out they legalized the sale and purchase of psilocybin containing mushrooms recreationally (Edit: Okay I've been corrected and this was a lil bit of an oversight. They weren't legalized recreationally, use is only permitted in specific therapeutic situations. However, most(?) drug possession is decriminalized which is a step in the right direction. Leaving the original because it's funny in retrospect). Those same drugs that everyone talks about in pop-culture from music to current movies? That the entire public is so intrigued with right now? Once one state legalizes, its only a matter of time before more catch on. In fact, California is attempting to pass legislation for the possession and sale of mushrooms. The state with the *largest* recreational drug market. If all of this wasn’t enough already, I don’t know why you’ve gotten this far. But that’s only why everyone should *obviously* have bullish sentiment for this company. Now’s time for me to show you my pretty graphs.

[MindMed Peaks](https://preview.redd.it/14dr9cx1bty61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d046dc0b4213fcf1ddb90d889ecbf2fda157f572)

Notice the volume April 27 of this year. That’s the day it got listed to Nasdaq. If you can’t find it, I’ll make it easy. It’s the largest volume bar. Now it’s obvious volume would be much, much higher in its opening days on the exchange. The numbers are staggering, though. In the first five days trading on Nasdaq, MindMed volume was about 160 million… over half of it’s float and about 8 weeks worth of average volume from when it was a penny stock. Interest in the company continues to increase from media attention, people are buying up the float fast, and… price is falling. In fact, the price is currently about 75% of it’s highest peak as a penny stock, and half it’s debut open. After rising above the $2 point in late 2020, price has never gone below that. Current support looks like it doesn’t want to fall too far below $3 now. This will most likely be the lowest price for the next few months, if not ever if we go off historical data. So that’s all well and good but… Where’s it going next?

Drawing the most conservative extension lines for the original $5 price movement and following retracement from December 2020 until April of this year, Fibonacci retracements would have be able to be used to predict a 100% retracement of $5.69. And what was the upper extreme for the next price movement? $5.77.

Notice the price increase entering, and maintaining, support at the 23.6% extension line, about $2.93. This is the current price, riding the 23.6% extension line and refusing to stay below for the past WTD. That’s all well and good, but that price movement already happened. So how about extension lines from the most recent peak and retracement?

Ahh, that’s more like it. Because this has all occurred in the same uptrend, I kept a similar start point for the price movement. If we predict the exact momentum as last time, The price should reach about $7.80 at it’s next peak. However, notice that each peak has gotten higher and higher. While there was a long retracement and profit taking period, MindMed is actually still on the same uptrend that started in late 2020. So $7.80 is a safe guess, but it might have the momentum this time to hit the next extension -- $10.85. Those are some juicy profits. Especially when the first options ever traded for MindMed expire May 21 with the highest strike point at $7.5. *Beneath* the historically expected price movement. If risk isn’t your thing, the $5 strike point options would be incredible profit at even the lowest extension point.

Here’s the profit spread on those 7.5 strike calls at 100 contracts:

$500 is dirt cheap when the higher end of the price movement could net 5 digits. “But why is there reason to believe it would hit that price point before expiration?” I’m glad you asked.

&#x200B;

Behold, the most beautiful graph I have ever laid my eyes on. Using Fibonacci time extensions on the two previous price increases, we get a two day range predicting the next peak, given that both extensions are drawn from the two greatest peaks. Despite such a different time frame, both of these extensions are 100% extensions, based on time, from both of the last peaks in price. Right before those first options expire. Not only that, but drawing an oval to visualize an upside down parabola. The slope of the price decrease following the last increase rides along the slope of the oval pictured. When in this type of price formation, generally the slope of the line will leave the parabola at the same slope it entered following it’s second touch on the right side, after the trend has reversed upwards. The graph already touched once on May 11 and May 12 it closed on the second touch point following the support from the last day and a half. Next stop is the breakout period, which also lines up in the middle of the time frame expected for the next price increase.

From there, call options can be exercised for the $5 strike point, which will drive the price higher. And there’s a ton of open interest.

I think I rest my case.

nbjqzf,,wallstreetbets,post,1620920949,"What's with the media's never-ending shill on CPI data? iNfLaTiOn Is +4.2% yOy, hIgHeSt SiNcE 2008. DUH. Yo2Y makes more sense as I demonstrate here.Note that I am not a fan of CPI. Inflation was already here a long time ago. So please spare me from using CPI. I am just sick of the media choosing to play easy journalism, in turn, putting so much pressure on ape stocks. BUT, this is a great buying op and here's why.

TLDR: CPI %Change number is COVID-biased. The actual number is not high. Inflation is already priced in.

Since yesterday all the channels have slammed ape stocks with the CPI data saying its YoY number was ATH since 2008. It's not fair to use YoY numbers because COVID messed up the trajectory of the CPI. The YoY 2019-2020 April number barely changed (from 255.548 to 256.389)[ https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/), which created stored energy that MUST be realized once the economy started recovering. The latest number of 267.054 is justified because it put the number back into the previous trajectory. In simple terms, the +4.2% seems huge because April 2020's number was frozen by COVID.

It's more appropriate to use Yo2Y number in this case (actually, in many other cases too as broader scope = more smoothened/accurate, less squared error). Think of it this way, without COVID, the number would not have been different than what we have now. The number should still be in the range of 264 - 268.

YoY, It's fair to say +4.16% is huge as it has not been this much since 2008 Sep.

[YoY](https://preview.redd.it/q1exbb7s2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6d0ff66f3c9da03fed8f0217ce8431eb057668)

However, if we smooth the data with a Yo2Y calculation, an increase of +4.5% over a period of **TWO** years is so common. The average number is +3.8% (this means +3.8% in **TWO** years).

[Yo2Y](https://preview.redd.it/ft5ukqtt2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17854220026ae80337519a3b9c356fa06a1cb3fd)

Please shut the fuck up about CPI. The use of CPI is retarded, but the way it's being brandished is even more retarded.

IMO, Inflation has already been priced in as, currently, KO has a higher P/E than AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BABA by more than 10%. These are not ape stocks, but my point stands as ""value"" stocks are overpriced than these tech stocks.

It's important that you know this because stupid journalism is making the price discovery process fucked. Investors flee to safe big cap stocks, making them overvalued. These big cap stocks then use these undeserved overvaluations to:

* afford massive ads budget so that it can shove stupid just-to-be-seen ads in your face. I don't want another Coke or Fanta ads to sell me the same message over and over for decades. It's an absolute waste of time and resource.
* lobby. Boy oh boy, where do I even start?
* take over other small companies.

The list goes on.

nayxtm,,wallstreetbets,post,1620852325,"UWMC and What's Happening: An Explanation of Rule 10BHello, so as you can imagine UWMC flew to the moon on a day where the market shit the bed. So, what happened? We're seeing the beginning of a huge squeeze in the very early stages. I'm just going to go through a factual explanation and some numbers.

On the earnings call yesterday, the CEO of UWMC (Matt Ishbia) stated that they would start the buyback starting tomorrow pending the rules.

What rules are there for stock buybacks? Well, the relevant one is Rule 10B, and they regulate stock buybacks. Why is this important?

Well, UWMC had an over 15% short interest, and that was recorded for April 30th. After RKT's earnings on the 5th, and LDI's on the 3rd of May, and looking at UWMC's share price tank after these two reported earnings... We can well imagine that the short interest increased since then.

Let's discuss what's going on then first shall we. Rule 10B is a safe harbor provision for stock manipulation in regards to buybacks, and if you follow them you're generally safe. One of these requirements is in regards to how many shares you're allowed to purchase on a given day. That number is 25% of the average daily volume. The average moving volume for UWMC right now is 5.64 Million, which means that UWMC could have bought up to 1.41 Million Shares worth of Stock.  Volume today was 8.91 Million. That means that there could have been up to an extra 3.27 Million Shares of additional volume? My guess is that it's a mix of hedge fund bulls who smell blood in the water, and momentum traders from WSB or more generally.

What does that all mean however? Well, usually there is volatility crush after Earnings, but UWMC remained highly volatile after earnings with a IV above 100%. That, combined with the massive amount of buys today means that the interest rates to borrow shares have mooned from 3-5% to 34.9% per annum. That's a huge increase. However, the shares available to short according to IBorrowdesk has actually gone down significantly. What that means is that the shorters are still in the game, so to speak.

Some of you are wondering what happened from 3:45PM onwards, and there's actually an explanation for that too, and it's rooted in Rule 10B.   Under Rule 10B companies with higher average trading volume or public float value can trade until the last 10 minutes. The shorters in the stock thus felt safe enough to borrow more shares to try to bring down the shares. If you see on IBorrowdesk the available shares went down from 2,000 to 800, before bouncing back to 3,000. So someone drove the stock down, then covered slightly or his position completely.

So, what's going to happen now? The short percentage is still sky high, and they haven't budged. Well, here's the thing. The public float is 110 Million, but of that there is a decent percentage that are institutional buyers. UWMC can buy up to 1.41 Million of that a day (which costs them only 9 million dollars a day!), and as the daily moving average moves up, they can start buying more and more. Those shares are retired, and thus cannot be bought back by shorters to cover. Furthermore, there are institutional buyers, and sophisticated traders who will want to get into the action (conceivably) because they see the way this is going. Finally, the ex dividend date is June 10th and if they refuse to cover their liable to have to pay the dividend to the owners of the shares. Finally, interest rate will continue to skyrocket upward pressuring them to cover or else get liquidated. At 2% a year, shorting UWMC even with its dividend was feasible, but to short UWMC with a 100+ interest rate is going to just destroy them. Especially when they additionally have to cover the shares they sold short.

In conclusion, the match has been lit (in my opinion), and the fuse will blow sooner or later. One one hand, UWMC retiring shares, and on the other hand, buyers driving up the price and then holding.

Edit: This also means that UWMC can squeeze the shorters with a buy back, while maintaining inclusion in the Russel by the way!",

You don't even know that the drop in availability was due to someone shorting.  It could just as easily be someone whose shares are available to be borrowed sold some shares (and the rise to 3000 could be that someone bought some; not necessarily someone covering).

Personally I have 33k shares and about 25k are lent out.  Fidelity pays me 60% of the borrow rate and today I was getting 2.5%; I'm hoping that it really has spiked to 40% (which would pay me 24% annualized)",

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what ""writing a put"" means?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long/Short Portfolio

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What is Long/Short? The premise of a long/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long/short combination is SPY/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To give an example of how I use the SPY/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This ""reaction"" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\* Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix.

\*Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50/50 vix spy split will not be profitable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are many ways to set up a long/short portfolio. SPY/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long/short backbone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would

argue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares.

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long/short, use SPY/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first.  This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with. So here's my advice, take it or leave it

I read through the DD and understand why the OP had their post pulled down. That being said, the content is solid and I think its worth repeating. I have edited the below DD to remove the parts that were maybe a little too over-eager.

$UWMC ULTIMATE DD

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! 🚀 (No that’s not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That’s big money ! But let’s dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says “We can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !”

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it’s higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn’t park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR 🏘=💵💵💵💵 = UWMC 🚀🚀🚀🤑  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??

nblwj8,,wallstreetbets,post,1620926315,"Redfin (RDFN) Severely Undervalued with Great CatalystsHello Fellow Autists,

The residential real estate market is booming. REITS are too boomer for you, so you look for growth plays to play real estate. Redfin (RDFN) is a play that is greatly undervalued.  

**What is Redfin?** Redfin is a residential real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one’s real estate needs. **Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**  

This company does it all, they will buy your house, sell your house, you can buy a house on it, get approved for a mortgage, get a mortgage, or even hire a concierge service to get your home ready for people to view it in person or online. Your wife's boyfriend can take care of all his real estate needs and finally get you a house to you don't have to ask him if you can turn on the AC at night. Think of this company as a potential amazon of real estate and nobody does what they do.

https://preview.redd.it/dh2x14z91xy61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d864509782271001b5de5c5d29c7eaf3dd814c

In the past few years Redfin has had crazy growth, in 2019 alone they had over 60% revenue growth and during the quarter of COVID lockdowns they sustained over 4% growth compared to that quarter last year which is crazy because everybody was under lockdown. 

&#x200B;

Recently the company lost over 30% of its share value after earnings per share miss (They beat revenue estimates) and the Nasdaq brutality that has happened lately. They are currently trading at around 49-50 dollars a share as I write this, which is about a 5 billion dollar market cap. They are projected to have well over 5 billion dollars in revenue alone and be profitable in 2025. They will be profitable by end of 2021. This is a company that recently in 2016 only had about .33% of all the homes sold in North America, and now they have over 1% and growth will be exponential as they acquire more listing through their catalysts. I did a DCF analysis and the perpetuity approach price value of the stock using slightly bullish over consensus numbers was around 95$ per share. With sensitivity analysis the best case is around 150$ per share.  

**The investment thesis:** Redfin will trade higher through the catalysts of **surging real estate prices** due to people moving out of cities due to Covid, inflation, interest rates, and the general economy booming right now, the **acquisition of Rentpath**, and the **expansion of RedfinNow program**. Plus the company right now is way undervalued and is a steal. 

Real Estate Industry Outlook: 

 In 2020, Redfin accounted for 1.00% of total home sales, leaving much more room for redfin to acquire market share 

• 8% estimate rise in real estate sales in 2021, which will benefit Redfin’s business

• As home prices rise, the profits for Redfin rise as well

• During 2020, revenue in the real estate market hit $33.6 trillion

• Over the last 10 years, mortgage rates have declined by \~2.42%, benefiting residential real estate

Essentially real estate is booming, and Redfin was already in hyper growth mode before COVID. 

&#x200B;

**Expansion of RedfinNow**

This is a newer program and they are committed to growing it recently adding San Francisco to territory this program exists. RedfinNow is a great way to liquidate your home with a cash offer from Redfin. You get a no-obligation offer in a few days. Close on your schedule, and move when you're ready. This is helping them get more listings because in this industry more listings makes you get more views and Redfin is already the most visited online brokerage by a lot. This will add to their exponential growth of their business and as long as they buy the houses for dirt cheap they will also churn out good profit on them. This is their number one growing segment of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Acquisition of Rentpath** 

In February, Redfin moved into the rental industry, acquiring RentPath for $608 Million.

\-RentPath has more than 20,000 apartment buildings on its rental websites, and grew its traffic more than 25% last year

\-One in five  of Redfin’s 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent

\-Redfin plans to have all of Rentpath’s listing on their own website by 2022, the partnership will allow for: 

\- Better Search Experience

\- Better Value for Advertisers

\-Higher Traffic Growth

\-And open up to a younger customer base as many younger people want to see rentals because they are not in a position to buy a house whether it be because of finances, job, etc. 

&#x200B;

**Summarization:** Redfin is extremely undervalued where it is at right now and is a steal. The company has no competitor that does what they do. Zillow only makes its money from advertising while Redfin has all sorts of revenue segments that are diverse. The real estate market outlook that has been brought on by Covid took this already crazy growth company pulled it back a little in a slingshot and let it rip. Throw in RedfinNow and Rentpath and this company is going to be a terror for other companies to deal with. This is a great long term play and longer dated call options are going to be great. At the end of the day redfin is a company for the consumer and saves them lots of money while they make money. you can save up to 40k selling a million dollar house on their website. That's a lot of money to use on some  FD's.

NRG Energy ($NRG) – A utility with millions of customers and a stupid cheap price to forward P/E of 5.82 and an even juicier price to free-cash-flow of 5.63. They also pay a 1.30 annual dividend which works out to 3.87%. In addition, every year since 2017 they have reduced their share count with buybacks,

NRG Energy is a very profitably utility that faced headwinds following their acquisition of Direct Energy which was involved in the winter storm that locked up a lot of Texas’s green energy sector. (Impact of it was $550 million.) This is minor in the scale of NRG’s revenue and their annual free-cash-flow.

Recent distribution of the stock has hit a point where I think the selling pressure is off. It has spent the last two weeks in a down-trend to based at support right around $33.35 This is a zone which held strong at several points this year.

Selling volume hit a relative high yesterday and if today’s volume comes in way light that will confirm an oversold condition and very likely start a counter-trend. (Moving back up.)

The company still has a very large buyback pool. According to [Y-charts](https://ycharts.com/companies/NRG/stock_buyback) they started buying back shares again in the quarter ended in March. ($8 million worth.) If they hit the same numbers as 2020 they should buyback about $250 million before the end of the year.

The stock is trading in a sweet spot $4 below it’s 200-day moving average. As you can see from this 1-year weekly chart below. Even in March of 2020, the pandemic crash, it only stayed below the 200 for 8-weeks. In all other cases it was a 5-week or less time period. The current time below 200 is 4-weeks. (The green line is the 200 day moving average.)

For these reasons I believe the stock is a good short-term long with prices that should reach above $38. In the long term I think the stock will trade around $45. (28% + 3.87% dividend). Opportunity is 32% for a year.",['NRG']

But why is it that for a company like GM, where the inflation would in theory equal more revenue on every car sale, be a benefit, but for a company like Snapchat, where revenue on ads should increase with inflation, they are getting hammered? I feel like inflation as a whole should be a concern but how it seems to be pricing itself doesn’t make sense.

nazngd,,wallstreetbets,post,1620854177,"The Tamp Down team, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Plunge Protection Team has London operations. The LBMA pulls off the greatest spoof in the history of trading - 124 million oz of silver to spook the May contract longs. JP Morgan's criminal enterprise spoofing operation is child's play.

Five times each year Comex futures enters a period of drama as the large contracts (January, May, July, September and December) approach first notice day. It is a display of the paper charade that Comex silver and gold markets are. With only a few weeks to first notice day there are 5 or 6 times as many contracts open as the entire metal available for delivery as registered stocks. And just because it is in the vault doesn’t mean the shorts hold title to the bars, so the key ratio is likely far higher than 5 or 6.

The drama plays out over 3 weeks as many traders either roll their position to a forward month or close their position. Only a fraction stand for delivery. With only a week to go, there are still typically about 3 times as many open contracts as metal in the vault.

This must be a stressful situation for those short silver or whose goal is to “tamp down” precious metals markets. The metals “Tamp Down Team"" is a fully owned subsidiary of the “Plunge Protection Team”.

Let’s digress to routine day to day trading in the futures market. JP Morgan was found by the CFTC to be a criminal enterprise from their spoofing operation. From Reuters:

“Between 2008 and 2016, JPMorgan engaged in a pattern of manipulation in the precious metals futures and U.S. Treasury futures market, the CFTC said. Traders would place orders on one side of the market which they never intended to execute, to create a false impression of buy or sell interest that would raise or depress prices, according to the settlement.”

[https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325)

JP Morgan was fined by the CFTC for nearly $1 billion for spoofing the market … creating the illusion of supply or demand to manipulate the market.

The LBMA spoofed on the grandest scale in history. They created the illusion of an instant appearance of 124 million oz of silver, in essence a sell order.

First, the LBMA changed their reporting schedule. Normally they report stocks on a one month lag however on March 5, the LBMA changed the lag to just 5 business days. This enabled them to publish new vault numbers BEFORE the roll period of the May contract. If the 30 day lag was used, the published stocks report would be after first notice day of the May contract and would not impact investor psychology or actions.

The subsequent announcement of the stocks report occurred on April 9 just as the roll from the May contract started.  The LBMA titled its press release as “Record stocks of Silver in London Vaults” to make the biggest splash possible.

If you held a May silver futures contract long position and thought the silver market was getting tight, would it be unnerving to see 124 million oz suddenly appear in the LBMA vault as “record stocks”? An investor could easily think that if 124 million oz can be added in this month, then maybe more could be added next month.

Note the timing of the LBMA reporting change annoucement and the initial ""record stocks"" press release superimposed on the May contract timeline shown below. The ""record stocks"" report occurred immediately before the critical weeks before first notice date.



Then on May 10, the LBMA issued a statement that effectively retracted nearly all of the “record stocks”. They stated the revised stock levels although they didn't use the word ""revised"".  And it only admitted its “error” in a footnote:

\*A data submission error led to the publication of an incorrect aggregate figure for the total silver held in London vaults in March. The corrected figure is 1,143,194 Troy ounces ('000s).

[https://www.lbma.org.uk/articles/london-gold-and-silver-vault-holdings-end-april-2021](https://www.lbma.org.uk/articles/london-gold-and-silver-vault-holdings-end-april-2021)

And just like that, the spoof was cancelled!

The metals markets manipulation has now gone to a new level. There are many indications that the metals market charade is under duress. I think this may be the sharpest signal yet.

If you haven't heard of the ""Tamp Down Team"", it was recently revealed by the Mr. Rostin Brehnam, acting Chairman of the CFTC:

the only thing why this will be an even better bear play is that momentum starts working against her. It happened with Warren Buffett and he caught it after a string of occurrences when he buys a position people instantly sell. His name becomes toxic and people recognize the trend.

Your call is right. The reasoning is wrong.

Cathy is fine in what she is doing. She picked a lane and is staying in that lane. Her fund is for investors that want to speculate in tech. For her to shift her focus to non innovation names would be false advertising and give a disservice to her investors.

It is her investors who should be selling out as the market is adjusting. Between the rotation trade and interest rates rising, these stocks are going to be hard to continue to speculate.

I was never a big fan of the Ark funds, but I respect her for being consistent. I don't agree with all of her ideas, but I wouldn't say she is dumb.

nawd69,,wallstreetbets,post,1620845695,"Why is $UWMC the Best Meme Stock Today?I wrote a DD on $UWMC pre-earnings. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xrrg/is_the_market_right_about_uwmc/)). It was obviously too long for people who can't read.

All other meme's stocks are trash today and $UWMC is the only breakout winner. Today's market movements show what UWMC investors already knew: Mat Ishbia is pissed Wall Street doesn't like his company.

See, Mat Ishbia has been in the trenches building UWM from 15 employees to 8,000+ for about 20 years. He did it profitably without outside financing. He sold 7% of his company to take it public at $10/share and Wall Street has been crapping on it ever since.

Remember when you were a kid and took hours drawing that nice picture for your dad and he looked at it for .5 seconds and said, ""You're shit at drawing."" and then went back to drinking his coffee and reading the paper? Yeah, that drawing is $UWMC except the kid is Mat and he is a billionaire.

Here is what is special and unique about $UWMC. The 100m+ shares of the float represent a small fraction of shares. So Mat's personal wealth is affected greatly by little Kenny on Wall Street trying to make a few bucks shorting it. Ken has millions on the line, Mat has billions. And if you don't know this about Mat, dudes a bonafide winner.

He is taking on Rocket Mortgage and plans to be the largest originator in America in five years. He keeps saying he is growing and Wall Street isn't listening. Now... he has a $300 million share buyback war chest, 5%+ dividend, and a tiny float. He just needs a match but the board gave him a flamethrower.

In the conference call he said, ""At these prices, I'm a buyer."" and seemed genuinely giddy to buy tomorrow.

So this price action is just the start of the share buybacks. I'm in it til $16/share.

napgpn,,wallstreetbets,post,1620828291,"The market is giving us an absolute gift with these inflation numbers, it’s time to load up the truck, PSLVWe’ve got a massive overshoot on inflation, coming in at 0.8% month over month versus 0.2% expected.

Annualized that’s a 10% inflation rate.

Year over year core CPI came in at 3%. The last time we had a yearly core CPI at 3% was 1996 and the fed funds rate was 5%, not 0%.  The last time we had monthly core CPI advancing this quickly was 1980.

So what is the reaction among gold and silver, the traditional inflation hedge plays? They are selling off and the dollar is rallying.

Why? The market is now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike, despite the insistence of the fed that there won’t be one.

Once they digest that rate hikes won’t happen, this is the next black swan.

Will JPow spit in the face of a market that is fully pricing in a rate hike?  Usually the fed likes to go along with market expectations rather than shock the system.

I believe they won’t raise rates or signal that rate hikes are coming soon.

We still require massive fed and fiscal support to keep the economy and market from crashing, and they will choose the economy over keeping inflation in check.

What happens to the dollar when a 100% priced in expectation doesn’t happen?  Eventually the market is going to realize rates are staying at 0% regardless of inflation.

When this sets in, gold and silver are going to uncharted heights.

Silver is essentially levered gold. Look at my profile and find the stickied SLV post, read past the part bashing SLV and you’ll see silver is the investment to dump 20% of your big boy money into to save yourself this decade.

In most decades equities will massively outperform metals. Every few decades the opposite occurs. In the last two silver bull markets silver outperformed equities by 40x and 25x respectively during their 10 year run ups.

Look at the 50-year cup and handle forming on silver, and tell me it’s not a screaming buy:

Load up the truck, mortgage the house, buy PSLV

Alternatives: buy physical silver if you don’t care about liquidity (keep premiums below 20%), buy silver miners for even more leverage, buy options on miners for even more leverage. Just don’t touch the scam that is SLV.

Play it how you like, but please, if you have some ‘set it and forget’ type of money, put 20% into gold or silver through the 2020s. You can sell it at the end of the decade if you want to.  This sub has a habit of pure momentum trading, if someone suggests a ticker, every ape looks it up and if it’s already massively green they jump on the train. This is an opportunity to jump on a train before it’s running.

There is very little free floating silver in 1000oz bar form, and the [LBMA just spoofed 10% of it out of existence ](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/lbma-misleads-silver-market-with-false-claims-about-record-silver-stocks/). Look at lumber, rhodium, palladium. That’s what happens when supply runs out and shorts are forced to continuously cover in a commodities market.  This can easily happen in silver.

If you read that article you'll realize that when WSB piled into SLV in early Feb, that actually did nothing because SLV didn't go out buy the silver.  They sold us paper lies and then their authorized participants shorted futures.  We have since learned that SLV is a scam and are buying PSLV and physical.  No more wool over the sheep's eyes.  We are coming for the metal, and taking the little silver that there is.  Banks who are massively net short can come begging later this decade at $500 an oz

This spooked the market and led to a sell-off in both the bonds and stock market. 

Is this the inflation monster which the market fears but has not seen for years about to rear its head or this is, as the Federal Reserve will have us believe, all just transitory and nothing to write home about?

With this upside surprise in inflation, it is key to monitor what the Fed officials will say about this in the days ahead. Their message has been adamantly consistent that inflation prints will be higher due to base effects and supply constraints. They have been telling us that these high prints will be transitory and fall off as time passes and when the global supply chains are fully restored. 

For now, it’s just one data point, and on the heels of a disappointingly weak jobs number last week, it is likely that they will stay the course and stick to their message. Stay focused and don’t get swayed by the fear-mongers.",

A growing deflationary hurricane is churning off the coast. At the same time, a massive inflationary warm front is surging toward us, threatening inflation like we have not seen in forty years.  As if forecasting future economic conditions was not tricky enough, both systems are being fueled in unknown ways by the convergence of historical amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus.

The two ominous and encroaching weather systems make economic and market forecasting extremely difficult. The most recent evidence came from last week’s BLS employment report. The consensus of economic forecasters missed the mark by 734,000 jobs. That is over three times the average monthly job growth pre-pandemic.

To add insult to injury, consider forecasters must also untangle global supply line problems and resulting shortages of many commodities and finished goods. Further, robust pent-up demand from the lifting of economic restrictions and a global pandemic significantly influences the economic climate.

Despite such extraordinary circumstances, the level of confidence in economic and market forecasts is remarkably high. Many “experts” forecast beautiful days with a temporary bout of above-average inflation. There is nary a mention of the potential for debilitating inflation and almost no recognition of the troubling deflationary hurricane off at sea.

**The confidence and hubris backing forecasts should be of great concern, not comfort.**

 Misplaced Confidence

How a simple flap of a butterfly wing can change the environment attests to the difficulty in predicting the weather. Meteorologists are quick to describe their limitations and relatively poor level of confidence around longer-range forecasts. They understand the impossibility of calculating millions of variable factors affecting the weather.

During more typical economic and market conditions, prognosticators struggle with forecasts. For example, the first graph below shows how the Fed consistently overestimated economic growth coming out of the last recession.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e9s0bola2sy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a51fd6005d773753fe0bef70b845d31f93902e1e

 The following graph, courtesy of Deutsche Bank, highlights how Wall Street economists have consistently erred in their expectations for higher interest rates over the last fifteen years.

&#x200B;

[ As the title of the next graph tells, investors have a long history of poor Fed Funds forecasts. ](https://preview.redd.it/r842x12e2sy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7798a2068bfb765db5950e252d7af2013fdc2c71)

Today, those at the Fed offer investors a good amount of confidence in predicting the pace of the economic recovery. They appear highly confident that any spurt of inflation will be transitory. If wrong, they offer complete confidence in their unproven tools to halt inflation. We know from historical experience that when the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it is very difficult to arrest.

Wall Street analysts shrug off record equity and bond market valuations with forecasts of growth and normality.  Investors buying in at such valuations must have total trust that the Fed and Wall Street are correct. Despite the evidence that professional economic prognosticators are not very good at their jobs, everyone seems assured of the future.

The graphs below show money supply growth, and the fiscal deficit are at levels that are anything but ordinary. Are we to believe the effects and consequences of such extreme monetary and fiscal policy, occurring concurrently, are easy to predict? **What kind of professional would fail to recognize the peril of such a claim?**

*Bulls win in Bull Markets; Bears win in Bear Markets. Eagles soar above and take advantage of opportunity. Let us help you soar as you reach your financial goals I am bull for silver .But no advice for stocks , currency or other financial assets as  Neither Bull nor Bear.*

Quite often, investors are rewarded for going against the crowd, especially when the masses are in agreement on what the future holds.

 The reality is like meteorologists predicting next week’s weather; no one knows what the economy holds in store. Of course, they can extrapolate current trends and make educated guesses on how consumers and corporations react to future events. Still, no one has ever experienced anything like what we face today.

Small sample sizes affects the statistics greatly especially if 1 or 2 people falls outside 2-3 standard deviations. The Nature Medicine article which was posted on the 10th of May involved treating severe PTSD with MDMA (ecstasy). In this experiment the results were significant!

I am a medical student in my psychiatry clerkship and I've discussed this with all of my attendings and the residents. This is the future of psychiatry and mental health. Mindmed is currently looking at other areas where psychedelics could beneficial. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, chronic pain, ADHD, substance abuse, etc. This is just the beginning of areas where psychedelics can be applied. Further chemical manipulation can produce more therapeutic drugs.

For those who are not pharmacologists or chemists all psychedelics have a serotonergic backbone. Meaning that they are all similar to serotonin. Serotonin is our feel good neurotransmitter and is the clinical target for depression. The current medication regimen for depression is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Their mechanism of action is to increase serotonin by blocking reuptake in our synapses. ALL PSYCHEDELICS ARE SEROTONIN ANALOGS! This is good! Depression and anxiety have not had any new breakthroughs since the 1980s, sertraline and fluoxetine (Prozac and Zoloft). With more and more people being diagnosed with depression and anxiety it is a 4.7 BILLION dollar market. Imagine getting into this breakthrough at $3.00 a share. The potential of this field of research and the current market is astronomical. This treatment will be the future of psychiatry and mental health. When including other areas like substance abuse and chronic pain you are looking at an even bigger market. These shares in a few years could be at $200 dollars a share.

I am not a financial expert or a stock broker. I am a medical student who is working in this field. I am not associated with any company and I have no conflicts of interest. I am just stating research that is being produced at an increasing rate.",

So far I think, Intel and $TSM seem to be the best options. TSM is one of the top semiconductor stocks. Intel is well, Intel. Been around and will be around for awhile.

Ericsson to pay $97 Million to Nokia for after settling damages claim

Telecoms gear maker Ericsson [(ERICb.ST)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ERICb.ST) has reached an agreement with Finland's Nokia to pay a damages claim of 80 million euros ($97 million), it said on Wednesday.

Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. It settled with the DoJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.

The DoJ had [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU) that Ericsson admitted to conspiring with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify books and records and by failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.

Ericsson said on Wednesday the settlement would impact operating profit (EBIT) by 80 million euros and cashflow by 26 million euros in the second quarter.

""The amount reflects uncertainty, risk, expense, and potential distraction from business focus associated with a potentially lengthy and complex litigation,"" it said in a statement.

The Swedish company added that the remainder of the settlement amount would be made in similar instalments in 2022 and 2023, impacting cash flow.

""Nokia can confirm that the information in Ericsson's press release is accurate. We have no further comment,"" a spokeswoman said.

Ericsson did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.",

Think about all the stuff you buy regularly, food up 10-20%, gas up from $2.10 - $3.10, that's 50%, lumber for housing, double last year, oil up, and going higher due to the ransomware hack last weekend.  That may be a 1-time event for that co. but it's happening weekly to different oil & gas cos. but didn't have as much effect on consumers so not widely known.  Even if inflation isn't 9.6% it is well over 5% and the Fed, still says they're not convinced inflation is a problem.  The last time the Fed poured money into the system expecting something that did NOT happen was 2000 (remember Y2K) and rather than use that $$ for an ""emergency"" it was invested and the market flew (Tech bubble) but when the Fed realized and it was too late the market crashed as the Fed took that money back, well this time it's MBS (mortgage backed securities) the Fed is buying $80b a month which keeps mtg rates artificially low, but when they take the money out of the system, just watch the freefall",

If that’s the case, then the spike in prices will simply be the new baseline that the target 2% inflation rate will build off going forward. This scenario, which is the most likely one in my opinion, would keep the fed on hold based on their commentary around it be transitory. Of course this means these higher prices are here to stay, but the rate of growth can and will likely subside considerably.",

With basic regime detection (using HMMs on some stock & some options data) & quarterly portfolio optimization the strategy would have yielded 40% CARG (using up to 2x leverage when warranted) with a Sortino: 2.5 / Sharpe: 1.7 from 2012 to Q1 2021.....Not too shabby....

The two pictures show quarterly allocations and equity curve over time.

**The strategy never went completely out of the market in ANY period before March-2021**. I literally just finished working on this study earlier this week and am almost fully invested with discretionary stuff. 

The ""hopeful"" part of me is hoping for a bounce so that my AMD, NFLX, NOW, PLTR, V etc. pair back the losses but now looking at this I might have to put on my “thinking hat” because this time the payers might now get answered this time around, or the bounce might be short lived.

By non traditional metrics, money has poured into the markets causing metrics to rise. You gotta just deal with that.

Inflation going up is going to annihilate some companies 3-5 years. Netflix being one of them. If rates start spiking, SaaS models are going to get obliterated if you are over levered.

You can’t charge $60 a month to watch stranger things because commercial lenders are now lending at 5% a clip. Every .25% compresses Netflix’s bottom line by millions.

So you get more sellers than buyers until things get figured out. It’s what’s supposed to happen. Other companies can pass on inflation to the customer. I still need microchips and food. I don’t give a flying fuck about Netflix, but Shot Caller is a 10/10 movie.",['NFLX']

* Broke through the 410 put wall and tested near the gap fill top line before bouncing to close. 
* 20 SMMA failed.
* **Note midterm support range  that could come into play if SPY breaks 400 in the near to midterm \[393, 387, 380, 378\]. This is where SPY could test the 60 SMMA.** 
* **Bears need to still break 400. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bounce tomorrow but Bulls need to reclaim 410-412 support for a recovery. Look for resistance @ 410.**

Note:

* Steady downtrend failed and bears broke the 244.7m possibility.
* OBV fell below a major level @ 237.1m.
* **Could see more selling pressure in the AM and a bounce @ 233.83m line. But will it be a ""dead cat"" as pointed out from first week of March or a rally?**
* **We could see downwards pressure to 218.8m line in Friday or early next week if indeed a dead cat bounce.**

* **Bears need to keep downward pressure towards the area of interests where a small gap could be filled \[306, 303, 301, 298\]**
* **Be care full with a bear trap slip past the 60 SMMA support as highlighted in March. We could see some slippage and recovery. Keep an eye out.**
