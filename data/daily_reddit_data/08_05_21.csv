Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

n7mz6p,,stocks,post,1620472158,"LMND - an over valued insurance stock pretending to be a tech stock?I got caught up in LMND during the January hype and I now I'm a bag holder. It's made me look at LMND in more detail and really dissect their financials. Below is a short DD on LMND looking at their 10K annual report in preparation for their Q1 report coming out on Monday.

https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001691421/7d400e55-689a-4fc1-9a55-28ce9601dc6e.pdf

To begin, LMND is an insurance provider that is looking to disrupt the insurance marketplace using AI to handle claims and drive high customer support.

LMND is currently trading at MktCap of 5B with a P/S multiple of 52. Compared to other incumbents in the pure insurance industry:

ALL: P/S - 0.89, MC - 40B

PGR: P/S - 1.39, MC - 62B

TRV: P/S - 1.26, MC - 40B

So obviously LMND is trading at a multiple that treats it more like a tech company than an insurance company. But lots of companies want to be valued at a multiple of a tech company vs insurance company, so lets dig deeper.

LMND made 94BM in revenue in 2020 with a YoY growth of 40%. In their earnings call in March, they stated that they expect greater growth slowdown in 2021...so there's definitely reason to be cautious here given that their mkt cap multiplier is totally based on growth projections.

Here's the troubling part of LMND. Even though their revenue is growing aggressively, their net losses are stacking up too. In 2019 they had net loss of 108M on 67M of revenue, and in 2020 they had net loss of 120M in 94M of revenue. So though their net losses aren't growing at the same rate as their revenue, they're definitely not closing the gap at a great rate. The biggest contribution to their net losses is G&A and technology development. G&A can't be helped as I assume they went on a hiring blitz in 2020. But their investment in ""technology development"" increased 98% from 9.8B to 19.4B. 

While G&A is straight forward as employee compensation, Technology Development is listed as follows:

Technology development - Technology development consists of employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and benefits, and expenses related to vendors engaged in product management, design, development and testing of the Company's websites and products. Technology development also includes allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount.

Pretty abstract stuff...

Okay, so lets make some projections. The simplest projections is that we're seeing a big shift in the tech market place as a bear market has taken hold the past 3 months. May doesn't look any better, but many of these high flying ""tech stocks"" are now seeing a reduction in multiple. Even if LMND could grow their revenue by 200% this year, if the market starts valuing them like an insurance company and not a tech company (a la RKT), we'll see LMND's price tank into the mid 20's and maybe even lower.

The second projection is if we look at growth of revenue. In their Q4, Lemonade said they are seeing slowdown in a key growth metric:

https://news.futunn.com/en/post/8971338?level=1&data_ticket=1620471675650956

The stock tanked to $113 from $132, and has been on a slide since then, influenced by general tech stock malaise. Even at its current price of $79 it seems over valued in some regards.

Here are the key metrics to look for. LMND is projecting revenue in Q1 to be 22M. That would set it on base to make about $100M in CY2021. Which isn't spectacular growth to justify its valuation, as it slows the growth rate down to 10% YoY.

Overall, LMND stock looks really dicey at the moment. Given this information, I'm probably going to unload half my bags before earnings and see what the news is. If the news is good, then I'll hold the other half and hope to reduce my losses. Otherwise, I plan to immediately unload the remaining half if the growth numbers look bad since this will ensure another 3 month slide in price. If growth numbers are bad, expect LMND to fall below their IPO price.

LMND did an offering at $165/share in January. I feel real bad for anyone who has their cost average that high, because looking at their financial statements and projections, LMND doesn't look like they'll get back up there in 2021.



Last note, I think LMND is aiming for an AI holy grail to do their real disruption. They're hoping that if they can handle all claims using AI (of which, currently AI Jim, their claims AI, handles 95% of all claims), they may be able to drive down their costs of doing business so aggressively that their margins become industry leading. Company's like ALL, TRV and PGR have demonstrated that they are too large and bureaucratic to offer solutions like this. So right now, this is the only saving grace of LMND imho.

n7chm7,,stocks,post,1620431535,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returnsRecent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?",['ARKK']

While going through her paperwork, he came across some old stock certificates from Arden Farms dated 1957.  I know it was a big dairy company in the 50s and 60s.  I did a quick Google search for him and couldn't find anything, so I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone knew if they had any value or if there were free resources for us to look into it.

n7ngj5,,stocks,post,1620474099,"Rebalancing? Long-term strategyHi all,

I hope I will get some critical feedback on my question on rebalancing:

I don´t wanna write an essay here so I will try to make this quick:

1) I am a super long-term investor 

2) I have around 95% of my money in stocks/crypto

3) I automatically put a lot of money in stocks every month and will continue to do so. Most of the money goes into Tesla, Nasdaq100 and additionally into the individual big tech firms, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook & Co and some broader, more global ETFs 

Right now I have quite a lot of money (also from one-time investments) in Nasdaq100 and individual stocks like Apple, Amazon & Co. I pretty much see them as my cash equivalent, but I also see them getting bigger and bigger. That´s why I invest into them on a monthly basis.

However, since right now in the current market, high growth potential stocks are getting hammered I see a lot of potential in investing into them, since I see a lot more potential, since fundamentally I think almost nothing has changed but only becuase of markoeconomical reasons, they are getting slaughtered.

Since I don´t have any cash, my idea was to rebalance a little bit.

E.g. Sell Amazon/Apple and buy Teladoc 

I don´t want to argue about Teladoc here, it´s just an example.

In my opinion, Teladoc has a very bright future, it has really good fundamentals, high growth curve and will (again in my opinion) exponentially grow in the next years/decades.

Since e.g. Teladoc is down by 50% from ATH, what do you think about that?

I know, that evaluations in generall with these high growth companies were pretty high (also because of all the FED money pumped into the markets), but a decrease by 50% in that short of a time just seems crazy to me, especially because I think its only happening because of the overall market and not because of fundamentals of that individual company.","['AAPL', 'FB', 'NDAQ', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']"

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”

EDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.

The below 11 holdings (of 43) constitute 52% of my portfolio. They are my current main plays, and I do detailed DD at 4% or if I see myself increasing my holding to 4%, and are long term hold.

&#x200B;

Feedback / questions / comments welcome. Happy to go into more detail, but for now have just done a very brief rationale for my positions:

&#x200B;

**£ Hollywood Bowl:** 8.35%. Love this company, branding, numbers (pre-Covid), great management, solid track record and steady growth (also pre-Covid).

**$ Microsoft:** 6.00%. It's just a great company doing well. Diverse, growing, and hungry. It's a growth and divi growth play.

**$ BMY:** 5.36%. Obviously disappointing results, but the treatments they have I believe will recover, plus solid looking pipeline at fairly advanced stages.

**$ AT&T:** 4.67%. I'm bullish and like what I see, from wireless to HBO. I work in backend telco systems and I delved into the Jan QTR end figures for their wireless division and loved what I saw, so increased my holding materially before the latest very impressive results.

**$ EPD:** 4.56%. Defensive and divi, feels undervalued, I like that it has a significant pipeline network built, port and storage infrastructure, significant LNG exposure, and had pretty robust results consider 2020 (commodity prices, Texan weather and Covid dampening demand.

**£ Games Workshop:** 4.52%. Crazy margins, great CEO / management, expansion possibilities, lore on point. It's up 23x over 5 years with divi reinvested, 18x without, it's a beast that'll be in the FTSE100 end of 2023, likely sooner.

**£ Sage Group:** 4.23%. Bit un-noticed but does HR / payroll / finance and is geographically well diversified and under loved. Legacy tech but I like it, divi and buybacks. I generally feel CRM systems (Salesforce most notable) get all the attention because obviously they're meant to drive sales, but other internal systems matter and are in desperate need of modernisation. (If you want a sexier but higher risk play if you accept this logic, consider Workday).

**£ Fevertree Drinks:** 3.8%. Convinced this company will be a monster, and maybe the next Monster. Originally a tonic specialist for Gin, it's targeting both international and other mixers for expansion. Market hugely over-reacted to decent results considering Covid, and I opened a sizeable position.

**$ CACI International:** 3.77%. Also a bit unnoticed, it's a software meets military intelligence and Gov IT company. No divi, and they are quite clear they have no intention of it (literally a Buffett approach, we can use the money better than you.. :)), but winning contracts and very deeply ingrained with US Gov / military.

**$ HBAN**: 3.76%. Regional US bank digesting an acquisition. I like the direction. Recent numbers were so-so and dipped to $14.50, which is was a chance for me to add 80% to my previous holding.

**$ HUN:** 3.2%. Funny story here, I found this by accident when HBAN dipped to $14.50 as was looking for data to understand that drop and put in ""Hunt"" for Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and accidently went to Huntsman Corporation (HUN). Lucky for me I guess, as I was curious and liked what I saw. I was frantically buying under $28, and although the shares shot up following good results and a 15% divi increase, I still like it. I see nobody talking about them,  but they have made significant changes to their business over the last couple of years, so although revenue is falling, earnings are looking great. It's become a leaner business with a war chest for suitable acquisitions, seems undervalued and has a respectable and now fast growing divi.","['BMY', 'MSFT', 'HBAN', 'CRM']"

You know this company, massive name recognition

Revenues from $59B to $77B in past 5 years

Profit DOUBLED from $10B to $20B in past 5 years

Shares outstanding decreasing!

Current assets cover current liabilities

They have taken on more debt in past year which, with low rates, may be spur the next phase of their growth

Their industry is not going away and in very high demand

Free Cash flow has gone from $12B to $21B



Negatives:

Once a dominant player, they've slipped recently and lost their lead to competition. 

Seen as an older player, less advanced and ground breaking

Management shake up of recent


So where does that lead the stock?  

UNDERVALUED!

P/FCF is 11


WILD CARD:

The new CEO has a history with the company, but left for other leadership positions in the past few years.  Now he is back to LEAD and has a PLAN to bring the company back.

Ok, why should I believe him?

You won't get this from other Deep Dives...

The CEO grew up Amish and is very religious.  He started a organization to convert 1 Million people in silicon valley to the way of Jesus.  He has a calling in life!  He can not be seen as a loser!  His credibility is on the line!  If he brings this company back to the top, it will also bring his passion for Jesus to the front as well!

Will anyone here with better understandings give me few examples of undervalued stocks? I don’t think most meme stocks ppl mention are undervalued rather they are way overvalued. Please help me understand,['PPL']
n7j2lr,gxd6xby,stocks,comment,1620459260,"I mean, this is probably of no use because it's obvious, but when someone says a stock is undervalued, it means **they think** that the market price of a company is lower than the company is really worth. If someone says they think Apple is undervalued, it is tantamount to saying that Apple is actually worth more than the $2.17 trillion that the market says its worth (for the record, **I** think such a claim would be patently ridiculous). 

It's up to you to figure out how you determine a company's value. A long time ago people relied on tangible assets and cash equivalents against debts to form the base value of a company (sort of like book value), the idea being that the company is worth at least what its owners would get if they decided to close shop and liquidate everything. But this isn't really a great way to value most companies, at least because no company exists with the intention to close shop and liquidate its assets---it would presumably only do so to end an unprofitable enterprise or by force of insolvency. 

The hot-button issue in valuation is obviously how much a company has earned in the past and, especially, **how much you think it will earn in the future**---this is where the most divergence of opinion on value happens, and unfortunately it's also the point where we're the least confident (or, at least, we should be). If a company earns $1 million this year, the market says it's worth $10 million, and you're confident it will earn $100 million a year in 5 years, then you might say that the market is severely undervaluing the company because it's not thinking about the company's potential appropriately. But this is down to what **you** think, and the result comes down to whether or not you were right.

**What is QQQ?**

Invesco QQQ is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Index includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq based on market cap.

QQQ is the most direct way to “invest” into the Nasdaq-100 index as it tracks it and is passively managed. It is heavily based on technology. This seems like it can be a con as it is “less diverse” or a pro if you are bullish in tech.

**Top 10 Allocation: (**[**https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html**](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html)**)**

**AAPL: 10.95%**

**MSFT: 9.50%**

**AMZN: 8.32%**

**TSLA: 4.24%**

**FB: 3.78%**

**GOOG: 3.62%**

**GOOGL: 3.31%**

**NVDA: 2.69%**

**PYPL: 2.31%**

**INTC: 2.11%**

**48.11% of total stocks are in the information technology sector.**

[https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html)

It consistently outperforms it’s common comparison being the S&P 500 Index.

A 10,000 dollar investment in QQQ on March 31st 2011 would become 61,493 dollars today, compared to 36,756 dollars from the S&P 500 index.

QQQ is considered a riskier ETF than the S&P because of how technology based it is, meaning more of a capital gains ETF where S&P involves more mature companies.

Many people worry about a crash similar to the dot come crash where it took several years for QQQ to recover. If a crash like this happened, is that not a market wide thing? I don’t see why QQQ would be affected any worse than other stocks that crash.

Personally, I am looking to put extra monthly income in ETFs such as, ARKK, ARKG, VTI, and VXUS along with QQQ and see what that gets me in the next 3-5 years. I just don’t know at what % to balance each to have a well diversified portfolio. I would like to have QQQ be the largest percentage among these, is there a reason why that is a bad idea? Are there risks involved with QQQ that I have not found? Is now a bad time to get into ETFs and QQQ specifically? Any other information anyone wants to share relating to QQQ  or ETFs in general is welcome.","['INTC', 'IVZ', 'PYPL', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'ARKK', 'FB', 'NVDA', 'NDAQ', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'SPGI', 'MSFT']"

If I want more returns though I would just go pure QQQ. It's still relatively safe/stable compared to holding individual stocks imo. Indexes usually moves 1%/day.

And yes, if the market actually crashes, you would have more things to worry about than the money in the market anyway. And also many times, companies report good earnings yet stock doesn't go up.

Plenty of big tech companies have questionable ethics to put it lightly but for most of them I can see their value to the world and society. Facebook however adds nothing, everything it touches seems to turn to shit.

Are you invested? Do you care about the practices of the company or do prioritize growth?

I'm trying to form an idea of how this stock will perform over the next 20 years when the old garde of investors starts to disappear and be replaced by the new.

Edit: it doesn't matter to me if you have your money in FB and I judge no one for their decision. We are (mostly) regular people trying to make money, if you see an opportunity you should take it.

If you believe what’s good for everyone is more important that for just one person, it seems like facebook is doing serious heavy lifting for Small and medium businesses then anything we’ve seen before.

Playing devils advocate, facebook financially supports to some degree free internet for over 500m people. Why do you hate that? Facebook also uses their profits to build new cables to create a more robust Internet, is this also despicable? 

In many countries that still don’t have unlimited Messaging or there’s a WiFi but no cell phone service, applications like fb messenger and WhatsApp can hold together communities. Especially in the developing world.

Additionally, the video chat aspect of FB is really good too as well as the marketplace. My friends and I hardly post anything on the platform anymore because it’s become such a garbage heap of human communication. Additionally, I personally don’t use FB on my mobile devices anymore. I log in on my PC once a day, check to see what’s up, and peace out. Additionally, with the limitations being placed on tracking by Apple, I think we are going to see a further shift in the way the platform is used.

n78n3g,,stocks,post,1620420658,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

n6dl5x,,stocks,post,1620324579,"New Investors: The average return of the stock market is 10% per year over time.2020 was an unprecedented year. New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

n70krq,,stocks,post,1620399812,"Is Beyond Meat (BYND) a buy after the recent dip?**Company Description:**

Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in the United States and offers consumers a range of various plant-based meats. This company’s mission is to build meat directly from plants and have their final product consist of the same attributes as actual meat products. Beyond Meat’s products are designed to be more nutritional than that of regular meat, although the nutritional aspects of plant-based meats have been questioned. While plant-based meats may or may not be more nutritional than regular meat, by shifting to plant-based meats people can positively affect growing global issues. The issues which this company is trying to address include human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare. Their products consist of the Beyond Burger, meatballs, sausage, beef, and more. Besides certain Beyond Crumbles, all of their products are certified Kosher and Halal. As of December 2021, you can find Beyond Products available at approximately 122,000 retailer and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries. In addition, Beyond Meat has an e-commerce site which offers consumers bulk packs, mixed product bundles, and trial packs. This company is constantly innovating and their R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of the biggest food companies (Nestle, Kroger, etc.) at 7.8%. Their state-of-the-art innovation center is a 30,000 sq. foot building located in El Segundo California. This company’s mission is simple to understand, through a unique and innovative approach make the best product that gets as close as possible to real meat all while benefiting the planet.

**Total Addressable Market** (TAM)

In 2020 the plant-based meat market was estimated to be valued at $4.3 billion and is projected to reach $8.3 billion by 2025. All that growth registers a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. Much of the growth that we are witnessing is due to the growing vegan, vegetarian, and health conscious trends people are adopting. Also, many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products. All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy, but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems. While the plant-based market may not be the largest, Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry. The global meat industry is valued at $1.2 trillion and had a CAGR of 2.4% between 2015 and 2019. Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price. Beyond Meat’s Beyond Sausage sells for $10.30 a pound, that is about 70% more than regular pork sausage. One pound of factory-farmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around $3/pound, while one pound of Beyond Meat’s Beef Burger will run you around $6.25/pound. While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot, that doesn’t mean that people don’t buy Beyond Meat products. Going forward we’ll have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat market.

**Recent Developments/Acquisitions**

**The new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide (April 27, 2021) –** Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35% less fat and saturated fat, and fewer calories than 80/20 beef. This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd. It will be available in a 2-pack, the brand’s first ever value 4-pack, and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack. Dariush Ajami, the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat, said ” We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plant-based beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience. The new Beyond Burger’s rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef, and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring on-par with 80/20 ground beef burgers.” According to the University of Michigan’s 2018 Life Cycle Assessment, when compared to traditional 80/20 beef burgers, the Beyond Burger has 99% less impact on water scarcity, 93% less impact on land use, requires 46% less energy, and generates 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

**Beyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe (April 12, 2021) –** Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations. The plant-based foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49% over the last two years. In the U.K, Sainsbury’s said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide. Also, Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage. The retailers together increased Beyond Meat’s presence in 445 stores. In Germany, Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1,000 German retail stores through Kaufland, Tegut, Famila, and Real. In Austria, the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1,500 retail stores. Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores. Nearly 1,000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince. Chuck Muth, the Chief Growth Officer at the company, said “These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europe’s appetite for plant-based meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise.” Moreso, in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first co-manufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen World’s Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude Netherland.

**Beyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation (April 7, 2021) –** Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai. Ethan Brown, CEO, said “The opening of our dedicated plant-based meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meat’s ability to effectively compete in one of the world’s largest meat markets. We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth, and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.” Just a little over a year ago, Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks. In addition to Starbucks, Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Jindingxuan, GangLi Beijing, Slow Boat Brewery, Hema, METRO China and more. Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that they’ve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market, Beyond Pork.

**What could go wrong**

**Foodservice doesn’t pick up –** Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries. In the past we’ve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically, only to fall back to where it was before a few days after. Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, KFC, and a number of other restaurants. Looking at the foodservice side of their business, they’ve seen tremendous YoY growth. While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales, many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back. While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward, I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out. Impossible foods is their main competitor and they’ve partnered with the likes of Burger King, White Castle, Red Robin, and others. These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue. The questions that remain to be asked are, in the long-run, how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat? Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plant-based protein products and how many others will follow? Furthermore, Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales. There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then? Nonetheless, I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years.","['WMT', 'KR', 'SBUX', 'EL']"

In short, it seems like the entire tech sector went out of favor for the last quarter. But... if there's a turnaround in the segment, they have some good lights ahead of them. 

TL;DR - Why I'm invested in them. I really do like the company. I'm big into these guys. Maybe with GME's PC Sales push, that'll shine some light on CRSR. Maybe they'll get bought out by MSFT or AMZN who wants a more substantial play into the gaming and streaming market. Not sure, but I'm long on the stock with XXXX shares. 

**Positions**:

*  XXXX shares
* Dec 17 2021 $35C

# Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy. 

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)). 

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR. 

# Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.  

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing. Grassroots matters, but more is needed to go from early adopters to mainstream market.","['PPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']"

Consider this something of a vent and me sharing my thoughts.  I think it's a good read but hey I'm biased.*

Hey guys,

I want to share about one of the emotional issues of investing that I'm sure many of you can relate to, even if it's not talked about much around here.  I wasn't sure about sharing this, but I figured I would because I think it's important, important for me, and like I said, I imagine for others, too, even if we don't usually talk about it.

I've been investing in a Roth IRA for a few years now, but this February marked my first foray into more extensive investing.  I was sitting on a lot of cash thanks to stimulus, less consumption thanks to Covid, and other reasons, and decided now was the time to put it to work.  I got into individual stocks because of GME.  Sometimes I'm kind of ashamed to say it, because there seems to be a negative stigma attached to that, and you know what? I understand why: the meme stock thing can be anywhere from facepalm to totally cringeworthy.  I share that opinion in some ways.  But at the same time I think that moment brought a lot of young folks into the market who actually have taken the time to learn about it and get serious, and I think that's wonderful.

February 2021 was a bad time for a lot of us to get into the market, because a lot of us tried chasing performance in things like ARK funds.  I understand a lot of people got nailed.  Luckily, I was cautious about getting in tech after such a crazy bull run, and I started out quite defensively.  I haven't lost money yet.  I'm slightly up.

But man, I've rebalanced... twice now.  I mean, the initial portfolio, then a complete overhaul, followed by another complete overhaul today. There's been innumerable minor tweaks and adjustments along the way, too.  In theory, my allocations have gotten better as I've gone along.  My second portfolio definitely made more sense than my first, but after this last readjustment I'm left thinking ""what the hell did I even bother to change for?""   What I have now isn't bad, I think, but I'm not sure it's really better than what I had before.  It might even be worse.  I'll have to chew it over a bit.

That's the thing.  Honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I could just make a rule ""alright, what's done is done"", but that's not the best idea, either.  Sometimes things do change.  Sometimes there are better plays.  We learn and what not.  So I don't feel comfortable making a rule about not making any changes, and if I did make a rule, I'd probably break it anyway.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Totally clueless.  Go back to the old allocation?  Keep things as they are?  Wait and see?  I'm leaning towards wait and see.  Just get this stuff of my chest.  Ride the market a little more and keep an open mind.

It's the uncertainty that kills me, man.  Can I afford to bet a good portion of my money on the entire market (ie: VTI?)  Would it be better to hold cash right now?  What about inflation?  How about individual stocks? What if my pick underperforms or goes bankrupt?  There's always black swan events.  And what about my future?  Where will I be in 10 years?  I wish I had all the answers, but I don't.  Nobody knows.  And that can be frustrating.

One last note.  I know people are going to say ""just do index funds and be done with it"".   I already do them - that's all I have in my Roth IRA.  They're a wonderful idea; I get why people love them.  That said, the portfolio I'm talking about here is in a taxable account and it's money I may need in the mid-term.  I'm young, and my future is uncertain.  I don't know if I'm going to need to buy a house soon, or a car, or go back to school.  I have a job but the pay isn't anything to write home about, and it's not necessarily something that I'll be able to do until I retire.  I think a lot of young people can relate.

Yes, I've got my 6-12 months in cash, and I've even got a tier 2 savings fund in series I bonds (inflation protected, check 'em out).  But still.

I don't want to just sit on cash, especially since cash sucks right now.  I want to put that extra money to work, and make some returns, even if they're modest. But at the same time I don't want my whole portfolio to go crashing down 50% suddenly.  I lost the link, if someone has it please let us know, but there's this great website that shows you how your portfolio (in dollar value, not actual allocations) would have been affected in different crashes (dot com bubble, 2008, etc.)  In 2008 a portfolio would decline over 50%, IIRC, and it would take 5 years and 5 months to recover.   Great, right?  Buy and hold.  Long-term time horizon.

Yeah, that's acceptable if you're 30 years old and saving for retirement.  But for me, it's absolutely unacceptable if I need that money to put a down payment on a house in the next 3-5 years.  You see?

I wish people would be a bit more open-minded when it comes to constantly recommending index funds.  Like I said, I think they're a wonderful idea - probably the best for retirement.  But at the same time every case is different, and every market is different.  Totally wonderful to recommend them, but maybe the downvoting and criticism needs to be cut back a bit.  Dialogue would be nice.  Comprehension. Not everyone has the same goals, needs, or time horizons.  We're all learning here, and nobody has the definitive answer for anyone's financial situation, especially not for yours.

Anyway, that's all guys.  Love to hear your thoughts, feelings, and feedback.  All the best and good luck to everyone.",
n7bqw5,gxbyms9,stocks,comment,1620430347,">I don't know what to do anymore. Totally clueless.

you don't need to figure it all out today. just take a break. go read a novel or walk the dog. leave the portfolio alone for a few weeks. clear your head.

IMO investors should have a core position of something low-feethat covers the entire market or a cross section of the market. there's nothing wrong with augmenting that with some speciality/sector funds or active management or other strategies. there are many roads to heaven, to paraphrase Warren Buffett. there's research showing the most important thing is just saving money into whatever options are a available. 

In a taxable account, ETFs can have an edge over index funds/mutual funds. ETFs are usually structured to minimize capital gains. 

as a general rule, investing is for money you can leave alone for several years. 5 years is the usual guideline, because ~90% of any 5 year periods have a gain. if you'll need this money in as little as 3 years I would not invest all of it. part of it? sure. but the rest is fine in a CD, savings account. don't obsess over every last dollar needing to aggressively earn more money for you. nothing wrong with a big fat savings account. most people have $1000 or less in the bank. 

might want to look at a low-volatility ETF for the taxable account. they will have a ""beta"" lower than 1. VTI has a beta of about 1, meaning it moves exactly with the market because it IS the market. ARK funds will have beta of about 1.5 to 1.7, or 50-70% more volatile than the market. In contrast, a low-volatility ETF will have a beta of maybe .6 ... so it's LESS volatile than the market, the ups and downs will probably be less intense.  low volatility will be less prone to sharp drops in a crisis. here's one, for example, look under ""portfolio characteristics"".

Stocks going down is normal, sure.

What isn’t normal is stock going down after crushing analysts estimates. Stocks going down after posting record breaking revenues. That is not new for small growth stocks, but for major corporations, that is new territory. 

ETSY is a good example. It sank 10% because it got downgraded by analysts this week. Then sank another 15% today because it beat analysts forecasts... but not by enough. Two years ago, if they posted the same analyst beat numbers, they pop 10% that day.

Lots of big tech have crushed analysts estimates across the board and have seen basically no movement.

But now we are seeing crazy forward earnings already being priced in.

Then we got the Fed operating like a circus. The government putting the population in a cash fan tube. Unemployment being more profitable than most hourly paid positions in the country.

Back when the yield was over 7% it was a no brainer. I still think it's p good at 5.6%, just not much better than investing in, say, SPY.

Similar story with BP. Very well run companies with a very high dividend yield (the skepticism being warranted in BP's case given they slashed it previously) for companies of their size. If the equity tanks, you're getting cash flow from the dividend to stick around and wait it out. I think they're good moves.",['XOM']

So far I've found that CCI, ADX and ADL are very helpful for daytrading for me and I've noticed that I'm making better decisions based on them - it's so much easier to see the trend and momentum with them. I've also found EMA clouds and trying to integrate them in my analysis, but I'm still not sure if I understand their purpose correctly.

Currently, I've got the following EMA's: 5-13, 34-50, 72-79, but I'm not sure how useful they are for given timeframes, meaning is 5-13 cloud better on 1 minute chart or 5 minute chart? I've seen stocks finding support on the top or bottom of the the same cloud, but one would do it on a 5 minute chart, the other on 1 minute chart.

Is there any general rule to follow here or maybe each pattern is different and I should find the timeframe that correlates with these clouds the best?

Another question is a bit more simple, but I need a confirmation - are tops and bottoms of these clouds treated as additional support levels?

n6ynt9,,stocks,post,1620394587,"Can someone explain why selling and buying a stock/asset back at a lower cost is a stupid idea when it dips?So yes I am a new investor and I’m trying to understand this. Let’s say for example Stock X is $10. It has a good run up to  $70 over a course of 2 months and because of its high run up and RSI, you know that there will be a pull back. Let’s say now you invested 100k. This 100k has essentially 7x to 700k, but since you did not sell it at $70, it then pulled all the way back to $30 so you now have 300k. You've essentially lost out of 400k profit before tax is considered.

Why do people say it’s stupid to sell it just to rebuy it back? If you knew there would be a pull back due to the RSI, sell at $70, then rebuy the dip when it’s back at $30? Sure you pay short term capital gains but you’ve now doubled your position at the same price, assuming you reinstate all that money back into that stock. You can now increase your position, but just pay a higher average cost of $30 rather than at $10. What am I not understanding for those that hold when you know the RSI will indicate a strong dip?

I didn't want to gamble on earnings, as the price might have gone up or down 5-10%, so I just waited until their announcement. As it turns out, they beat earnings, and its price went up 5-10%. I kept waiting for its price to get a correction, but for the past week, it's literally gone up about 1-2% everyday for the last 5 days since they announced earnings.

It's now up about 10-12% from when I first wanted to buy it. It's not a tech stock and actually considered more of a ""boomer"" stock, so it might not go to the moon like a tech stock. It's still undervalued at this point, but its upside has gotten smaller after going up 10-12% already.

Its price was largely flat and boring for this year, so the 10-12% jump in price looks sort of unusual.

For a variety of reasons:Steel manufacturing companies are set to make record profits in the next few years. Demand is up huge. [The post-COVID boom is starting.](https://www.appraisalbuzz.com/biggest-construction-boom-since-2006-best-2-weeks-for-rates-in-a-year/) The rotation out of tech is under way. And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:

-----------------------------------

**Steel prices are obscenely high**

These are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 – 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) 

And this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) 

This means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).

--------------------------------

**Inflation**

The hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation? Many expect inflation to climb regardless as there has been so much money printed. During periods of high inflation, Michael Burry thinks you want to be in [real estate and commodities](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859/photo/1). 

And even if inflation doesn’t cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.

------------------------------------

**China's rebate**

In 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world’s steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.

But now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. 

Starting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff & 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it’s getting a lot worse.

Starting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor’s product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.

**Where in particular to invest?** 

Steel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)

There is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.

CLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will ""look after shareholders"" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.

CLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.

As people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. 

MT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade. [Commodities Boom Grips Steel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/arcelormittal-reports-best-quarter-in-decade-as-steel-joins-boom) 

And these amazing Q1 numbers don't even fully account for the new record high prices. Steel's day is just beginning. This is not a buy-today and sell-tomorrow play, this is a buy-sometime-soon and hold-for-a-long-time play.

Positions: I have shares and LEAPs in CLF and MT at a variety of strikes.","['TWTR', 'AAPL']"

n6xphy,,stocks,post,1620391716,"CRWD valuation and upcoming earnings on May 31Crowdstrike is a cyber security company that provides end host security to prevent breaches and data theft. They have earnings on June 3 for Q1FY22. They posted Q4FY21 earnings on March 18, at one of the brutal red days of the Nasdaq+tech fuckfest.

Currently, CRWD is trading at December 17 levels. Lets take a look at its current valuation and try to understand its short term and long term upsides. We can also compare CRWD to NET and see where the valuations sit.

First lets look at Q4 and FY2021.

https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/8906/html

The biggest thing to note here is that CRWD is on a 100% yoy revenue trajectory. This is impressive as they've done this for 4 years straight. In FY2021, they were able to pull in $874M revenue, growth of 81% yoy. Their profit also grew 89% comparatively as they were able to drive down the costs of both their product and services increasing margin for both.

Taking into account FY21 revenue, their current P/S value is 48 (42B mktcap by 874M sales). If CRWD announces first quarter revenue of $380M, which would project it for another 80% YoY growth, then consider the stock price to go back up to $220 as we'll try to project to a P/S of 48. If CRWD earnings drop below that, I could see the stock drop to $150 at growth has slowed and the P/S would no longer justify its valuation.

Looking at their projections from their April investor relations deck:
https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/2852082c-2ce8-4d5d-96ad-0e2cb1bd8edc

CRWD is expecting to hit $3Bn ARR in 2025. As of FY2021, they are are $1Bn ARR. 

Overall, I think CRWD is fairly priced currently at $190 compared to other high performing industryplayers. I think CRWD can easily get to $220 based on speculation or if they have a good revenue Q1. I think $240 is very reasonable by end of year due to secular trends in security concerns. Their investor presentation is compelling, showing large TAM growth and tailwinds in cybersecurity. Additionally, over the next 4 years, CRWD is planning to release new products that break into new markets that increase their TAM by 2x (from 44Bn in 2021 to 106Bn in FY25). Compare this to how the market reacted when NET released their serverless platform and the stock jumped 15%. Tackling a new market creates strong tailwinds in growth.

Betting on CRWD at this current price is betting that cyber security and endpoint protection will be critical for large businesses going forward. Do you believe that corporations will see nation state and corporate sponsored cyber security attacks going forward? If so, Crowdstrike is a place you should be seriously considering putting money.

I got into CRWD at $185, but I unfortunately averaged up to a cost average of $209. Seeing CRWD at $190 feels like a fair price, and anything below $180 feels like a deal. The upside potential with regards to risk/reward feels good below $180. At around $200, it could go either way and you may just break even short term.

Long term, I think CRWD has the legs to grow 20% this year.","['IR', 'NDAQ']"

To give some context, they had to do a product recall on their treadmills due to some injuries. Their treadmills represent about 2-3% of their total sales and the stock dipped about 15%. Quite honestly this seems like a massive overreaction. Don’t see a massive risk here as their bikes are the major driver of their business. Even pricing in a few lawsuits and costs related to the recall, I don’t think a 15% dip was justified. 

Basic math/logic above coupled with the fact that everyone I know who has a peloton bike is absolutely obsessed with it lead me to scoop up some shares around $83 this week.

Seeing their incredibly low churn rate on subscriptions and high engagement in their content  (26 workouts / month?!) is encouraging. Yeah, the fitness market is tough, but their secret sauce is and will be content, talent and ecosystem. The subscription model is cheap compared to a gum membership for their target market and they have plans for more hardware to attract more customers.

Biggest threat is probably Apple - they launched their own fitness content and already have strong shares in hardware and adoption.

First time poster. I have been thinking about the future of tech investments. As some background, I work in the field of competition law & regulation. Currently there are cases against Google and Facebook in the US, the latter may even lead to divestiture or total breaking up of the ecosystem.

Aside from that there is regulation on the way in the EU, the DMA and DSA will have far reaching consequences for the profitability of app stores, causing me concerns about Apple. Aside from that Amazon is under investigation as well. Aside from app stores there are also strict rules surrounding search engines. 

Right now I feel like only Amazon and Microsoft will be able to deal properly with the fallout of the changing regulatory landscape. Amazon as it is so diversified that it's a safe bet somewhat. However, I'm worried that Amazon is already so high (and public opinion of their employment terms are so bad) that there will be some inevitable fallout.

Now I'm left wondering if Microsoft is the right long-term investment. They are not overly data reliant and are building up positions in more and more areas for professional software. The only thing that concerns me is that Microsoft has a bad track record when it comes to being innovative. I fear some of their projects will ultimately fail as they are becoming perhaps the ""dinosaur"" of the tech world.

n738o2,,stocks,post,1620406674,"Confirmation about Options tradingI recently saw (on WSB) people have bought call options for $800 for around $5 and I was playing it through my head and I obviously thought it was a really stupid play and am relatively new to Options so I just wanted to get confirmation on my thoughts. 

So when you buy a call option you are buying a contract with the ""Right but not the obligation"" to buy the stock at the strike price but you aren't actually buying the stock.

So IF GME went up to $805 before the expiration date the value if you sold the option the profit would not be huge, it would be it would only be a few dollars per share",
n738o2,gxal4lr,stocks,comment,1620406972,"Depends on how much time is left before expiration.  At $805, there is $5 in intrinsic value plus any time value left.",
n738o2,gxarvfm,stocks,comment,1620409884,"Most people who trade options, particularly buying call or out options are not wanting to actually exercise them but are making a bet on the direction the stock will move.

So in your example, if GME moved closer to $800 per share, the option they are holding would be come more valuable. So, they could sell that option contract and make a profit.

If it moved down, the option contract will become less valuable.

But most people who buy option contracts either let them expire worthless or sell them for a profit before expiration.",
n738o2,gxb5tdk,stocks,comment,1620416263,"If the value of GME went up to 800 the option would be at the money (ATM). It would be worth more than a present-day GME 160 call at the same expiry if GME shot to 800 tommrow.

So your 5$ option would be around $50 (looking at 11/19 gme calls) minus whatever theta from days passed, plus whatever gained in implied volatility from the stock moving from 160 to 800

*when* the stock hits 800 is very important and not included in your example. 

What your saying is only true if you let the option expire, or sell it really close to expiry when most of it's value has already decayed to time",

n6gx5p,,stocks,post,1620333190,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 6, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

Energy is a very good place to be as we exit the pandemic.  And although you are right that most of the profit was winter storm Uri related, it was all good news for ET this quarter. In the conference call management stated they are seeing record volumes in their system right now.  They are also locking in long term contracts at good prices. They guided EBIDTA up and leverage down. 

Also, ET has been a very, very controversial stock. Not so much on reddit but check out how many negative articles have been written about ET on Seeking Alpha.  And ET's price has been very depressed due to a combination of poor strategy (Kelcy Warren is incapable of not buying companies), over leverage, Covid, DAPL pipeline woes,, fossil fuels being in disfavor, etc.  Now all of these factors are starting to move back in ET's favor.  The ENBL acquisition was great!  ENBL had a hell of a quarter (2× estimates).  Market conditions are improving.  DAPL is priced in.  And most importantly, management has finally figured out that the single most important metric right now is reducing leverage.  They have gone from ignoring their over leverage to bragging about reducing their leverage.  They will soon go from credit watch negative to stable..  As these positive factors get priced in you could see a big move up in ET.  Look at MPLX as a guide for what ET will do when the leverage is reduced and they  can repurchase units.

In its semiannual Financial Stability Report, the central bank said that while the system overall has remained largely stable even through the Covid-19 pandemic, future dangers are rising, in particular should the aggressive run on stocks tail off.

“High asset prices in part reflect the continued low level of Treasury yields. However, valuations for some assets are elevated relative to historical norms even when using measures that account for Treasury yields,” the report states. “In this setting, asset prices may be vulnerable to significant declines should risk appetite fall.”

“Vulnerabilities associated with elevated risk appetite are rising. Valuations across a range of asset classes have continued to rise from levels that were already elevated late last year,”",

n6a4a2,,stocks,post,1620315489,"How you should start with investingI've seen a ton of posts recently from new investors asking how they should get started in investing along with a lot of posts from people who have just gotten into the stock market, lost a lot of money and are now panicking. As such I figured I'd just make a quick post to recommend what I feel is the best way to get started in the stock market.

**Step 1: Take 90% of your capital that you would like to invest and put it in a total market index fund like VTI or FZROX**

You're new at this, no matter how much research you have done you don't know what you're doing and will make mistakes. Putting your money into an index fund will give you good returns along with the security of knowing with 99.999% certainty that if there is a dip it WILL recover (and if it doesn't you probably have bigger problems to worry about). It will also help you get used to the ups and downs of the market without getting emotional.

**Step 2: Start paper trading**

Most brokerages offer a ""paper trading"" account. These are accounts where you invest with fake money and can track how you would have done with these investments. I know you're excited and want to start investing now so you can make money, but you're new and will likely fall into one of several common pitfalls of new investors, better to do this with fake money than real money. And besides if you follow step 1 your money *is* invested and you are getting good returns.

**Step 3*: Start using your 10% cash to make real stock purchases**

 Once you do well after a few months to a year of paper trading (it seems like a long time I know but trust me the stock market will still be there when you're done), take some of your remaining capital and start buying stocks. Real investing is not like paper trading when it comes to your actual money, keep that in mind. You will find yourself panicking for the first time here, that's fine, remember the vast majority of your money is in a solid investment with little risk and good returns.

**Step 4*: Start moving more into stock picks**

After a few years of doing well with your 10%, if you feel like you'd rather pick your own stocks over using an index fund then start moving money out of your total market index funds into individual stock picks

And that's it, that's (in my opinion) the best way to get started in the stock market. Any additional tips from you guys?

*These steps aren't actually necessary, you can just leave 100% of your capital in total market index funds and you will be fine, in fact that's what I would recommend you do but I realize that many people, especially those that come to this subreddit, would rather take their chances and try to outperform the market",['UPS']

It is good information if you want to either roll your call, or close out your position. For instance, I have a covered call out there expiring today, that is currently ITM for someone out there. It isn't heavily in the money, only roughly 20 cents/share, so I have to debate if I want to take the hit to close out the option (costing me about $75) or, just let the shares get called away which may not happen by market close anyways. I have sold enough calls on these shares to generate a few hundred over my time holding it, so... kind of a coin flip decision.",
n6byd0,,stocks,post,1620320311,"VIAC is very undervalued in an overvalued market and just had an amazing earnings reportVIAC is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping.","['NFLX', 'VIAC']"

However, it seems the market won't value this company more than it is.

Look at their [2018-Q4 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/d50946cf-2bb8-441f-a8ad-a8e118ff44cf): Revenues: 7B, EPS: 1.43. Share price back then: $43.72

Look at their [2021-Q1 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/78a9d2e0-5f09-4f6f-b890-45b139769eff): Revenues: 7.4B, EPS: 1.42. Share price now: $38.15

So they had the same results in 2018 than on 2021 and the share price is just $5 dollars of difference.

The market is showing the same love for this company now than in 2018.

Why is this company more worth now than in 2018? The competition from Netflix and other online platforms can't be ignored.

EDIT: look at the PEG ratio fo this company.. is negative.

Is it seriously that ppl don't want to work and are taking advantage of the system? Or is it that wages aren't replicating the work force shortage?

n6uhtc,,stocks,post,1620379484,"Is 9 stocks enough? (mid-term dividend portfolio)Hey guys,

I put some money in a target retirement fund in a Roth IRA every year.  Recently however for various reasons (Covid, stimulus, etc.) I'm sitting on a lot of extra cash.  I already put a lot in series I bonds (inflation-protected), but I think I can do better than that and want to invest a good bit in taxable account as well.  For now I don't need the money, and I've got my 1st tier (cash) and 2nd tier (savings bonds) emergency funds set already.  But looking at a 3-5 year time horizon there's a lot of uncertainty for me right now and I may have some big purchases (major home renovations, back to school, new car, etc.)   Again, though, I don't just want to sit on cash or savings bonds and miss out on gains.

Right now my taxable account has 50% index funds (VTI and VXUS).  These are great long-term plays but I'm worried about having total market exposure in the event that I need to pull out equity at some point.  The absolute worst thing that could happen would be for markets to drop 30% right when I need to access that cash.

Thus I'm considering creating a fully defensive portfolio for the meantime, collecting dividends with some hopes for modest capital appreciation.  I have 9 stocks that I already own or that are on my watchlist.  My question is that if this will provide enough diversification for the short-to-mid term.  If you're interested, here they are:

1. MSFT
2. AAPL (these two are not for dividends, I just think they're solid companies worth holding in any portfolio)
3. BTI
4. IMBBY
5. PM
6. MO
7. UVV (3-7 are tobacco companies)
8. KO
9. PAAS (mining stock / inflation hedge)

Everything would be about equally weighted with some minor variations.

Obviously I'm way overweight on tobacco but I've done research into the industry and in the next decade or so these companies aren't going anywhere.  Hell, I'm confident even on a longer time horizon and already hold a couple of these in my portfolio.  I do see long-term risk because it's a declining industry, but again, I anticipate ample time to get out and/or rebalance.

I don't anticipate any of these companies suddenly going bankrupt... they have good balance sheets and strong cash flows.  That said, I am concerned that some unforeseen event could wipe out 10%+ of my portfolio.  I think mid-term this portfolio makes sense, but I'm new to this, so I just want to see what more experienced people think about the soundness of this allocation.

I'll also take any recommendations if you want to help bump me up to 10+. =\]","['AAPL', 'KO', 'MO', 'MSFT', 'PM']"

I would suggest you pick the one or two tobacco stocks you are most confident in and load up on just them (my personal vote is BTI). 

Other stocks/industries that held up like soldiers last March are telecom, defense, and big pharma. VZ, LMT, LHX, BMY, MRK, and ABBV are ones off the top of my head. You’d get some industry diversification with those and Buffett owns the listed telco and big pharma stocks.

My investments are pretty diversified; Real Estate, Stocks, CDs, Pokemon cards (joking!), etc. I've been reading a lot of positive things about having a portion of your portfolio dedicated to dividends. I'm interested and looking for ideas. I'm sure if we get enough heads
 together we can come up with some ideas to not only help me but other people as well.

Personally, I'm looking for mostly sideways-ish trading stocks, low priced, with a decent dividend payment. Doesn't have to meet those things exactly I guess it mostly just depends on the stock/company.

For example, $ORC (Orchid Island) mostly trades sideways. Has a monthly dividend of .07 and is low priced at currently $5.50 per share. That means with a 150k investment you could buy 27,272 shares and have a monthly dividend payment of $1900 per month (roughly).

n6c01m,gx6d6l0,stocks,comment,1620323754,"What is a good valuation?

NET got clobbered today because FSLY put up weak growth numbers and the market reacted heavily.

NET was trading at $25 before the COVID mess took over, and its been on a 3x rocket ship trajectory ever since.

NET has higher margins than FSLY, operates in a more diverse space and has a different value proposition. With a wider base of customers and larger margins, NET may fair better than FSLY in earnings.

That being said, what is a good valuation for NET in your opinion?

The lowest NET has gotten in the past 6 months is $61 on March 8 at the bottom of the bump.

Do you think that's a fair price for NET?

I'm a big holder of NET, and have been adding over the past year. Its a shame to see it get blown up and caught up in the recently reversion to mean of cloud stocks.

As a relative measure, on February 11 NET had their annual report. Their revenue was $431M, up 50% yoy with a cagr of 50% yoy for 5 years. To maintain that growth, NET needs to put up revenues of about $160M. The current estimates are about $130M. If NET misses this price at all, I think it free-falls all teh way to the low 50's.

They're definitely an expensive company, and depending on your horizons getting in at $60 may be a good entry. But with a volatile stock like this, consider a DCA strategy since it can bounce around a lot.

If you do decide to lump sum into NET, consider buying PUTS to hedge against short term bounces.",

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.",['SPGI']

The regulatory hurtles, the land that would need to be baught, the man power it would take to build a new railroad network is just out of the question.

So what are we left with? The only companies that still exist. And they are all prospering.

Me, I chose CNI.

Canadian National Railway. (CNI or CNR)

Just had a huge dip after the KCS offer. Perfect time to get in while the market is down.

If they dont get the railway, their SP should shoot back up. If they do get it, theyll have the first transcontinental railway going from across Canada down to Mexico.

Win win in my opinion.


Eidt: ok ok. To everyone saying self driving or electric trucks.

You realize CN and CP also use trucks. So they too would be using these electric trucks or self driving trucks.

 You also forget there is a lot of time saved going by rail rather than by road.

Rails reduce a lot of traffic on the roads, if all freight were moved by trucks the roads would be a warzone.",

n7cmlw,,investing,post,1620431992,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returnsRecent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?",['ARKK']

n7802u,,investing,post,1620418954,"Competition is Growing in the Telehealth SectorThe pandemic has changed a lot of things for good, including healthcare. Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

This was the same organization which produced an article which I read in late January of this year detailing how  AMC stock should basically be worthless because AMC was going to die, and this was despite the recent loan AMC had received and the covid vaccine which was now available.

I read that article after I had entered a market buy for AMC stock to the tune of $50,000. I canceled my buy order because of that article to look for other stocks. I knew nothing about the short squeeze. in fact, when I put in the order for those 50,000 shares I figured that perhaps AMC stock would recover to roughly $5 or $6 per share, which would have been excellent within roughly 6 months to a year having purchased at about $3.25 a share. I think a week later and had gone all the way up to $19 a share.


So, with Bitcoin at record highs and aetherium add something like five times the price that it was at the end of 2020 oh, is this nothing more then carefully placed corporate media elitist funded anti cryptocurrency propaganda? it doesn't have no other purpose other than to undermine confidence in non-state controlled currency which cannot be regulated in the same way?

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

2020 LIST OF STOCKS:

* ABMD
* ADBE
* ANET
* BWXT
* CRL
* DG
* ENR
* ETSY
* EXEL
* ISRG
* KLAC
* LKQ
* LRCX
* MNST
* MPWR
* MTCH
* OLED
* PAYC
* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

\*I    am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to   ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results   and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t    understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and    henceforth. You are welcome to do whatever you like with the    information, though if you’re going to sell it that’s some pretty messed    up \*\*\*\*.

n6dh3d,,investing,post,1620324294,"I sold every share I own today.I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

So, I am buying the S&P. It's the boring thing to do, but I will be able to sleep at night and not spend everyday inside staring at a screen. I should have done it much sooner. Rant over.","['SPGI', 'TSLA', 'TWTR']"

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['NFLX', 'WMT', 'AMZN']"

Not only will this eliminate wages paid to the drivers but it will eliminate tips and will reduce the delivery expense for customers.   Currently they are testing delivery robots in certain cities but these are only really feasible in dense urban areas where the delivery distance is relatively short.  Solutions for longer distances have been in the prototype phase for years which include aerial drones for at least some portion of the total distance but this will take much longer to come to market as it is dependent on FAA laws and regulations which are still being developed.,
n70yxb,gxagphz,investing,comment,1620405088,"No. They will never be profitable.  The entire industry is currently subsidized by venture capital funding.  That is to say, investors in the delivery service paid $10 of your $60 food order.

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.","['ED', 'PM']"

n7pr3w,,investing,post,1620482197,"Do individual stocks have their own 'personality'?Hi,

I've noticed that a good number of serious, professional and semi-professional intraday and swing traders focus on a couple of dozen stocks. My question is, do stocks have their own unique personalities, and if they do, what are the best ways to learn what they are?

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

Thanks,

I remember there used to be something called the “superbowl” indicator where someone figured out that if a team from the old AFL won the superbowl it predicted with 90% accuracy what the stock market would do that year.  Of course it eventually stopped working so well because it was just the human brain trying to fit a pattern to random historical data.  The other thing is that even when there is a consistent pattern, if the pattern is detected by enough traders, the form of the pattern will be changed by their trading.  For example, suppose a stock always went up on Thursday morning.  Traders would start buying like crazy on Wednesday afternoon in anticipation, which would make the stock go up Wednesday afternoon instead of Thursday morning.",['AFL']

When I started trading I treated all stocks the same, and for a long while that meant I would consistently underestimate TSLA and sell too low too soon, or expect a correction that never came, meanwhile I'd overestimate NFLX just a little and set limit orders a bit too high so that it never sold before coming back down. After a while you do get a feel for how certain individual stocks behave, you adjust accordingly and when you do better with day trading or swing trading those stocks specifically, it can encourage you to focus on a group of favourites that you're familiar with. When you're looking at something new, I found it good practice to try and estimate a good entry before buying, wait and see how close you were, and hold off buying until your estimates are close to what happens. Following that with discipline has saved me from more FOMO mistakes than it has cost me lost opportunities.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210507005048/en/NuScale-Engages-Guggenheim-Securities-to-Explore-Financing-Options

I’m personally optimistic about the future of nuclear companies due to their potential contributions to any goals towards reducing carbon emissions. There’s no way we’re going to meet these targets without a large push to nuclear, and it seems like NuScale is the furthest ahead out of the new technologies. For example, they are the only SMR to have an approved design by the NRC, and I think it’s only a matter of time before they get more customers signing up to get plants in the US and around the world. 

Looking at Guggenheim’s history, it seems like they have steered similar companies towards a SPAC offering. How can I try and get in on any public offering if they are looking to go this route?",

Example,  right now the NRC has minimum control room staffing requirements for a single reactor control room and slightly different for two reactors with a combined control room.  This isn't going to ever be profitable for a 50 MW reactor.  The success path is that they could gang 10 together with a single control room crew (500 MW).  Unfortunately the regulations don't support that at all, the NRC would require a minimum of three control room operators per reactor.

Also, if you have access to this data, what is your risk metrics such as Standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, Alpha, Beta, R squared.

My idea is that in order to beat the market, most people have to take outsize risks.  Me for example.  Here is my stats...

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

n6fysa,,investing,post,1620330775,"In just 3 months, Tesla has issued 80% of the shares ARK's valuation model projected they would issue through 2025.Their model is beyond amateurish.  Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

First off their ""bull case"" assumes its possible for them to achieve $327 billion in JUST robo-taxi revenue (a non-existent technology) by 2025! That is more revenue than Apple makes selling all their products and services. Where do they think that money would come from? That is like 30x what Uber currently brings in. If it was even possible to make like 1/2 of that, why would Tesla even be selling cars in the first place? Why not just run the fleet of taxis?
Here is a video of saying that Tesla would have FOR SURE 1 million robo-taxis on the road by last year:

What a joke...

Ok now for their ""bear case""...
This involves the projection of Tesla achieving $42 billion in human driven ride hailing revenue (4x what uber makes now). Ya, not happening. Also, creating a $23 billion insurance business out of thin air. Progressive Insurance for reference, has a revenue of $40 billion or so revenue, which took them many decades to build. Here is an expert in insurance valuation and founder of Semper Augustus hedge fund Chris Bloomstran, explaining how idiotic this projection is: https://tweet.lambda.dance/ChrisBloomstran/status/1373410803559321614

Here are Tesla's current revenue numbers on those areas:

**Robo-Taxi Ride Hailing: $0**

**Human Driven Ride-Hailing: $0**

**Auto Insurance: $0**

n5z0z4,,investing,post,1620274920,"Uber investors finally see the costs of treating drivers as employees, and the stock is falling. Uber sets aside $600 million for U.K. drivers as a result of court findinghttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-investors-finally-see-the-costs-of-treating-drivers-as-employees-and-the-stock-is-falling-11620265604

Uber Technologies Inc. has spent and fought to keep its drivers from becoming classified as employees instead of contractors, and investors finally got a glimpse of the financial reasons on Wednesday.

Uber UBER, -3.42% broke out $600 million from its total revenue of $3.5 billion to account “for the resolution of historical claims in the U.K. relating to the classification of drivers” in its first-quarter earnings results. That is a direct result of a U.K. Supreme Court ruling in March that led Uber to classify tens of thousands of drivers in the U.K. as employees.

Uber disclosed in March that it could have to pay claims of back pay due from British drivers in the case, including holiday pay, wages to equal the minimum and, potentially, pension contributions. That would be on top of what the company already paid the drivers in the 2016 case.

That puts a dollar figure on a longstanding concern about Uber and the other “gig work” companies — what it would look like financially if they had to treat drivers as employees. And it is nothing to sneeze at, blowing away the $200 million Uber and other gig companies spent to pass a new law in California in their quest for a “third way” for employment law. That win could be moot, though, as President Joe Biden’s new secretary of the Labor Department said last week drivers should receive the benefits of employment in most cases, spooking some investors.

For more: Here is how the Biden administration could change gig work

Uber shares initially went higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company papered over the “accrual” and continuing losses with the $1.6 billion sale of its self-driving unit, but fell back to a 4.8% decline in the extended session as executives discussed increasing costs for drivers and faced an immediate question about Labor Secretary Marty Walsh’s comments.

“When we look at the makeup of the current administration, it’s fair to say that there are individuals who have varying views on these issues. They’re not all identical in their outlook. And we think that creates space for some meaningful dialogue,” said Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West, who worked in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama.

The company’s standard mantra when asked about the possible costs of classifying its drivers as employees has been to say that they will pass on the costs to its users, which executives said again during Wednesday’s call. They noted that they did see a slight increase in costs in the quarter, because of driver benefits, and they were able to pass those costs on to riders, with no impact on demand.

See also: Uber and Lyft are public, so the cheap rides are coming to an end

“We are leaning in, with investments to support the recovery mobility and growth initiatives and delivery,” said Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, noting that the ride-hailing company plans to invest in its driver base, and increase its spending in general, marketing and administrative costs, and in R&D. Chai estimated Uber will spend between $450 million and $480 million in the second quarter, after a drop in spending last quarter. Also included will be spending on marketing to attract new drivers, as it faces driver shortages in the U.S. and Mexico.

At the same time, Chai noted that the company continues to face “significant forecasting uncertainty and predicting posts reopening consumer behavior.”

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said that investors were not happy with the higher spending, and pointed to the U.K. charge/accrual as highlighting the hot-button issue of possible further regulation over the classification of its drivers.

“Higher level of investments near term, coupled with some uncertainty around the forecast,” were affecting the shares in after-hours trading, Ives said in an email. “It was a robust print, but after the Biden move against gig players, the Street is very nervous around Uber and Lyft, with selling post-quarter a theme commonplace during tech earnings season.”

Even so, investors now have an idea of how much drivers being classified as employees could cost the company. As the debate over gig workers continues, investors will likely remain jittery about the issue. The nagging question above all is, will companies like Uber and Lyft Inc. LYFT, -6.34% ever be profitable, with their contractor business models again at risk, and prone to big, unexpected costs?",

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

I need to look into the growth further.  However, it's concerning to me because they just reached profitability in 2020.  A quick look shows revenue growth could decline from 14% to 10% in the next 2 years.  That's down from 40% just a few years ago.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

• The company did not offer a full-year forecast with its results, but would provide revised guidance on the earnings conference call later today.

• For the quarter, connected fitness subscriptions and paid digital subscriptions jumped to $1.02B and 891K, both exceeding analyst consensus estimates.

• Peloton said delivery times for its original exercise bike have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, but ""While progress has been made, additional work remains to reduce delivery times across the remainder of our product portfolio and regions.""

• While noting that a recall of its treadmills would knock $165M off FQ4 revenues, CFO Jill Woodworth forecast quarterly sales of $915M and an annual total of $4B, not far off previous annual guidance for $4.08B in sales.

n6rgw5,,investing,post,1620366351,"Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500Hi,

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","['NVDA', 'NFLX', 'ADBE', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'SPGI', 'MSFT']"

While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.","['MMM', 'TSLA']"

n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['KO', 'SPGI', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

TL;DR Warren & Munger ""Our wives are filthy casuals""","['SPGI', 'WFC', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx62vky,investing,comment,1620319497,"I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN']"

n6dntx,gx6vsvo,investing,comment,1620331436,"Valuing a company is always personal, it is about what and where you see the company going in your eyes and then transforming this into numbers.

Now you talk about valuing a company, FCF and market ratios in the same sentence, but market ratios refer to what the market values a company at, and that is already reflected in the stock price (pricing).

So do you want to price your company or value it (intrinsic value)? And to me it sounds like you want somebody else to do that for you (asking for a tool), but keep in mind that valuations reflect personal projections and can vary heavily based on whoever or whatever valued it.

If you want to actually learn how to value young/growth companies yourself, then I suggest this:

Generally a good way to value a growth stock at first glance is looking at the market cap and then looking at the revenues they bring in and seeing what the annual growth rate is for that revenue year over year. That is how you get the price to sales and assess if the growth rate justifies the valuation it is trading at. Then I would look into earnings and financial statements to see how the path to profitability could play out and what their debt to equity is and how much cash they are burning. Of course you should do a much deeper dive and look at their quarterly statements, look at their management and leadership, and the fundamental aspects of the business.

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

n62yvd,gx4ptgu,investing,comment,1620292253,"Personally I have always believed the buy price is very important for achieving solid long term results. E.g. buying a company that grows 10% a year at half price over time would give you almost the same amount of gain as investing in a company the grows 20% a year at full price, assuming market valuation appreciates to fair value. Of course a 20% growing company would have a much higher valuation, but a 10% annual gain compounded by a 100% appreciation to fair value would give you very decent returns. 

The maths of course is not accurate, but is the theory roughly correct?",
n5yd5o,,investing,post,1620272502,"Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?Hi r/investing,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

Since I am new to value investing, am I missing something here? Or, is this a good pick to buy-and-hold?","['TSLA', 'PEG']"
n5yd5o,gx5iiqs,investing,comment,1620310822,"Approving the comment but with some guidance:  Even though the stock is undervalued, I encourage you to come to the table with a more thorough analysis.  A thorough discussion of valuation is going to do more than look at various ratios of earnings.  For example:

1. What's the FCF-based fair value?
2. What's the delta of Ford's forward P/E in each of the past five quarters to its actual P/E?  In other words, how much did positive earnings materialize into stock price appreciation?
3. What is the historical and forward P/E comparison to Ford's peers?  The automotive industry is exceptionally capital intensive with not staggeringly high margins.
4. What are the risk factors unique to the automotive industry?  Investors have been as shy of automotive stocks as they have been of airline stocks, two industries that required a LOT of public subsidy over the past five decades, and are now facing a transformation challenge: spurred on by the $2 billion settlement of VW AG over its emissions scandals, automotive makers have an incentive to convert their production to EV's but at what cost?  Is Ford ahead or behind its peers in this regard?
5. There's not a lot in their financial statements that looks glaringly bad (some commentary on non cash items, discontinued operations and capital lease obligations is welcome but not materially significant) but a few things should be at least commented on including that three of the past five quarters they posted a net operating loss... Granted, that owes to the pandemic but when we look at history, even before the pandemic the stock price never rose above $14 per share and hovered for quite a while around $10, currently trading at $11.5399.  So the market's not really moved the price even remotely close to the FCF fair value in the last half decade... What implications might that have for the expected return?  That may or may not matter depending on the type of value investor you're pitching the question to, but it's got to be addressed so they can weigh it.

There are, I'm sure, many other questions that can be raised if given more than the five or six minutes I glanced at the company's data... This is just an example of the kind of questions you should anticipate.",

n5v0cr,,investing,post,1620261362,"Teladoc Stock is Down Another 8% This Week. Don’t Just Blame Poor Earnings.""The stock has been under pressure for the past few months since the firm signaled that it [expects little membership growth in 2021](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teladoc-stock-falls-on-downbeat-forecast-for-membership-51614267007?mod=article_inline). A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

n5w1a9,,investing,post,1620264703,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DDVista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",

n5lead,,investing,post,1620235477,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

n5jbxh,,investing,post,1620230375,"Limiting turnover in levered portfoliosAfter spending a bit too much time reading  ~~papers~~ marketing pieces from AQR, I'm fully convinced that a ""balanced portfolio"" (ie less stocks, more bonds and alts than the 100/0) levered up to the risk of stocks should beat the pants off everyone's favourite 100/0 while cutting the tails somewhat, even with realistic financing costs and transaction costs  (cursory look at Alpha Architect's ~~material~~ sales pitches for high turnover products)

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

Or am I missing something else entirely?",['ES']

n5jbxh,gx1mkfe,investing,comment,1620233029,"If you buy ETFs financed with margin or box spreads, you could realize losses to prevent the leverage ratio increasing over your target. I know you said you did not want to realize losses, but you could use the losses to realize gains (and step up your bases) by selling and buying similar but not equivalent ETFs to make sure those losses are not wasted.

Now might not be the best time to start a leveraged portfolio combining stocks+bonds. The portfolio works best when stocks and bonds are negatively correlated - we have flight to safety to bonds when stocks drop, we have a Fed dropping rates when things are scary, and we have minimal inflation (which may cause stocks and bonds to be positively correlated). Right now inflation may be a risk and the Fed may not have room to drop rates any lower. Any thoughts on this?

> If we gather plugin sales by Automotive Groups, Tesla ended the first quarter of the year in the lead, with 16% share, 3% less than a year ago

> Looking only at BEVs, Tesla is comfortable in the lead, with 25% share, but has lost 4% share regarding the same period of last year

As now almost every manufacturer is pushing hard on EV and a lot of models are launching this year, it appears Tesla is on track to be a major player in the car industry but not necessarily dominant.",['TSLA']

n4m397,,investing,post,1620128014,"Persistent high inflation won't happenThe Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

n4wqtd,,investing,post,1620158630,"Checking my understanding of why the market portfolio is the tangency portfolio, and why market-cap-weighting is correct under MPT / CAPM(And the strong version of EMH)

Assumptions:

* There is one intergalactic market that contains *everything* of value
* The market includes a risk-free asset (though I don't believe this is truly a requirement for this conclusion)
* I can buy an infinitesimal amount of anything and everything in the market
* Everyone knows everything about everything in the market, and they've traded with such liquidity that the value of everything in the market has been determined exactly
* The market portfolio is the sum of everything in the market
* We're in a frictionless vacuum, and cows are spherical

Then, the market portfolio is the best mean/variance portfolio: if a higher Sharpe ratio portfolio existed, then *everyone* would recognize this and use it, changing the prices in the market, making the portfolio worse than or equivalent to the market portfolio.

And if I wanted to invest in the market portfolio, I would buy a fractional share of the market, the components of which would then be weighted by their value in the market (their market capitalization)

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto.

How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?  If its entire attraction is its insane volatility how is it useful for its primary purported utility—currency—when it lacks the things a currency must have, namely stable store of value and standard of value (you're going to convert it back into a government backed security at some point)?",

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?","['NKE', 'UNP', 'AAPL', 'DIS', 'NVDA', 'TGT', 'UNH', 'NFLX', 'ADBE', 'HD', 'HON', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'SPGI', 'MSFT', 'DHR', 'TMO']"

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['INTC', 'IP', 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'AMD']"

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

n3tkix,,investing,post,1620040800,"Bullish or bearish on China / FLCH?I own some FLCH, which has some 900 holdings and a quarter of the ETF is Alibaba and Tencent, however the ETF value has been stagnating. I am considering liquidating and putting my money into VTI to ride thIs wave. But this is my dilemma:

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful. I obviously regret not putting that money into VTI as my logic (at the time) was that the global recovery will be lead by China:,and since China is the biggest trading partner for some 130+ countries, the ETF will recover nicely.

Now, with political tensions (delisting included) and increasing risks of a new cold war, I'm thinking it may stagnate for the next year or so while VTI climbs. But knowing my luck I suspect that if I do so, VTI will then slow down (stimuli already priced-in) and FLCH will take off.

n3jkda,,investing,post,1620000972,"Retail Dragon Portfolio - Week 1 UpdateFirst weekly update on the Retail Dragon Portfolio. A new screenshot can be found [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/jSahhfA).

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI']

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

n44y45,gwtm292,investing,comment,1620071767,"There's a lot of regulatory / political uncertainty surrounding GEO and the prison space right now. The Biden executive order has directed the DOJ to cease use of private facilities which is acting as a headwind to revenue and contract renewal rates. Losing the Bureau of Prison business via the executive order isn't that big of a deal, but it does represent ~$290MM of revenue rolling off between now and FYE2022. More concerning, however, was having the contract with the US Marshals canceled at the GEO Queens facility as this customer was viewed as far more sticky than the BOP. Losing the BOP revenue was always a matter of ""when"", not ""if"", but potentially losing the USMS in addition means GEO investors need to diligence how the company will navigate losing two of its top three customers.

Increasing chatter of reform at ICE layers in additional concerns as this is their largest customer, though it isn't clear to me how the USMS and ICE will rapidly move away from the industry with any degree of efficiency, particularly as COVID impacts on prison and ICE populations abate. While the asset value at GEO is robust, keep in mind there is limited use for these assets. A prison can't be converted into a shopping mall or a bowling alley, for example, and at GEO you have a lot of debt ahead the equity that would be paid out first in the event of a liquidation. While it likely makes sense for the government to solve the prison prison ""problem"" by buying these assets for public use given the constraints in the government prison system, for political reasons this may not happen.

Add on top of all of this is GEO's limited ability to tap capital markets due to ESG concerns (though this is a constantly moving line) + GEO's 2024 maturity wall and it doesn't strike me as a great equity story. Limited paths for growth, regulatory concerns, questionable access to capital, refi risk, etc, etc. Eliminating the dividend was a good first step but long over due. Given yield on GEO's debt I would prefer to buy the near term bonds than the equity.

Personally I like CoreCivic better than GEO. Less leverage, better story, less BOP risk, but neither strikes me as a compelling equity opportunity.

TLDR: tough equity story; this is not a ""down the fairway"" stock as it is borderline distressed; lots of revenue is rolling off and even more is at risk of rolling off in the future rendering current P/E metrics rather useless; limited opportunities for growth in general as prison populations have been in decline for years now",['ICE']

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile.

However, I’m not even sure your statement holds today, as we can easily flip it. We say we view growth as more risky, but how many people are throwing large investments into renewables or EVs?  The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth.

Right now, I have $285,000 available to invest (The rest of my savings is for bills, other expenses, etc) and I’m hoping I can invest it so I’ll at least be able to generate some income in the meantime.

Right now, my only objective for this money is to preserve what I have while hopefully make 8-10% a year (Before inflation). From what I’ve read, this seems doable without going crazy with risk (Please correct me if I’m wrong).

From my understanding, I’d assume I should just go pick a set of diversified 5-star large-cap ETFs that have generated the returns I’m looking for and hold indefinitely, is that the correct strategy? Like I said before, I’m not looking for crazy returns, just 8-10% would be enough for my needs.

Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary.

Why not!? If you think inflation is going to keep climbing I don't see how the 30 year yield can remain low. 3% doesn't even represent a normal level of term spread even at low inflation levels. If inflation remains stable or continues to increase the 30 year yield has to continue going up just to maintain a positive expected return much less keep up with historical term spread.",

Well Powell keeps saying transitory rather than temporary because temporary implies it does away. Transitory means it is a one time bump. Once inflated the Fed and the treasury do not expect a decline in prices but lower future inflation.

I've been in gold and silver since last spring/summer. I don't think it will rise that much due to alternatives like crypto (which I sadly did not buy into last spring/summer), the strength of equities, and how bullish economies coming out of a recession tend for boom industrial materials/metals rather than defensive ones like silver/gold. Not saying it can't rise on inflation, but gold/silver are highly speculative so a strong global economy could offset the inflationary gains of precious metals.",

I have my emergency ""oh shit"" money in a very boring savings account that I can access through my bank or ATM this instant.

I have a dry powder MM fund in both my taxable brokerage and in my IRAs, and I try to maintain some cash in them to take advantage of black swan events. Last March when the pandemic hit and WTI went negative I made a big move into USL that paid off handsomely.

How much you have in long term investments vs. how much you keep as dry powder really is up to individual temperament. Dry powder may not earn you much, but might be invaluable in taking advantage of black swan events. At the same time, if those black swan events don't come, that cash may be sitting in a MM earning fuck all. 

TL;DR - I was happy to have a shitload of cash available to take advantage of shifts due to the pandemic, but now we're back to ""normal"", everyone needs to make a personal judgement on how much powder to hold in cash/MM.

It reads as a lot of wishful thinking and arrogance. Where the hell do you place Apple, the largest company in the world growing 50%?  

Growth has outperformed value for 20 years, and the winners of the dot com crash , like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, have outperformed everything by a huge margin in the last 30 years. 

Either the valuation methods were good to use and it’s just that the type of company that wins the future has so much higher margins and network effects that the definition of key value metrics has to change, OR (like many here seem to suggest), somehow this will all “regress to the mean” and somehow Sysco, public enterprise group, and Cincinnati Financial (great companies I also own) will eventually outperform the other ones I mention?

n2fchi,gwj4qzf,investing,comment,1619869196,"Someone said this in 2011 about John Hussman: ""**Conflating his views of what should happen with what could happen.** He is the anti-David Tepper, **more concerned with the the violated rules of the game than with winning the game itself**."" (https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/The-Reformed-Broker/2011/0112/Mutual-fund-manager-apologizes-kind-of) This was in 2011 after Hussman spent the prior couple of years fighting the Fed and talking about how everything was a bubble. He then spent nearly the next 10 years fighting the fed (to the point of doing a petition against what the Fed was doing - in 2020: https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/john-hussman-is-literally-fighting-the-fed/a1376170) 

I think there are people who view growth with some degree of disdain, have this belief that ""anything above (fill in random low # p/e) is bubble/overvalued/etc"" and then they get upset/frustrated when those names go up for years on end (remaining too focused on all the reasons why they shouldn't and meanwhile, not focused on why they could and did.) For all their dislike and disinterest in investing in growth, they still manage to seem to be consistent and eager spectators and have an opinion on all the most popular names. 

If you are a ""value investor"" (unless you run a value fund, I don't know why you feel you have to strictly be a ""value investor"") it's been a frustrating decade topped off with the fact that in a pandemic aggressive growth had probably its best year since the dot com era, outperforming value (which one would have thought would have provided shelter from the storm, yet underperformed in the initial decline in March 2020 and then massively underperformed in the months after.)

That said, growth can absolutely become very frothy and I think did last year - it was completely a year of ""the more aggressive the growth story the better."" The kind of performance that aggressive growth had last year was in no way sustainable unless ""this time is very different."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly)

 Ultra low rates and an eagerness to chase anything ""disruptive"" lead to a year that probably won't be repeated any time soon. People invested in EVs like all the companies were going to be winners (https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html), despite the fact that the automobile industry has a very, very, very (very) long list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) of losers in its history. People were investing in shroom stocks as if shrooms were going to be in every produce section tomorrow. Battery company that wasn't going to have a product until 2025 bought up...until reality hits (and then on top of that it's called a fraud.) I think people get overly excited about a theme and then it's buy anything related at any price. Might still actually be a good long-term theme but where you bought it still matters: if you buy into short-term mania, you could still be a bagholder for a while when reality returns. 

The Ark ""collect 'em all"" posts got excessive and people calling Cathy Wood ""Money Tree"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree) might have been the top before the correction in Feb in Ark-y aggressive growth. Many growth names corrected significantly or very significantly in Feb-Mar, and it's interesting to see what's bounced and what has not as perhaps people have become more selective. If you see another ramp higher in rates, growth will pull back again. Will ""growth collapse""? I don't think so. Will nonsense eventually crater and excess cool off? Yes. Not everything in growth is in some sort of massive, speculative excess, although people like to paint it that way.

If you're still positioned for what did exceedingly well in 2020, you're probably not going to do as well in 2021. I don't think that things are going back to 2019 normal - covid seems as if it will be endemic so I think people have to invest in this sort of ""in-between"" where it's not the worst of the pandemic but a return to 2019 or close to it might be a long ways off. I think people should consider having a portion of their portfolio dedicated to a selected group of aggressive growth names they feel strongest about and a portion dedicated to higher quality - not necessarily boring/conservative, but slower, high quality growth that has demonstrated consistent results over the years. Real assets/inflation beneficiaries should also be considered.

This isn't ""anti-value"", although I think traditional value investing I think is very difficult in a world that seems to be increasingly focused on ""why is my stock down 1% in the last hour?!?!"", it's more: understand your strengths, don't create a lot of arbitrary rules (""Anything with p/e above 15 is too expensive"") - have some flexibility and give yourself a broad mandate so that you can be able to look for the broadest set of potential opportunities.",

High valuations *are* a good reason to expect lower future returns.

That’s unlikely to repeat, and if interest rates rise, multiples will contract significantly. 

A decade ago, AAPL and MSFT *were* value stocks. People considered AAPL’s business model to be heavily reliant on the iPhone and it sold at a low P/E typical of a hardware manufacturer. MSFT was considered a dinosaur. Few were bullish on them like they are now.

1) Trends and market darlings die hard. So even if a company is overvalued, the most important aspect is that the brand is recognizable and so people are going to invest or do business with it. That means that if you buy in there is very likely to still be upswing left even if the company is somehow making all the wrong management decisions. So growth works even if you're late to the bandwagon.

2) Picking a value stock is like picking a favorite horse or home nfl draft dream team. Sure, on paper, everything may be perfectly aligned, but (repeat after me) the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. And sure P/E ratios and long views help, but you're still ultimately gambling that the crowd will eventually come to the same conclusion that you did to see any really strong uplift. And frankly, it's just hard to pick diamonds in the rough.

3) Look at any growth vs value comparison chart of the last 20 or so years and yes growth outperforms value, but they both track each other pretty well in the up markets. It's in the brief downturns where you see values greatly outperform growth, which again, I think is a logical outcome since everyone is panicking. So even though it wins the minority of the time, it wins when everyone is freaking out and so it gets this reputation as tried and true, default advice.",

Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['TWTR', 'SPGI', 'TSLA', 'DOW']"

n2uok0,,investing,post,1619913292,"İnflation nothing changedNothing has changed over the past week. The Fed remains dovish, and in spite of its transitory speak about inflation, prices continue to soar. Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

I wish I had more to say , but who wants to hear a running post on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, and given the long slow grind lower following the slingshot to 2100 in Goldand 40 silver , I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

This is why they are leading with mustangs/trucks and not Lincoln, honestly, when was the last time you saw someone under 50 willingly drive a Lincoln? The branding isn’t there.

Also Michigan is a right-to-work state and union membership has been declining because of this in recent years (or in this case, growing at a slower rate than the size of the auto industry). Some of the points you made are valid, but electrifying their truck line is a no-brainer when they were humiliated by Tesla's Cybertruck in a towing demonstration. (Argue about the validity of the Cybertruck vs F150 test until the cows come home, it was still an effective piece of marketing).

They're in the alcoholic beverages industry, own vineyards, and produce a wide portfolio of wine brands sold in 50 countries. I'm a big fan of Decoy for producing cheaply priced but great tasting reds. 

They had their IPO last month and their price seems to be stabilizing after yoyoing between $16-20. Facts:

* Market Cap: $2.1b
* Shares: $18.58
* PEG: 0.01
* **PE: 0.04**

This seems like an absolute steal. Competitors in the beverages industry have an average PE of 32.5 and PEG of 0.05 (per TD Ameritrade analytics, anyway). Its a profitable company that has great margins.

The primary downside is their tiny market share in a competitive industry. In 2020, their total revenue was $270mil, versus the industry total of $326**bil** (0.08%).

n1mz3k,gwefz00,investing,comment,1619769972,"I run 200% long 100% short.  I think using shorts to get more long is the only thing that makes sense for long term investing.  Some short sellers do tactical, shorter term trading and do well being short biased/only short.

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.  What happened late January is shorts mostly became super correlated, and things get dangerous fast.",['AAL']
n1mz3k,gwf6o1x,investing,comment,1619788281,">In bull markets, I find myself drawn to shorting highly volatile stocks because anything with decent fundamentals seems like a bad choice...but that accordingly increases the drawdowns in my portfolio

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

Invest at your own risk. The above scenario is incredibly risky and a slight deviation in your math will bankrupt your account, but if correct, it’s a big payday and scaleable with a ton of margin if you choose that risk.",
n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA. Ironically this probably sets up a good entry to short bubble stocks, of which there are plenty. Be careful of ones with weekly expiries and high short interest; these are prone to gamma manipulation by larger players. It's a game and if there is money to be made in a short squeeze it will be done. 

There is stuff like ARKK which doesn't necessarily have 0 fundamentals but has very high valuations; SPACs which are mostly frauds (e.g. NKLA), meme stocks like MVIS and GME. Go for put spreads instead of outright shorting if you can find a good entry. 

You could go for a more balanced approach and diversify your short book. Solely from valuation you can short MSFT/APPL against long GOOG/FB and I reckon there are many more interesting pairs out there. But there is so much money on the table if the bubble stocks do burst. The call-buying from retail is slowly diminishing as the economy is reopening up; interest rates are rising and I think this is probably a good opportunity to set up some shorts if you can stomach large drawdowns (and you do need conviction to believe that stocks will trade towards their fair value over time).","['ARKK', 'MSFT', 'FB', 'TSLA']"

n1i2a5,gwgp7qi,investing,comment,1619812504,"A lot of negative sentiment on TWTR in this thread. 10:1 ratio of negative comments? As expected since the stock is down +15% the last few weeks and down +25% from it's peak a few months ago. 

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']"

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.

The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",
n7l183,,StockMarket,post,1620463914,"Nine tips for reading Annual Reports by an Accountant 

Nine tips for reading Annual Reports from an Accountant. Annual reports often run into 100's of pages. Here is what you need to know.

Thread 🧵⬇️

**1. Read Back to Front.**

Miss the glossy marketing pages and skip straight to the numbers. Before reading what the managers say about how well they have done, it is a good idea to have formed our own opinion.

**2. Focus on Profit**

There are so many ways profit is calculated the directors can be talking about a completely different number to the one considered most relevant.

Check the profit adjustment items under

* Exceptional
* Non-recurring
* One-off

Decide if they should be included.

**3. Even Better Focus on Free Cashflow Over Profits**

The best investors don’t spend huge amounts of time looking at a company’s profits. Instead, they spend a lot of time looking at its free cash flow in order to work out how good or bad a company’s shares might be as an investment

What is free cash flow? In layman’s terms it is the amount of cash that a company has leftover every year to pay its lenders and shareholders. It is essentially a company’s cash profits. Or essentially the cash which can be extracted from the company, whilst the company still maintaining its current growth.

**A sign of a company with high-quality profits is that it turns a large proportion of its profits into free cash flow**

**4. Check the Segmental Report.**

When a company is changing shape, using cash flow from one division with limited prospects to build up another which will diversify and grow its revenue. The Segmental report highlights this.

**5. Check the Remuneration Report.**

This is where executive pay is disclosed. Excessive pay counts against a company in my evaluations. It can mean the board is more interested in filling its own pockets than rewarding employees and shareholders fairly.

**6. Don't Overlook the Risk Section.**

Companies do not like to talk about why they might lose money, which is what makes this section so compelling. Companies spell out the commercial challenges they face, and also present convincing arguments as to why they might overcome them.

**7. How does it make money?**

Read the business model section. A business model is how a company makes money. A strategy is how it plans to make more. To be credible, strategies must make sense, and they must be reflected in the results of the company.

**8. Skip the Chairman Notes**

Read the CFO notes. The chief financial officer will often repeat what the chief executive and chairman say but add more commentary on the numbers and how they were derived.

**9. Check Accounting Treatments**

Auditor’s report

Auditors very rarely qualify their opinion on the financial statements, but it can be useful to note which areas of accounting they focused their investigation on.

n7nbg3,,StockMarket,post,1620473509,"Bull Call Spread Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m continuing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Bull Call Spread option strategy

A Bull Call spread is a bullish strategy that is set up by buying a call option of a lower strike price while simultaneously selling a call option of a higher strike price, both being in the same expiration cycle. Take a look at the example below to see how a bull call spread looks like.

 Stock AAA is trading for $45

* Jan 18/21 Long 50 call – $1.50
* Jan 18/21 Short 53 call- $0.60

This comes out to a Net Debit of $0.90. Net debit is the total difference between what you pay and what you receive for all options in a strategy. Since a Call Debit Spread consists of 2 options, the net debit is just the difference between the premium of the long call and short call. These 2 things Net debit and Net Credit are crucial to understand as you will come across these terms frequently. 
 
For premium buying strategies, the net debit will be equivalent to max loss, the maximum amount you can lose from this trade. Meanwhile, Your maximum profit is the width of the strikes of the spread (53-50), minus the net debit. 
3-0.90= 2.10/$210. This will be the maximum amount you stand to make from this trade.

**Max profit** 

As long as the stock trades at or above the short call strike (53) at expiration, max profit is attained.  

**Max loss**

As long as the stock trades at or below the long call at expiration which is 50 in this case, you will lose the net debit paid/max loss which is $0.90 in this case

**Breakeven**

The breakeven point is found by taking the long call + net debit. If the stock trades at breakeven point at expiration, you will breakeven. If at expiration, the stock trades anywhere above the long call’s strike and below the breakeven point, you will lose money, however such losses will be lesser than max loss. If the stock trades anywhere above breakeven point but below the short call strike, you will make money. However, such profits will be lesser than max profit. 

Max profit zone: $53 and above
Max loss zone : $50 and below
Breakeven point: $50.90
Profit zone (not max profit):$50.91-$52.99
Loss zone (not max loss): $50.01-$50.89

**BULL CALL SPREAD TRADE PROFILE**

Max profit: Defined/Limited

Max loss: Defined/Limited

Optimal to use in Low IV environments

AKA Call Debit Spread

New appointed BOD member Chuck Hastings, CEO of Riley Wealth Mgmnt (Nasdaq: RILY). More major news imminent! PPS up @100% since first DD. Significant upside remains!  

Ive been super busy and haven’t chance to provide this update…

**Updated EBITDA 2021 estimate with ETH at $3500 is $55,160,000. Current Market cap is $16,384,786.**

My first extensive DD post for APLD (PPS $.92-$1.40, ETH @ $2200) link below. Current PPS approx. $1.80

APLD is a sole Ethereum Mining company. Here’s a quick recap…

&#x200B;

* Creates pure play publicly traded Ethereum mining company
* Strategic Partnership with SparkPool (the largest Ethereum mining pool in the world) and GMR will enable APLD to scale quickly with industry leading efficiency
* SparkPool and GMR each take a  9.9% equity stake in APLD and have executed a three-year services agreement with one year auto renewals
* Strong institutional backing with $16.5 million private placement
* Expects initial mining capacity to come online in May 2021
* Goal is to scale mining quickly and then expand into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-fungible tokens      (NFTs)
* The Company plans to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market as soon as possible

Link to my first DD post…

[DD: OTC MicroCap Gem. Low Float.New ETH Miner trading near/at 1x 2021 EBITDA. New Partnerships & SRVC Agreement w/Sparkpool and GMR. PPS Run just getting started...Applied Blockchain (APLD). : SpecStocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecStocks/comments/my87ps/dd_otc_microcap_gem_low_floatnew_eth_miner/)

Since my first post, the price of Ethereum has increased to $3500-$3750 from $2300ish, significantly changing the forecasted Revenue/EBITDA for 2021 and beyond (see below). This is keeping APLD a great value despite the 100% increase in PPS since my first post. IMO, ETH bull run has just gotten started. Ethereum network is the foundation for block chain. 

This is stock is still so under the radar!! But IMO that’s very close to changing. Here’s why…

1.PR is due out any day regarding the receipt and installation of their first $5m worth of mining rigs. This news will have significantly positive effect on their PPS. It will eliminate any doubts to going live with their mining rigs, etc. With the low float and typically low volume its best to buy before the news comes out.

2.APLD appointed Chuck Hastings to their board of directors. Chuck Hastings currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of B. Riley Wealth Management, a subsidiary of B. Riley Financial (Nasdaq: RILY).

“Chuck is a recognized leader in the financial industry with more than two decades of global financial and business expertise that will be of tremendous value as we pursue opportunities to leverage our initial investment and further scale our mining operations""

That means investors in all markets expect lower yields and therefore inflate prices. Now what? We sit there and we wait? Yes probably, but, what if we wanted to pull a heavy move on the market. I am an investor, speculation isn't really my thing, but the idea is in my head so I'm going to talk about it. If we concluded, by studying  and forecasting earnings growth, that the US stock market was overvalued, we could use that potential to hedge against the correction that is yet to perform. So we buy the index at high prices, sell calls (the option for people to buy the underlying asset at a stated price (strike price)) on the index we just bought, use those proceeds to buy puts and when the market corrects itself we have a leveraged return because of how options are priced. Good game, just an idea, not a speculator, but thought about it anyways :). And hey, I say it for the third time, it is just an IDEA, not advice, so no call me bad man for losing moneys. Thanks",

In your post you say you are looking to invest in corporate stock that could give you more short term returns. If you are looking for more liquid positions maybe consider dividend investing where corporations will give you earnings per share that you can either pocket or reinvest. Analysis is the biggest part though. If you do not understand technical and fundamental analysis you will not be able to enter positions with a strategy (ie entry, exit,  holding period etc) which will also affect your performance when determining the fair market value for ETFs. Investing is a long term game only. I made the mistake of learning as I went when I was 18 going through college.

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

Hello investors!

As requested, I have done a deep dive analysis into Airtel Africa, discussing both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business. This is a company that has been on my watchlist for some time, but I’ve only now got round to analysing the business in depth. 

The link to the video is above, but in summary: 

Overview:
AAF is a UK listed telecommunications company operating in 14 countries in Africa. As of September 2020, it had 116 million subscribers to its services and is growing fast. 

Risks:
Poor balance sheet - As at the most recent quarter, AAF had a current ratio of 0.6, meaning they don’t have enough current assets to cover their current liabilities, thus increasing the likelihood of raising addition capital. 

Currency risk - AAF earn their revenues and receive their cash in various African currencies, meaning depreciation in these currencies against the US dollar (their reporting currency) will negatively impact results. 

COVID-19 impact - Many African countries don’t have significant access to vaccines, meaning COVID can continue to cause problems in the short to mid term future. 

Opportunities: 
Huge total accessible market - AAF currently only operate in 14 out of 54 African countries. The logical path for growth is expansion into more countries. 

Fast growing market - Sub-Saharan Africa have the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world, forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%.

Intrinsic value calculation: 
To determine intrinsic value, I’ve used a discounted cash flow model and 10 year earnings multiple approach. Considering how conservative I’ve been with my growth numbers, the outcome is compelling. 

As always, I appreciate any time taken to read the post and watch the video. The purpose of this is to create discourse and provide a fair, balanced view from a variety of perspectives.",

n6yud3,,StockMarket,post,1620395113,"Unsolicited advice from a financial advisor for new investorsI love seeing people get excited about the stock market and investing for the first time, but it pains me to see those same people lose crazy amounts of money because they’re day trading in individual stocks they don’t actually know much about... 

The best advice I can give to young, new investors is to IGNORE the trends, and do NOT invest in individual stocks at first. 

This advice may not be exciting or sexy, and it may seem pretty vanilla, but one of the best decisions you can make as a young investor is to simply invest your money in a low-cost ETF that tracks an index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. 

The benefit of this strategy is that you’ll immediately receive diversification across multiple sectors of the economy (which is extremely important when building a portfolio), you’ll be invested in quality companies that have inherent value and aren’t just propped up by market trends, and you won’t incur the kinds of costs or capital gains taxes that come with actively managed funds. 

You may not see massive gains in the short term, and you’ll definitely see volatility, but if you want to build up as much wealth over the long-term as possible and want to have the peace of mind of knowing without a doubt that your investments will eventually recover, this is one of the best ways to get started, especially if you’re only able to invest $25 or $50 a week/month.",['SPGI']

In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium).

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

&#x200B;

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

&#x200B;

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.",['MSFT']

Allevi is a leading innovator in the bioprinting space with an exclusive focus on the research and development community. Leading laboratories leverage Allevi’s portfolio of hardware, biomaterials and software to design, engineer and build solutions for tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip research, pharmaceutical validation, biomaterial development, and regenerative medicine.

Allevi desktop 3D bioprinters are among the most versatile, powerful and easy-to-use bioprinters on the market. Customers also have access to a wide range of biomaterials—bioinks, bioink additives, cells, reagents and consumables—as well as an intuitive software interface.

In the medical field, 3D Sytems has delivered additive manufacturing solutions to the healthcare community for more than 30 years. Having produced more than 2,000,000 serial component medical devices and 140,000 patient-specific surgical cases, the company is now scaling the production of bioprinted clinical applications. This technology will elevate patient care through various clinical applications ranging from acellular bioresorbable devices to functionalized solid organs for transplantation.

Before bioprinter hardware manufacturer Allevi, 3D Systems had already entered the bioprinting services market. Together with United Therapeutics Corporation and its organ manufacturing and transplantation-focused subsidiary, Lung Biotechnology PBC, the company achieved significant progress in the development of next-generation bioprinting solutions for lung scaffolds that are capable of full size, vascularized, rapid, micron-level printing.
3D Systems’ capabilities as a technology innovator, spanning hardware, software, and materials science, combined with United Therapeutics’ renowned expertise in regenerative medicine has enabled advances in lung modeling, 3D printing, as well as material formulation and material handling to yield significant capabilities in bioprinters and biomaterials for the eventual production of transplantable organs.
To meet the evolving needs of the clinical and R&D communities, 3D Systems continues to push technologies to facilitate advanced application development. The Print to Perfusion process enables 3D printing of high-resolution scaffolds, which can be perfused with living cells to create tissues.
The ability to print large, vascularized, highly detailed hydrogel scaffolds at rapid speeds is opening new opportunities for a range of tissue applications. In addition, we are developing bioprinting solutions that are both commercially viable and scalable from prototype to production.

I read somewhere that 70 % of new retail clients on trading apps loose money. Its really hard to make a profit as the  market it seems is so manipulated by the big players these days. I suggest you also check out the biggest winners and loosers in the stock market daily. Do some research as to why they went up and down.

I've 10 yrs of wall st experience (research analyst / market structure). I feel a lot of your pain with the sell-off in growth names. It's definitely craziest market environments I've seen.

Here's some practical concepts and tactics to help (I will also be reviewing my portfolio over the next few days with the same plan).

**TLDR: Investing = change, Basics of business model, Estimate valuation.**

My plan is to share what I've learned into a step-by-step book. If interested, I'd love your [feedback here](https://forms.gle/RyycWAxNRsGZSxwTA) (2 minutes!). Here is the [outline of the book.](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) (Or leave a comment!) Get in on the [pre-sale!](https://gum.co/czkJr)\*

**Investing = change.** A basic reminder that we buy shares of businesses that will be worth more in the future. There is some change happening and the business will have higher future finances. The fun (and painful) part is using a thesis (expectations) and matching it with your risk tolerance and goals.

I am fairly confident ecommerce will grow in SE Asia and the $SE founder will execute. And also I am willing still willing to bet that banks will want to use A.I. type credit decisioning with $UPST.

Focus on the change - the y/y % growth in the future - and the future valuation of the business.

*$RKT is perfect example of this. The guidance for 2Q21 loan volumes is 14%, which is a huge slowing from the 100+% y/y rate in 1Q21. Earning estimates are coming down for '22/23, especially since everyone knows their business declined in '17-18 and '13-14 with rate hikes. So the stock continues to be sold off.*

*And it works in the opposite way too! if rates decline and loan volumes increase 21/'22 (more than expected), estimates will likely go up and the stock will too!*

**Understand business model.** Also the basics -simplify the company to a way that you can estimate its future value. What is the value of its product and service to customers, what type of market is it in? What is management's vision - particularly its strategy to grow and the source of profits?

You can get these from MD&A sections in 10Ks, investor presentations, and videos with management.

For example, I've learned that $PLBY new management plans expand licensing into several consumer product areas, where the value to customers is the brand assets. And also the $DMTK product value is a non-invasive test which is supposed to more economical and the growth will come from insurance coverage. This leads to...

**Estimate future valuation.** Businesses are valued on future growth (size in the future) and the future cash flows they will generate. The basic high-level steps to get there:

*Unit economics /revenue* \- estimate the volume and price of products / services over the next few years. For example, tests / transactions and $ per unit, to get revenues.

*Estimate the margin* \- what are the expenses to get there, and more importantly, what can be ""leveraged"" i.e. have more sales per $ of costs. For example, higher prices per unit usually creates higher gross margins. This gets you earnings (which over-time, equals cash flows).

*Estimate balance sheet use* \- capital will be needed to expand the business. This is ""capex"" or ""R&D"" or similar for innovative companies. Negative earnings also means cash will be used.

*Estimate capital raises.* This means debt (increases financial ""leverage"" or change in earnings with revenues, both ways, and also bankruptcy risk), or from equity (which dilutes your share).

*Estimate value* \- A tool for this is ""multiples"" off forward metrics. For example, enterprise value (EV) / next twelve months (NTM) sales. EV / NTM EBITDA and P/E are popular for earnings.

Find peers (similar business model, space and financial profile). You can use proxy peers or similar analyst coverage. Take their multiples and apply it to your estimated future sales or earnings.

**Now you have an estimate of where the stock can go.** Make sure to discount it back (say 10%) each year which is your required level of return for holding stocks. Have this to manage your idea.

Happy investing everyone!!!

n6wwjh,gx9lpsv,StockMarket,comment,1620390960,"A few things happening right now...

-many speculative stocks were in a ‘bubble’ and have/are crashing. They had crazy valuations and many, maybe even most, had no profits. Valued solely on their sales and sky high they’ve seen a crash down like 50%. 

-at the same time this fear has moved that money to ‘value’ stocks. Mainly the traditional financial sector, energy, and utilities. And here we go again! Up goes companies stock that in many cases are also not supported by financial success. 

-the fed is printing money and handing it out. This feeds the economy in theory and worked back 2008 but we’ll see what affect it has now. 

-Biden admin is doing some policy stuff that freaks people out. Tax those cap gains on millionaires, waiving pharmaceutical patents, plans to raise min wage, etc. Every time they have a press conference something freaks people out and a little dip of 1-3% seems to happen. Short lived though. 

-big tech and profitable ‘growth’ companies are flat. They are not in a bubble. With slight high valuations compared to past, they still are projected to double or more in 5 years when equalized to avg valuations. So just like every past bubble, the smart buys are on companies that produce continual cash growth. Learn how to value companies and estimate growth and you can be confident in what you purchase.",

My return is presently positive.

I'd like to sell right now, and reinvest after it tanks, if it does. But the problem is, I'm not confident that it's going to tank as badly as the short term capital gains taxes I'd pay (my returns have been like 80% on one of them)

In other words, Im going to lose roughly 30% in taxes if I sell. I don't believe that it's going to tank badly enough for me to lose as much as I will if I sell.

So, what finally, what I'm wondering is if there's some sort of system I can use to pull the money out of the stocks, but not he able to use it, and not pay taxes on it. Obviously it has to be legal.

I am currently looking to manage a fund with my friends & family about 7 people total. I am interested in buying 2/3 different stocks with the money each investor contributes, myself included, and then I would execute the trades in the group account with the money that was contributed. I currently keep track of all investments by hand on the computer but as we grow, I wanted a more streamlined approach.

Is there an app or website that can track investor percentage based on how much money party “A” has put into the fund? I have 6 members currently and I’ve been doing the math by hand and keeping track of the stock price when I make the purchase for each member. But I wanted to know if there was a more streamlined approach to managing the current equity of the group, investor ownership percentage, current market worth of each investor within the group based on percentage of group ownership dependent on when their portion bought-in to a certain security and how much they contributed.

TL;DR is there a build-your-own mutual fund app or website that I could use?

n6gxmv,,StockMarket,post,1620333220,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 6, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

n70680,,StockMarket,post,1620398756,"Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has increased by almost 3%.The price of ZKIN shares has successfully broke from the falling wedge bullish pattern to the upside with a local top at $5.50 per share.

This breakout has failed to sustain and immediately tested support at $5.20 where it has attracted buyers and once again immediately tested $5.40 area.

Currently the price of ZKIN is still giving the resistance at $5.40 some hard time. It's not important now to break above this value, rather stay above it and confirm $5.40 as a support.

Confirming $5.40 as a support would change the overall short term downtrend into a long awaited uptrend.

The overall trend remains still a downtrend, hovering above $5.40 can easily change this trend.

Still this is just an oversold bounce, but considering it's coming from a bullish pattern which sometimes changes the trend, it's likely to get changed.

Current resistance is now at $5.40 and support at $5.20.

RSI is in a clear trend of higher highs and lows. A break above 60 is necessary in order to see another move to the upside, that could reach the price of $5.60 with spikes higher.

MACD is in a long buying wave. A corrective wave is expected soon as this buying wave is pretty overextended.

In conclusion, the short term signals are pretty neutral, with a lack of clear direction for now.",

YuyuCat is programmed to reward holders and built on transparency and trust

Anti-rug pulls
Liquidity is automatically accumulated per every token transfer. Every token transfer has a liquidity fee of 5% of the transferred token amount. The fee is added to the liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. This allows liquidity pools to increase by every transaction, thus enabling anti-rug pulls.


RFI Static Rewards System
Every transaction has 5% of the transferred token amount. The fee is redistributed to all token holders automatically as long as the users hold YUYUCAT. This means users' token balances grow gradually over time, thus earning passive income in their wallets over time.


100% Community Driven
Community driven & ultra-fair launch. Devs have no pre-mined tokens. All tokens are added to PancakeSwap for initial liquidity and every one must buy YUYUCAT from PancakeSwap pairs.

n6ewtr,gx84z9v,StockMarket,comment,1620352585,"You're buying too many high-risk/high-reward things.

These ARK funds are often companies that aren't turning a profit yet or have just started to, and many believe in the near future. They aren't making enough money to justify the price it is now, but they might be in 3-4 years.

What happens is the moment something small increases the risk they don't, they go down faster than everything else.

A company that is and has been turning a profit and the company's stock price is no more than $15-$35 their earnings will stay relatively stable, but generally grows more gradually. These are safer investments.

&#x200B;

VTI is good. It is a market ETF, but the problem is it is way too small in your portfolio. You have to get that balance between riskier stocks and non-risky stocks. ARK ETFs+risky tech stocks are typically no more than 5-10% of my portfolio when bought alone. My index funds are already buying small amounts of those companies, so I'm really 10-15% into riskier high-growth assetts.

Then I want safer growth assets that take some risk. AMD is a good example of this actually, Taiwan Semiconductor probably is too. They are tech based, but they have profits now to warrant their pricing with room to grow. The current P/E ratio is $33.06. That means for every $1 annually AMD earns in profits now, it costs $33.06 to own that share. This is an example of something that is slightly above average risky, but isn't that bad.

My portfolio, collectively, has 20-30% in this level of risk. Beyond that I'm in market index funds and I am also buying value stock. These are companies that have long sense made it. There isn't much room for growth, but they have a stable product that is making consistent money. They keep operating their stock goes up at a slower rate and they give stockholders dividends between 1%-7%, depending on the situation and other metrics. These types of stocks usually have a P/E ratio in the lower range $12-$20.

Learn to balance the risk, but take risk in a portion of your portfolio.",['AMD']

n6s5av,,StockMarket,post,1620369161,"Thoughts: Prepare for rotation out of pandemic stocks?Just a random thought. A lot of companies that were seen as a safe haven during the pandemic (online companies, technology, healthcare...whatever people thought would be more COVID proof, as well as COVID recovery plays, cryptos, resources) are most likely overbought right now.

It’s probably still a ways out, but I would imagine that if those are your whole portfolio it would be a good time to start rethinking that.

There are two possible scenarios here, either COVID and pandemics in general just become a fact of life or we get to a point of mass vaccination.

Either way, when that shift happens and the economy goes back to normal it will probably be a bad idea to keep holding all of those.

I’d imagine there would be a rotation out of them because they have no room left to keep running and because there will be bigger growth opportunities in companies hit hard by COVID when they start beating the low earnings expectations that were set during the pandemic.

Using the science of guesstimation I’d think some of those sectors are due for a 40% to 50% drop once the whole pandemic settles and investors start to go back to old patterns which will probably trigger some panic selling and cause a smaller market crash that only affects certain industries.

It’s just something on my mind I felt like sharing. It’s probably a ways off but I’m thinking it would be something to be aware of.

The company generated revenues of $84.9 million (35% YoY) vs. $85.1 million market consensus. Net loss per share was $0.12 vs. an expected $0.11.

These are not big misses but make the company one of the few high-growth cloud players that underperformed market expectations.

However, the company also lowered its guidance for Q2: Fastly forecasts revenues of $84 - $87 million and a net loss of $0.16 - $0.19 per share, compared to the market consensus of $92 million in revenue and a net loss of $0.08 per share, thereby disappointing investors.

Lastly, Adriel Lares will step down as CFO of the company after 5 years.

[***Chris Lange***](https://247wallst.com/author/chris-lange/)***May 4, 2021 11:53 pm***

One ARK exchange-traded fund run by ETF star Cathie Wood bought over 1.5 million shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. ([**NYSE: PLTR**](https://247wallst.com/companies/pltr/)) shares on Tuesday, as the prices of this ETF traded down over 3% in Tuesday’s session. The ETF is up well over 100% in the last year.

ARK Innovation ETF ([**NYSEARCA: ARKK**](https://247wallst.com/companies/arkk/)) bought 1,514,080 shares of Palantir. At Tuesday’s closing price this would have valued this purchase at roughly $32.8 million. This is only a small fraction of the total holdings. ARKK is up 112% over the past 52 weeks.

24/7 Wall St. [**recently reported on Palantir**](https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2021/02/18/goldman-sachs-raises-price-targets-on-sizzling-momentum-tech-stocks/):

>This company came public as a direct listing and struggled out of the gate, but the stock seems to be taking off now. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) builds and deploys software platforms for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations.  
The company offers Palantir Gotham, a software platform for government operatives in the defense and intelligence sectors, which enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals to intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, as well as facilitates the handoff between analysts and operational users, helping operators plan and execute real-world responses to threats that have been identified within the platform.  
The company also provides Palantir Foundry, a platform that transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data, and it allows individual users to integrate and analyze the data they need in one place.

### This is not a legitimate reddit user!

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *Scammer:* **EddieGriffin5665**
* *This Post:* [super cute](https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n75e9v/super_cute/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

---

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

n6wmqa,,StockMarket,post,1620388097,"What can a company do to avoid sinking along with the country?Okay so this might seem like an out of the blue question.

Today, the United States hosts by far the best and most well established companies worldwide.

I'm optimistic about the future of these companies. However, I can't say the same regarding the United States as a whole.

Let's say that, hypothetically, the US were to gradually sink, decline, collapse (whatever you want to call it).

What can these big companies do to avoid sinking along with the country that hosts them? Do they have tools? better chances for survival? or is it game over for them?

I really like the companies that I invest in (after days or even weeks of research, of course.)

But there's this little issue that bugs me every time I invest in US stocks, and it's that I feel like the US has already reached it's peak, and I don't know what the future holds for this country given all these obstacles that they brought upon themselves.. (currency inflation, rising global competition by Asia, gigantic national debt, defecits, political polarization.. just to name a few).

I know there's probably no better alternative, but this issue is preventing me from investing a larger sum of money.

Feel free to discuss whatever topic that's related to the question. Cheers!",

n6wmqa,gx9obnc,StockMarket,comment,1620392383,"I’d frankly be more concerned about the giant economic bubble China has created than the US reaching “gigantic national debt.” China’s currency situation is far more dire than America’s. They’ve devalued the Yuan to prop up an economy built on fake and structurally unsound growth.

The USSR also had fast industrialization with currency manipulation. They also had a secretive communist dictatorship that falsely propped up an economy. Nothing in history is an exact repeat, but I wouldn’t count on China to supplant the United States based on falsified data and unrealistic growth.

Also, America has had periods of political unrest before: civil rights era, the Great Depression, the blundering generation.

So I am a teenager and have been into the stock market for quite a while now. I have lately made quite a lot of money from cripto, and since I understand they are very risky and volatile, I was wondering if i should invest the money that I made into an index fund. 
I know index funds are a very safe investment long term, and that’s what i’m looking for, however, I am worried that due to the amount of money that the federal reserve printed to combat the covid economic crisis, the S&P 500 will crash soon because of inflation.

$RKT - Everyone is building houses 🏠 in 2021 with premium lumbers 🪵 and everyone loves using TurboTax. That’s why you should invest in Quickbooks Mortgages 🧾. Plus their name is an emoji we like 🚀. Buy calls.

$MVIS - it’s a microchip 💾 company or uh...a laser 🔫 company. It’s really good. It’s been around for 20 years without making a profit so it’s sure to profit on year 21. Buy calls and shares and maybe puts too.

$ROOT - Insurance company that makes you install an app on your phone and raises your rates if you speed 🚗. Everyone likes driving slow 🚧, switching insurance providers 👨🏻‍💼, and learning new apps 📱. Switch to ROOT insurance, drive safe, save money, reinvest those dividents into ROOT.

$PTON - They make execise bikes 🚲 that require a monthly subscription 💳. Will continue to soar after gyms reopen. Only killed ☠️ one baby 👶🏻, which is a limitless resource and we can always make more. Massive product recalls are an opportunity to wow customers with premium service. Buy at any price under $200.

$CLOV - owned by benevolent billionaire 💰 Chana 🥘 Masala, Clover uses machine learning 🤖 to decide when it’s time for your parents to die ☠️. Chana even bought $GME once. Buy leaps! 6/18 $20c. 7/17 $25c. 8/19 $30c. 9/20 $40c. 10/31 $100c.

$ARKK - owned by Christian ✝️ MILF 🤵🏻‍♀️ Cathy “Gives Me” Wood 🪵 It’s an ETF that buys all the WSB tickers, cause Cathy is trying to impress us 🦍. If you want to diversify put your life’s savings into this one. Buy 6/18 $200c.

$PLTR - owned by a gay 🌈 Paypal vampire 🧛🏻‍♂️. They sell Palastinian 🇵🇸 address data to the IDF 🇮🇱 Palintir is Sauromon’s crystal ball 🔮, and Sauromon was the good guy in $LOTR. Too risky for calls because share price only goes down so buy shares, any price under $60 is good.

$TSLA - Owned by the other 🌈 Paypal guy, this company sells electric ⚡️ cars 🚙 at a loss 📉 and they just bought a ton of electric coins at -10% ATH. Run by the Smartest man on the planet. Buy $2000c. on Monday cause Elon on SNL is gonna print! 🖨

And of course, the big one,

$GME - a video game 🎮 pawnshop that will soon let you pawn boardgames 🎲 and computers 💻. It is exactly what Americans need in the 2020s. Buy $800c every month.

Make sure to NEVER take profit. Only sell on a loss. The point of the market isn’t to make money, it’s to impress a message board by losing a year’s salary in a screenshot 🤳🏻.

n7um6w,,wallstreetbets,post,1620496439,"CLOV will be a multi-baggerI'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)

Below is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):

1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let’s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) – a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover’s business model is so fool proof!***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***
2. **Competition:** Now let’s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***
3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover’s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***
4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let’s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this…as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn’t….60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover’s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***
5. **Customers:** Let’s now put some light on the target demographic…seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.
6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance…except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money…now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.
7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock – he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as board member and dem access. Recently they added the former director of Medicare - literally the only possible guy in the world that can get them what they need to continue growth for years to come.**
8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \~$3B, which is \~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover’s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated…upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond….it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space – TDOC – and a Cathie Wood & ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***

I am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.

CLOV YOLO

&#x200B;

**Edit 1:** as someone correctly pointed out below, heavy investors such as Vanguard, Blackrock and Bailee Gifford (Tesla mega bulls) all bought in at a mid $8 price point.

**Edit 2:** as requested below, there is also a bear case which simply means CLOV might take time to realize its full potential...which is different than saying it will go into the ground.   
**B1. Competition:** new competitors trying to enter the fast growing (but boring) MA market with an advanced tech platform ala Clover Assistant could impact growth rate (not growth). I think its highly unlikely but possible specially when Biden announces lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Smaller companies might want to get in on the gold rush. And legacy companies may want to invest heavily into revamping their business model (UNLIKELY - why? read [The Innovators Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-audiobook/dp/B06Y4RRGVV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7diEBhB-EiwAskVi11l5HeOM_5nz4Z9EMKJHbGR9bSEs5YenWuxP8ykS-TP5AKJo1UhP1hoCiTkQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241921991729&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1018704&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3239668408352121876&hvtargid=kwd-59432786&hydadcr=24632_10399692&keywords=the+innovators+dilemma&qid=1620501116&sr=8-1))  
**B2: Management:** management churn might impact the vision on which this company was founded. Vivek is a visionary - but the short report, legal challenges, DOJ inquiries, can impact his and his teams performance though the upcoming ER should lay to rest any such doubts.

https://preview.redd.it/0vfuohmplrx61.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ec4444fbbf936dcac53ffdca7f5f0d530789e1

Let's get some facts straight, because it hurts me to see how all of you amateurs are being played by the master poker players of Wall Street.

# Real Estate prices

Home prices are hitting record highs. Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.

# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too

Ummm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?

# Dividend

I know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that your dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:

* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield

Basically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *""don't buy a stock just for the dividend""*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

Fun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.

# Russell Index

Remember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?

Well the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for consideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.

# Bluffing

The definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - ""*What if my stock goes to zero?*"" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:

* **We covered on GME** \- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!
* **AMC is going bankrupt** \- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!
* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \- Are you gonna fall for it again?

# Mathematical pressure

You see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.

At some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.

You wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.

Somebody mentioned SKLZ and last time I lost shorting it bcs of Cathie buying 2m of it in a day.

Looking more into it since she's been adding very heavily over the past few days, like insanely heavy. Cathie's holdings as of last night.

SKLZ = 8.2M (ARKW) + 12.8M (ARKK) = 21M. Shares float = 149.42M. % of float = 14%. Short % float = 30.34%

Other comparison is TDOC = 4M (ARKG) + 1.8M (ARKW) + 8.5M (ARKK) =14.3M. Shares Float = 153M. % of float = 9.34%. Short % Float = 11%

Cathie's trying to short squeeze SKLZ or something. borrow fee is 4.6% so probably not yet.

Choppy week upcoming with lots of growth earnings so I'd like to wait for that upside confirmation before making a play. If Cathie keeps buying this week it might break the 17 mark easily. At 14% shares float ownership it might be the highest percentage wise of ark holdings I've ever seen.

Edit: also adding that with 1m+ purchases a day she represents around 5% of daily trading volume recently","['MMM', 'ARKK']"

I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to stocks and I've only been doing this for like a couple months. I am not a financial advisor or professional. What I am is a physician with at least some literacy, though not expertise, in oncology. In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training. Without further ado...I present my first DD:

I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron\_rgen\_is\_rumored\_to\_be\_buying\_out\_ino/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron_rgen_is_rumored_to_be_buying_out_ino/)). The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had ""MD"" in it so it caught my attention...but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC (epic is the #1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar) and anyone asking that probably 1) is actually a doctor and 2) doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate...the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician...not much unlike the famous Dr. Burry

That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to ""do my own DD"" as they say. Now I am not 100% sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that  I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well (ok just a little well), right?

Background

I open the patent application and read up on it. My first impression? Lol you can't treat GBM. For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma)) that is one of the few ""death sentences"" that exist in medicine. I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch. Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this. Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much. Patients die within a year basically 100% of the time even with advances such as ""gamma knife"" radiation. I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable. But then I read more about their tech and the patent and....wait a second this actually sounds legit. So now to break down some of the science behind this....

Methods

INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes. To put it in non-doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain. Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment) due to what is called the blood brain barrier. Your brain is (reasonably so) walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there. Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either. In particular the medicine they have developed (INO 5401) is a PD-1 inhibitor, but delivered into the brain. As soon as I saw PD-1 this peaked my interest hard. anti PD-1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that ""uncloak"" cancer from hiding from your immune system. The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab)) which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma. The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug. That's where INO comes in with their patented tech.

Results

Go to the patent link above and click ""images"". This is the money shot. MRI on left = v bad cancer. MRI on the right = cancer is dead. What. Yep. Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution. Mind blowing. Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD-1 inhibitors is varied. Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS. I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away...but only in some patients. I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured. Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment. Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro-oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously? Google her.

Conclusion

Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money? I go look up the study. This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective (phase 1 = is the drug safe, phase 2 = does the drug work...did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies?). I saunter over to clinical[trials.gov](https://trials.gov) (the federal website where all clinical trials are listed) and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021. The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol...meaning they have 99% of their data and the study is essentially complete. I then saunter over to [google.com](https://google.com) (the worlds largest search engine) and look for other data they have. Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html)). ""Overall survival"" and ""Progression free survival"" are the holy grails of results in cancer research. The fact that they have 80% progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing. I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent. But again ... how is it that this is gonna moon soon? Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences. [https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc\_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf). Dates: May 12, May 18. Not just a one tiered moon shot, but a two tiered moon shot! 

Discussion

In conclusion: their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug, to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent. Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings. I don't know what I'm more excited about...a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon. I like the stock. I like the tech. I like the implications to cancer treatment.

Disclosures: No affiliation with any of the above companies. I bought lots calls as well as stock this morning. I have no idea what I'm doing. In fact if anyone wants to tell me how to make money from this information please let me know.",['GOOGL']

According to FINTEL, Blackrock recently bought 2,078,899 shares. 

https://fintel.io/so/us/clov

Scroll down to the 13 F filings.

I will first say that I am NEW to trading so take my opinion cautiously and do your own DD. I am NEW compared to the 100 year old WSB OGs. This is my disclaimer.

I am not confident enough to write DD but Im working on it. One thing I do know is whenever I follow Blackrocks moves, I make green sometimes sooner sometimes later. Blackrock is SMART MONEY, so I am drawn to their moves for validation. Blackrock usually plays a long game to sell when they are comfortable with the profit margin; this is not exactly breaking news. I was first hesitant with CLOV because of the legal investigation but that appears to be losing muster.

I have $10 Calls and $11 Calls for 06/18 and will start adding shares on Monday . I am looking at Jan 2022 CALLS to give me longer term perspective on this stock.

The SI % of float has reached 43.48%

n7jxln,gxelwnt,wallstreetbets,comment,1620493924,The 2 sharp drops are the result of margin calls and stop losses run wild. That's all robot trading at its best. All the regulations following 1929 were quietly dismantled in the last few decades and this is a back to the future where 19th century bubbles and bursts are about to get digital postal. And what happened here is a prime example. That aside no one will sell if they are an institution and saw a sudden 80% drop. At this point write off the loss at 100% and wait. And a ton of newcomers will come in so I think 15-20 short term is a fair assessment and back to 40-50 once the smoke from the disinformation clears. A sound management will also address this issue next week and I expect some major PR to step in.

INFLATION IS HERE

So far the $10s of trillions of printed money has not translated into inflation in official consumer prices.

But we are now seeing major inflation in commodity prices.

If we just look at food commodity prices, they are up 54% since July 2020.

And if we look at general commodity prices – up 89% since April 2020 – they are telling us that high inflation  is not far away.


Dow gold ratio 

Even though gold has yielded an excellent return, it is what happens to the Dow/Gold ratio in the future that determines if investors should stay with stocks or hold gold.

Gold bottomed at $250 in 1999 as the ratio peaked at 45. The ratio subsequently fell to 5 in 2011 and corrected from there to 22.5 in 2018.

Since 2018, the Dow/Gold downtrend has resumed. The indicator at the bottom of the chart is the quarterly MACD which is a very important indication of the long term trend. The MACD turned down in 2019 for the first time since the 1999 top. This is a very strong sign that Dow/Gold has now resumed the long term downtrend.

If we then look at the long term picture of the Dow/Gold ratio, it gives us a very good idea of where we are heading.

2021 expectation 

We have tried to break 1800 in Gold and 27.2 in silver on at least 4 occasions and we’re trying again as I post . It’s safe to say that when this level breaks, one should expect a sharp rise higher.

The latest attempt 2 days ago was undermined by a nonsensical comment from Yellen:

""May need rate hikes to stop the economy from overheating.""

This had the effect of causing Gold to dump from 1800 and today again over 1800

Damage done, Yellen quickly recanted her statement:

“Let me be clear it’s not something Nobody’s predicting or recommending.”

Then why say it?

Gold put a double bottom in place at 1770 and silver 26.5 and then head back up to resistance again:

Unless we get some new algo triggering news, it looks like a break of 1800 in gold and 30 in silver is imminent. We keep testing that 1800 level and more frequently now, which signals it impending demise as a resistance level.

For silver my opinion is clear and Uber bullish and 
I would not be surprised  to see the 1980 and 2011 $50 high up to $80  to be taken out in 2021. 

I wish I had more to say this post , but who wants to hear a running commentary on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",['DOW']

I just listened to [two podcasts](https://youtu.be/chE2OEToxOg) where the ex-market maker JJ Gorilla u/vwaptrader1 tells it from the other side.

  
As retail traders, we have to admit that we chase price, but we should learn from our mistakes as quickly as possible. One way to do that is to learn the mechanics and business of doing a deal.

In episode 187, JJ goes on to say why he feels the $GME action wasn't all business and more needs to be considered to what is going on from those who hold the stock and how impressed he was with r/wallstreetbets. From what I took from the convo, in essence, he has a gut feeling that someone is using the hype to get out of GME and he's looking to the management.

What was even more interesting to me was the way he talks about Supply and the order of events in which the Business gets done.  As he explained that Supply is the key to everything and how a market maker's job is to facilitate those that need to sell their supply of stock/securities/assets etc. and to provide liquidity to those traders looking to buy up to that Supply.

The Gap and Trap move he describes in the podcast played out to the letter yesterday in the Nasdaq, so I have no reason not to look more into what this ex-market maker has to say.

And here's where we are **(LOSERS IN BOLD;** *N/A, draws, or otherwise flat trades in italics)***:**

&#x200B;

1. **$CLNE:  This one got ugly.  Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**
2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*
3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and ""feeling pain"", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.
4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**
5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.
6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed
7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*
8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed
9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO
10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO
11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**
12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.
13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**
14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet
15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**

&#x200B;

# The shorts:

1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish.  Related note:  Think I've finally got a grasp on this one - 6 successful trades in a row, and I was even able to call the closing bell price within less than a dollar this morning.  This stock is finally starting to play by the rules.
2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.
3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out
4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*
5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.
6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again
7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*
8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.
9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**
10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall
11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*
12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it
13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story
14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop
15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.
16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding.
17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath
18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*
19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95
20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop
21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.
22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*
23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*
24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live
25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it
26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*
27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  They treated me like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me just like that dude who wanted to fuck a pig.**
28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*

&#x200B;

Wild card:  Scalped some nice puts on Brooklyn Pharm.  But any idiot could have done that.

Unexpected long:  Entered into $ON again with 1500 October 45c's and 300 1/22 45c's.  The price was just too good.

**Record after 1 week:**

&#x200B;

* *Longs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)*
* *Shorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.  Take out the trades where I never expended powder and it's 18-2-2.*

# 

# Overall (played trades):  26-7-2

# Advanced Metric - New trades that don't involve positions I've had open at least 3 months:  26-3-2

n78k7o,,wallstreetbets,post,1620420451,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - May 3rd to May 7thWhat’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season continues, led by the many hyper growth stocks within the market. Like last week, there was a fat bag to be made, so I hope you all did well! This week is shorter than most, as not much has happened aside from companies reporting earnings. Let’s get into the news.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, legendary investor Warren Buffet spoke at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting**, and it was honestly a banger. There was lot’s to be learned alongside the many cool topics which were discussed. My personal favourite was when they touched upon how most people were using the stock market as an exaggerated version of gambling. Although he;s not wrong, I wasn’t really in the mood to get personally attacked by a mf who looks like he’s on his deathbed. Regardless, if you would like a TLDR of the conference, you can find a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx-OzwHpM9k) and if you’d like a video link, you can find one [here](https://www.investopedia.com/5-takeaways-from-the-2021-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting-and-quarterly-earnings-report-5181664).

&nbsp;


- **Early in the week, Janet Yellen decided to play chicken with the market by suggesting that a rate increase may happen sooner, rather than later**. The markets swiftly tanked as a result, and in the end Janet Yellen ended up taking back what she said a day later. Obviously the economy is in shambles, but as long as nobody brings it up, we can keep the music playing, and the good times coming. Rookie mistake from Yellen, I’m sure it won’t happen again.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, I ended up blowing up my account, which is pretty cool considering both Bill Gates and I managed to lose half of our net worth on the same day**. To the shock of many, after a long 27 years together, Bill and his wife Melinda decided to call it quits. Kudos to them for making it work for so long, I know the decision couldn't have been easy for either one of them. Both parties have asked for space and privacy during this time, so I plan on waiting till next week before sliding into the DMs.

&nbsp;


- **On Friday, the monthly job report was released, and it was kind of dogshit**. Nonfarm payrolls were expected to rise by roughly 1,000,000, but instead, we were met with a measly 266,000. We literally missed the projection by 75%. As a result of this absolute fucking disaster, the unemployment rate raised to 6%. I’m pretty sure there were more jobs being created when we were balls deep in the pandemic last March. Normally, shit news like this would be viewed as such, but in this clown market, this was viewed as bullish instead, so stocks rallied 1% on the day, creating new ATHs for all of the indices.

&nbsp;


- **As far as earnings are concerned, I’m too lazy to cover all 60 companies so I’m not going to**. That being said, almost every single company put up a *strong* beat aside from $RKT (lmao), indicating strength in the markets. Unfortunately, almost every single earnings beat was priced in, leading to most stocks tanking post earnings. This made it pretty easy to trade on earnings days, so if you somehow managed to lose money this week you should be ashamed of yourself. If you need some assistance playing earnings, I’ll likely post a master spreadsheet to both Reddit and Discord on Sunday to help you all out.

&nbsp;


- **Although dicey, the major indices closed the week out strong!** The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial average each made new respective all-time highs today despite the biggest miss in non-farm payrolls since at least 1998. Despite the insane mid-week chop brought on by Yellen, we’re still on pace for SPY to reach 450 during the summer, and 500 by EOY. Bullish as fuck. Both tech and growth stocks took an absolute beating this week, while energy, financials, and value stocks finally had the chance to soak up some gains. I hope next week is just as green, and just as choppy.


&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! I hope you all had an awesome week, and made a fat stack of cash. If you would like a copy of these newspapers in advance, feel free to check out the Discord! I hope you all get to enjoy the nice weather and have a wonderful weekend! I’ll catch you all at the casino come Monday. Cheers 😎","['SPGI', 'DOW', 'BRK.B']"

n7cyab,,wallstreetbets,post,1620433051,"PTON’s push to become a green companyPeloton Interactive (PTON) is a company that, among other products, produced treadmills that have seen attention in the news cycle recently. 

On March 18, after market close, it was reported that [PTON’s treadmill had killed a child.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-ceo-says-child-died-in-treadmill-accident-11616093799)  Let me preface this by saying that this was by any account a tragic occurrence, but let’s talk about the stocks reaction to this:

As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZsaXN7M), between March 18 and March 19, the stock went from $102.74 to $108.31, a 5.4% increase in price.  Extrapolating from this data, we can see clearly that if they left their treadmills in operation, and they ate about 20 more children, 20*5%=100%, then the stock price would double.  The reason for the rise in stock price refers back to the theory of overpopulation, the treadmills clearly were made to help counteract in an effort to become a green company, which would allow them to receive government tax credits.  All companies with a decent profit margin kill kids, like Nestle, Monsanto, or Berkshire Hathaway.

These first time millennial parents are peloton's target audience, baby eating was obviously built in as a feature, but they decided to complain about “ethics” and “human decency.”  This caused PTON to recall their treadmills, ultimately undermining their bottom line.

Although they will no longer be a green company eligible for tax benefits, more bullish news comes in light of the recall.   We need to realize that just like high unemployment numbers are bullish for the economy, a large profit loss is very bullish for a stock.  [PTON is going to lose $165 million due to this recall](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/06/business/peloton-recall-losses/index.html), which is very bullish for the stock.",['BRK.B']

n75osi,,wallstreetbets,post,1620412954,"Expanding the DD on $INO (tl;dr it went down because it is massively shorted for no reason)So I just read [this very interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n70cim/my_first_dd_im_a_doctor_and_i_think_ino_is_about/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and I went on to see what I could about $INO.

Thing is, despite all of OP’s arguments being totally true (company being releasing cutting-edge tech, next one being Brain Cancer potential first treatment), the stock has been raising and plunging all the way from $6 to $33 back to $6.80 in the pandemic. 

This can be explained by the hope it would come out with a covid vaccine using a revolutionary technology, but it is weird that it plunged that much because although they lost the government’s investment at the end, this new tech is apparently still promising, and it’s even weirder considering all the other stuff and Brain Cancer thing. 

However, I then found [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/inovio-drops-after-u-s-cuts-off-funding-short-sellers-benefit)

Basically, it says that later in 2021, the stock have been massively shorted to the amount of $634 million.

Guess who’s on the list ? Yes, Citron Capital at it again, apparently it was their main gains for 2021, but they’re not the only ones and this has made the stock fall despite really good fundamentals as shown in OP’s post.

Conclusion and tl;dr: $INO is, among a lot of other great projects, literally working on the first promising Brain Cancer treatment EVER, yet some guys are heavily shorting it to the point it could very well go bankrupt. 

I’m long $INO, yolo and fuck Brain Cancer",['AMP']

n70ksi,,wallstreetbets,post,1620399814,"TA from an unbiased perspective on the game you are playing.First off, shout out to that ape that made that meme of Trump saying millions and billions over and over again, that was funny af. But this is not financial advice nor am I am financial advisor this is simply my personal opinion.

But, what I will say is that I analyze data for a living, I monitor patterns and trends, and heck I even taught math. Empirical knowledge is the best knowledge because it is backed by evidence and observation whether that is done personally or gathered through research, and that my friends is how I like to make my decisions as you should too.

In this TA (I am even hesitant to do a TA on $GME due to volatility) but I promise to be as objective as possible. I enjoy finding trades, and I love to find solid entry points, but what I have found out over the years is that it is nearly impossible to perfectly time the bottom or the top which is why certain indicators are essential is recognizing a solid set up.

To make this super easy to understand I have narrowed down this T.A. to 4, yes only 4 indicators for you. RSI (relative strength index), Bollinger Bands, EMA (exponential moving average), and OBV (on balance volume).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alvmfjxvqpx61.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=48483d32c481c5090b1f35fd3c17a324d49b1646

RSI: Quick note - RSI under 30 is over sold, RSI over 70 is over bought which is why you will see strong upward advances (traders like to load up at low levels such as 30 and below and stock goes up) or corrections (traders like to sell off at these levels 70 and above and stock goes down). Bullish zone is between 40 to 85+ (stock will gradually increase).

$GME: The diagram above illustrates the Day chart. The RSI has never dropped below 40 since JULY 2020! The 40 range has developed a solid support which is why I think the stock will continue to rise. Regardless of every dip the stock experienced it has bounced off of the support and gradually increased which represents a bullish signal.

Bollinger Bands: Quick note - When Bollinger bands squeeze (the white lines) around the stock price means a lower volatility rate meaning high volatility is on its way. The direction of the volatility is dependent on other indicators which you will see how they all correlate.

$GME: Not trying to get ahead of myself, but with an increasing RSI, increasing OBV, and the stock remaining above the 55 EMA all indicators point up.

55 EMA: Quick note - everything as we know always deviates towards the mean (average). This is more than just stocks, look it up its wild. Why do you think the mean is one of the most used (and useful) forms of measurements? This can be applied to everything involving numbers. Anyway, anytime a stock remains above the 55 EMA (I use 55 because its a part of Fibonacci, that's a whole rabbit hole of it's own), it represents another bullish signal.

$GME: The yellow line represents the 55 EMA and anytime the stock came close or dropped slightly under we saw it bounce off and continue up. As of now it is currently trading along the 55 EMA with the Bollinger bands squeezing and if history continues to repeat itself we should see an increase in price.

OBV: Quick note - OBV is an indicator of momentum, and measures buying and selling pressure. In simple terms an increasing OBV shows that the volume on days when the stock price is increasing is greater than the volume on days when the stock price is decreasing. More buyers than sellers.

$GME: Increasing OBV, more buy volume than sell volume which will result in higher prices.

TLDR; I like numbers, I am good with numbers, and throughout this T.A. the goal was to remove all biases and stick to the technicals and fundamentals of what the stock was showing me. I notice a bullish RSI above 40 since July 2020, I notice Bollinger bands squeezing on the day chart, I notice a strong support at the 55 EMA, and I notice a constant increase in the OBV. I like to find solid trades that have potential and I see a lot of potential here. Not financial advice.",

n7misf,,wallstreetbets,post,1620470291,"Free Rolls Royce from $RYCEYListen here you fucking donkey,

If you do not own Rolls Royce shares, ask yourself why. The company's car branch just had their most successful quarter ever in 116 years, pulling in collaborations with Hermes, Chrome Hearts and Drake (yes, him). If you've had a pulse for the past month you must have seen these on your instagram feed. But that's not the reason I'm so bullish on this stock.

Before the pandemic they had an average share price of $12. IT IS CURRENTLY AT $1.5!!! (12 bil market cap) meaning the easiest 10x return you'll ever make.

The reason you're getting this discount now is because they make most of their revenue from supplying airplane engines and more importantly, fixing broken ones. With global travel coming to a halt, they weren't able to get that stream of money.

So how did they not go bankrupt with their main source of income suddenly vanishing? Simple, England loves Rolls Royce way too much to let them go bankrupt, they will pump money in that motherfucker like it's the Queen on life-support.

This thing is gonna moon on it's own, no short interest considered, which by the way keeps declining each month because no one with half a brain dares to short this stock, everyone knows it's only going up from here. If you invest enough, this company will basically give you a free Rolls Royce, make sure to get one with the star ceiling, so you can feel like you're on the moon every time you enter your car.

n6qu0p,,wallstreetbets,post,1620363810,"Are we headed for a massive failure in the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market, which would have massive repercussions on the economy as a whole?https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-says-stock-market-boom-ebullient-investors-warrant-caution-2021-05-06/

decent article by Reuters today on the possible bubble worries but its much deeper. there is a host of issues.. the income of the commercial real estate holders has been inflated due to covid and the need to keep the mortgages afloat. 

So as the income has gotten inflated and these properties were bought up during covid, real estate prices rose like crazy, Im sure you noticed. So all the mortgages come in with inflated incomes but there is a selection of mortgages which yield higher premiums as they carry more risk. As maybe you know these are bundled, rated, and sold. Called Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities and there are plenty of CMBS ETFs worth total of hundreds of billions, if not over a trillion, on the market. With very large institutional holdings, obviously, which have large holdings.

The FED released their [Financial Stability Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20210506.pdf) today. Basically saying valuations are high. Equities more than doubled the avg annual growth (22.5 to 9%) last year, treasury securities have tripled avg annual growth (26 to  8.3%), high yield and unrated bonds have almost quadrupled it (25 to 7.1). Not to mention the risk premiums on high yield unrated bonds are to 2008 levels. 

Here is a key paragraph from the report on the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities market: ""Other indicators continue to show strains in CRE markets. Vacancy rates continue to increase, and rent growth has declined fur-ther. Additionally, delinquency rates on com-mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which usually contain riskier loans, remain elevated. Finally, the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks, on net, reported weaker demand for most CRE loans and tighter lending standards in the fourth quarter of  2020 (figure 1-14)""

So basically, Commerial Real Estate is on an obvious bubble, about to come back down, and when it does, it is going to create a whole lot of turmoil. It will be reminiscent of 2008 as the bonds fail and tumble the house of cards.. again. Fuck.

Now Im sure if I know this, much smarter people do and have started hedging a market failure. So I have been paying attention to larger market options plays and noticed 60 million in puts bought on the S&P 500 today 7/16 strike 4000, 7/30 strike 3900, 9/17 strike 3100 and 3000 (30+million spent on just 9/17). All in large bulk orders. 

I am of the thesis we are about to see a massive correction on this mess.

I have no bear position and am sharing it as soon as I can because I think it is important.",['SPGI']

""John M Griffen and Alex Priest are, respectively, a prominent professor of finance and a Ph.D. candidate at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. In a [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) released last November, they sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019.

“Overall,” they write, “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.” This was just the average, however: Some originators — including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse, “having more than 35% of their loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatement.”

UT Study referenced: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3671162](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162)

TLDR: The Dollar General that you go to while your wife is with her boyfriend is getting a loan on overstated operating income, when it goes under it's put back in another CMBS security with a slightly different address.  


""Flynn also alleges in the complaint that changes in names and addresses when loans are moved out of old trusts and into new ones are not an accident but suggestive of deliberate obfuscation. “The correlation of name and address changes with inflated numbers,” he says, “is something like 95 percent.”""

This thing involves like most big banks so nothing to see here....people (companies in this case drunk on low rates and ass loads of debt with low rates) always pay their mortgage....right","['PH', 'DG', 'MS']"
n6qu0p,gx930x7,wallstreetbets,comment,1620376298,"Here is where greed always gets the best of the greedy: mortgages increase and increase and increase to the point where they become unaffordable and the people just quit.

There you are then with your super duper building. It’s empty and nobody’s showing up to replace the previous tenants because you made it unaffordable. Unaffordable: an inability to afford a product or service. Then the show stops. 

Every month the property is empty is a month of no income. Also: there’s a raging pandemic, people weren’t coming to the office anyway. What is the first thing companies do in that kind environment: they call everybody they regularly pay money to in order to renegotiate their contracts. And when that equation no longer works, it’s adios boys and girls, smell you later.

Eventually you’ll price everybody out of the market. Which you can be smug about until you realise that it means you’re not getting paid anymore, by anyone. Smart!",
n6qu0p,gx8tk4z,wallstreetbets,comment,1620367980,"This is the logical progression due to covid. May not necessarily happen too soon. But if everyone is working from home, businesses don't want to pay 30k or 5k in rent each month if no one's in the office. So as those leases expire, they won't get renewed. If no one fills their spot then you have increased vacancies. Increased vacancies for longer durations will lead to defaults to foreclosures to firesale prices and/or auctions.

A proxy for this is WeWork although they deal with much smaller customers. They'll see turnover quicker than the rest of the commercial market but they'll also see stagnation quicker.",
