Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

His methodology is flawed: a stock price being higher some years after a short report is not really proof of the thesis, or much at all.  There's umpteen related and unrelated reasons that could be.  A truly false or inaccurate short report is quickly flushed out and doesn't really hurt committed shareholders.  

One thing I've learned over time is that short research can be perfectly accurate and damning, and yet a stock and company still do well regardless.

Shorts are not the evil demons as beginning investors are trained on Reddit to think they are.  In most cases, shorts are actually buyers.  They just think the price or timing should be different.

n2wwda,,stocks,post,1619921431,"Waste Management (NYSE: $WM) stock DD i wrote for a discord I'm inWhen searching for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord, I initially was struggling to land on a company. There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.","['RSG', 'WM', 'HBI']"

n2hzd3,,stocks,post,1619874389,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

**Performance of Motely Fool Premium Recommendations** 

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|**SPY**|**Change over SPY**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Quarter|6%|3%|3%|
|One Year|24%|11%|13%|
|Two Year|67%|20%|47%|
|Till Date|134%|71%|63%|

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

**Performance of Motely Fool Sell Recommendations** 

&#x200B;

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|
|:-|:-|
|If you followed Fool's Sell Recommendations|134%|
|If you did not follow Fool's Sell Recommendations|167%|

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

They will use tricks like establishing time limits to pressure you into buying without thinking. If you have a strong mind, then it might be probably fine. 

In addition, Motley Fool goes for growth stocks, most of which are tech based, so QQQ or some weightes combination of QQQ and SPY may be a better benchmark if you want a more accurate comparison. Their investment returns look a lot worse when we compare them to QQQ or ARK Invest's funds which also focus on tech growth stocks for the most part. So if you want to invest with that style, there are other options.

If Jassy is half as good as Bezos, their ability to succeed in any market will make them incredibly robust -- while avoiding concerns about becoming a monopoly in any one area. eCommerce is still a small fraction of overall commerce, and AWS is a profit machine.

I'm also heavy on Apple and Microsoft, but a bit less. Apple has an incredible hardware side, with innovations like the M1 chip likely to result in massive sales for years to come. But it also recognizes that it needs to transition from hardware (phones specifically) to software in order to maintain their growth rate -- their ability to diversify into a services model will be important for their long-term success. They have no cloud computing, which to me seems odd as it would be a natural extension of iCloud and an easy profit maker. I'm also a bit worried about the $90B share buyback -- while it's good for shareholders like me short-term, it implies that they have no better use for the money, like R&D. It might be evolving into a value company, not a growth company, which in tech is a dangerous thing.

Microsoft is the safest option -- it trades at a low multiple, is well diversified, and has a great CEO. Azure will keep them growing for the next several years, although it does have tough competition. The main reasons it's not my dominant position: they haven't had the same historical growth rate as Amazon or Apple, are pretty weak in the hardware department (particularly when compared to Apple), and don't have a great reputation among consumers for quality (few people really like MS Office or Windows, they just don't have other options in most circumstances).

I don't have Google or Facebook. I like Google, and I plan on adding to it if there's an opportunity. I'm a bit less enthusiastic about it, because it has less of a moat than the others and has had a recent run-up in price, so I don't think it's a bargain right now.

I'm most bearish on Facebook. They almost have an anti-moat; a ton of people younger than 40 really hate the company and its leader. Their main site will diminish in significance as demographics shift, so they need to keep acquiring the next trendy social media site to stay relevant. I view that as a dangerous game -- maybe they can pull it off, but it seems like much more of a gamble than the others. 

Warren Buffet made a good point in his recent shareholder meeting -- none of the top 20 companies by market cap from 30 years ago are still in the top 20. No one could've realistically predicted the current top 20 back then, and several of them didn't even exist then.

Article for those who want to scroll through quickly:

U.S. companies are leaping above expectations on first-quarter earnings, giving investors stronger confirmation that profit growth will be able to support the market this year.

A big piece of that growth is coming once again from technology and growth companies, which suggests greater durability in companies that underperformed more economically focused value names for months.

Earnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows. With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

About 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.

Some strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 (.SPX) is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.

""The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that's because you're seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there's still more room,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

The high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.

Citing stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index (.SPX) was last at about 4,180.

Stocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.

Earnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.

However, ""tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That's what I find amazing,"" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.

""Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,"" he said.

Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), Cummins Inc (CMI.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).

The first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.

Value has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index (.RLV) remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index (.RLG) is up about 8% in that time.

Technology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv's data.

Tech (.SPLRCT) is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.

While the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.

""It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.

""We're actually carving out a third group ... defensives,"" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now. 

Its hard to find a bearish view on the current market situation when so many companies are beating earnings. Maybe in the short term we'll see some volatility as we finish getting through earnings season, but I don't think we'll see much more falling, if any.","['COP', 'PFE', 'WFC', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'CMI', 'JPM', 'ATVI']"

That makes zero sense.""

Until I went and looked in the indenture, and this paper is structured in a way that I'd never really thought about or encountered, since it seems like it functions like a call option with no premium (note holders can convert to equity at their discretion any time over the next six years) but in the legal vehicle similar to a SPAC (if you don't exercise the call option available to buy shares at the current strike price - or in the case of a SPAC, the committed capital isn't deployed via deSPAC merger + IPO - the original notional amount is returned to the public share holders / PIPE entities).

>**In connection with the pricing of the notes, Snap plans to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes** or their respective affiliates or other financial institutions, collectively, the capped call counterparties. **The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Snap Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of Snap’s Class A common stock on any conversion of notes** or at Snap’s election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments Snap is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any such converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.

>In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates may purchase shares of Snap Class A common stock or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Snap Class A common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. **This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Snap Class A common stock or the notes at that time.**

This lends the impression that this transaction is part of a broader M&A process. I suspect the private buyers of the convertible notes are an M&A target SNAP is looking to scoop up, but instead of further diluting their current shareholders now by issuing new stock to the target, it appears they're delaying that for some time by issuing the converts and effectively deferring the increase to their cost of capital down the road until if/when the notes are exercised and equity is issued.

NGL, pretty clever way of arranging your cap stack, especially when leverage profile isn't a huge concern. Curious to see what further merger details come out of this, since it's almost guaranteed to be related to part of a bigger acquisition / transaction financing.

Should also note that these notes aren't available for the public to purchase. They're a 144A/PIPE private placement with individuals/entities that pass the income/net asset threshold - probably part of the reason why it makes no sense to those of us relying on publicly available data.",

n2nmdi,gwl876l,stocks,comment,1619904726,"The instrument isn't quite as cut and dried as you portray. It has an element of potential equity participation as the carrot.  

As for SNAP's viability going forward, despite debt and lack of profit, many people may not realize there's been a major shift with respect to SNAP that kicked in about six months ago. 

Before that they were regarded as just another money-losing fad that would go away.  But to the analysts' surprise, SNAP managed to cook up viable plans to attract advertisers, and there's lots of evidence it's working.  They've had a couple of billion dollar quarters, and the inflection point of break even to profitable is coming much sooner than most imagined.  I think (?) SNAP has quietly snuck into third place among social plays.

And even the assumption that ""they're not profitable"" is superficial.  If you dig into the details of recent numbers, they could be profitable however they're putting that money into programs that attract influential content, which supercharges user growth.  And it's apparently working.  So the ""losing money"" stat is misleading, and when looked at from a different perspective, could be considered good news, not bad.  As someone who loaded up on AMZN during the final years of people saying ""but they're not profitable"" (while those people weren't noticing that profit or loss were levers controlled by Amazon) it's a familiar pattern that I find tempting.

As they've aged, it's been noted that SNAP has outlasted multiple projections of their death, by innovating.  They were considered a fad of being the disappearing messages app.  They re-invented to do filters, which continue to be inexplicably popular.  They've re-invented to do stories.  They're re-inventing now as group messaging, which is hot, and experiential, which is perfect for the now rebounding travel advertising segment.  It's becoming harder to bet on SNAP just fading away as had always been assumed.  

SNAP is also considered one of the less harmful type of social media and tech plays.  Where FB is considered pure evil, SNAP is considered benign.  Turns out that's good if you want to sell advertising.  

During this earnings season, SNAP weathered it about the best, compared to peers like FB and PINS.   Maybe next week will be SNAP's turn to get beat down, but so far, so good.","['AMZN', 'FB']"
n2ok5c,,stocks,post,1619894699,"I don't understand how dividends affect a stock price.I read today that if a stock is trading at 20.04 and pays a .04 dividend, on ex-dividend day the stock will adjust down to 20.00 to reflect that dividend no longer being available to buyers. 

I got down voted to hell for saying it's not necessarily 1:1 like that, but actually now I'm just confused.  Is it actually 1:1 like that?  Does the stock price adjust down automatically by that exact amount? I was under the impression that prices were only affected by supply and demand.  What about open limit orders?  Do they automatically adjust down by that exact amount? I saw this somewhere. 

Or is it 100% due to market forces?  Since investors know they are no longer entitled to that money on ex-dividend day, they will naturally be willing to pay .04 less for the stock, thus they adjust their bid sizes accordingly. 

The info I'm finding online is not clear on it.  Some sources are saying it's automatic, some are saying it's market forces (or maybe I'm just being thick). Anyway, sorry for spreading misinformation in the other thread, but it would be cool if someone could actually clarify how this works.

EDIT: Already getting conflicting information here.  So looks like I'm not the only dummy.  Let's see if we can clear this up together.

EDIT 2: So I was pretty much right.  Thanks guys for explaining it clearly to me!",
n2ok5c,gwkljzf,stocks,comment,1619894875,It’s not literally 1:1 because the stock price is determined by emotions not logic. But it’s essentially accurate.,
n2ok5c,gwl0grj,stocks,comment,1619901564,"I think you’re getting mixed answers on “automatic.” If I’ve interpreted you correctly I think you intended it to be synonymous with enforced but some people have responded interpreting it as instantaneous.

The following is my understanding.

TLDR: Both supply and demand curves move by 4¢ because both buyers and sellers evaluate the return they will get from the stock as 4¢ less. This causes the price to change by 4¢.

Not TLDR: There is no enforcement of a change in price whether by clearing house, computer, or other entity (so far as I know anyway. Hypothetically I guess any of these could try to manipulate the price, but why manipulate to the same spot I expect market forces to take it.) Because information on the dividend is known well in advance the price can change nearly instantaneously in response to the dividend from the moment just before close to the moment just after open, when the stock is no longer entitled to the dividend.

The price decreases approximately 4¢ because approximately everybody knows they will get 4¢ less value from owning it. This applies to both sellers and buyers. 

A trade occurs at what a buyer and seller each consider to be fair by their own evaluation (ignoring exceptions)

Suppose two people were about to trade $20.04 for one share because the seller wanted the cash and the buyer the stock, but they just missed market close and have to wait til the next day. So they come back next morning, both know the stock will provide 4¢ less to the owner, so the buyer now sees their fair price as 4¢ less and likewise the seller, when they evaluate the stock, see it as worth 4¢ less. The buyer offers 4¢ less at $20 (assuming the only thing that changed in their evaluation was that the stock will now provide them 4¢ less return,) the seller accepts what they believe to be a fair offer from the buyer and the price of the most recent trade is now $20 not $20.04 like it would have been the day before.

I saw someone suggest that the dividend comes from the market cap or maybe worded it like it comes out of the stock price in some non market enforced way, I disagree. Market Cap= Shares*Price like you said, the above explains a change in share price in response to a dividend, the market cap follows not the other way around.

Saw another comment about the share price changing because of a post dividend sell off, again I disagree. If there was a sell off or buy up it would be because investors for whatever reason want to get rid of or accumulate shares based on the timing of the next dividend, but it would seem strange to me that this wouldn’t be priced in since dividends in the market happen frequently and if there was always a sell off after a dividend people would learn to expect it, and trade accordingly in anticipation of a loss of value. If there was for whatever reason a sell off or buy up it would be in addition to the expected 4¢ change, that’s my take.

Edit: Changed a clause in final paragraph",
n2ok5c,gwlbzel,stocks,comment,1619906237,"A share price is really meant to reflect the worth of a company at a moment in time.

Now, once such asset is cash. So if a company then choose to give cash out to shareholders, that must logically reduce the worth of the company because we've reduced the assets. 

&#x200B;

In a purely logical and fundamental extension of that, then the company is worth less and so the share price reduces. 

&#x200B;

Of course there are technical and imperfections in the market (including people, and all sorts of external factors), and this is why a share price can sometimes reduce more or less than the dividend, but basically, the way I think about it is above, and that helps me get my head around it!",

If owning a stock on Tuesday is going to pay me a known 40 cents, but that same stock has some negative news that I decide hurts its potential by 10 cents, I might decide it's worth paying 30 cents extra for it.  But I might also factor in that the 40 cents won't be delivered for a couple weeks, which is an opportunity cost, so maybe I'll only which to pay 28 cents extra, not 30.  But maybe there's a sense of strengthening demand in their market sector, which I guess is worth a further 15 cents.  But maybe I want to gamble that less diligent investors might only be thinking of the 40 cent dividend, and that they might sell off the stock after Tuesday regardless of the improving market, so maybe I'll wait and get a better price.

There was a study a while ago that found that if you invested in the original list of companies in the S&P 500 and didn't follow the index,  you'd outperform the index by a wide margin. That's because the index has a history of removing companies while they're down and later adding them back when they recover. If you simply held on to the companies, you'd have done better.

What I have found is that I like each one for different reasons, but ones which are relevant to you:

If you want fractional shares, then pretty much you're limited to Fidelity or M1.   Schwab does fractional shares, but only for companies in the S&P 500 and no ETFs.   Interactive brokers is also an option but I don't have an open account over there, and they typically cater to more active traders so I can't provide much information.  I'm sure there are smaller ones out there, but I don't think I'd venture out beyond the ones I mentioned above.

Really I think the option comes down to your investment style - M1 is better for long-term investments which are 'ratio driven'.   For instance:  ""Every week, pull X dollars from my checking account, and then invest automatically to try to maintain a ratio of 60% VTI and 40% VXUS"".    You can manually trade, but the free service only has one trade window - basically all previously-entered trades (including the automatic ones) execute in a window that opens at market open each day and ends when all of the trades are done.    This is fine for long-term investing, not so great if you're trying to time the market.

Fidelity is more of a hands-on approach.  And is better if you're actually buying and selling interactive stocks.   I know some people have gotten around the transfer issue you mention by setting up a monthly schedule on say the 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st.   Doesn't make it consistent as far as which day it comes out, and there will often be a missing week at the end of the month.   Another thing to look into is whether you can push money to fidelity from your checking account (perhaps to a fidelity cash management account?) instead of pulling.",['SPGI']

n2v4ns,,stocks,post,1619914896,"Self Driving Cars and Tesla's FSDDisclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

&#x200B;

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

&#x200B;

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into **perception-planning-control** blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD. Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.

&#x200B;

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 2010s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + HD maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach.

&#x200B;

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about the perception part. As I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years.
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate.
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago.  There are also progresses of LiDAR in thick snow and fogs, check University Waterloo and MIT media lab's works.
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

&#x200B;

Alright, suppose that Tesla successfully solved this perception problem using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next? We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the hardest part. What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents: the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even if the road can be unpaved and covered with leaves.

&#x200B;

The devil lies in busy urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive? How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc., but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the subtle social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties who may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the main reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015-ish. You can find plenty videos of Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver on YT. They can operate in these scenarios, thought not elegantly.  

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Tesla barely touches this today, as you can find in some beta tester's video of FSD in SF.  It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are officially entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. By ""official"" I mean running their driverless cab services for public, but the tech has been tested in many more cities including SF, and they just did not advertise that. 

  
BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach. Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long: Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  Currently FSD beta 8.2's disengagement data shows 10-20 miles per intervention or complete disengagement (again, from beta testers' own video). This metric for Waymo and Cruise last year is 29000 miles, a few orders of magnitude in difference.

However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales POV).

n2u5o8,,stocks,post,1619911451,"My take on the SPXThis is all Elliot Wave analysis, the only wave analysis I've been using for years.

Last year about a month after the March drop, the S&amp;P500 was at around 2807 points. At this time I used Fibonacci extension which told me that the SPX was heading for around 3542 before heading for a nasty correction.

When I started commenting in the daily chat and posting my analysis, saying that the SPX was heading for 3542 when it was at 2807, everybody called me a dumbass. And I mean everybody.

All the gay bears were out, guys were losing their life savings bleeding and bleeding averaging down more and more. 3542 seemed like such a fucking long shot. Unemployment, vaccine timeline worries, all that propaganda was RAMPANT. We saw all the bears get decimated and the bulls making the easiest money of their lives.

[Here](https://imgur.com/I0NEx0X) is a pic of the Fibonacci extension and what I was calling for at the time.

Well as we know, the S&amp;P500 got to 3588 before correcting for about 2 months, or 58 days. [Here](https://imgur.com/mtpCyod) is the length of the correction.

Well, what does that matter? Why should you give a fuck?

Well, I've used the exact same method to calculate the end of this wave we are currently on.

[As you can see in this zoomed out version](https://imgur.com/uVhPldA) after using Fibonacci extension the end of this wave will be around 4635. I don't know the timeframe, but after that point we are in for a SERIOUS correction. This will fully complete the wave, so expect worse than what we've seen already.

There are five waves which complete before the ABC correction. Right now we are in the third wave. This is usually the longest, most aggressive wave up. We will go into the fourth correction wave at some point, before getting back into the fifth wave and finalizing around 4635. Use this information however you like, I don't really give a fuck if you believe me or not. But since I only commented and didn't create a post last time, I wanted to have some documentation about what's going to happen.

HOW TO PLAY THIS:

1) Low maintenance method : Buy some UPRO and dont even look at it until the SPX is sitting around 4620 and up. The final fifth wave could be extended, meaning it could go a lot higher. But I will probably close positions around this point and watch, maybe ladder some volatility.

2) Options way : Well we know we are going to get to around 4635, with a correction in between. This can be played a few different ways, probably a good method would be calls 3-5 months out. Do the same with long volatility. The only time I would buy shorts is if we get close to 4600 without a big correction. Then I would short, if it falls hard close, then ladder calls as it will correct before hitting the 4635 mark and above.

Anyways, if this doesn't pan out I won't be deleting this post. But I stand by this analysis. When I first looked to see the 3542 I thought something was wrong because of all the bad news and with everything going on. I doubted the analysis. Now I don't. This is a bullish as fuck market. Until it isnt. Then we play the down trend. 


But any gay bears who come out talking about inflation, Biden taxes, any of that, dont listen to them. Just remember

n2idnt,,stocks,post,1619875836,"Help me understand dividends. Can I make easy money off an investment then pull it out again?I really don't get them. Is it just like a little bonus, paid out once a year to its shareholders? And can you just make easy money?

Let me explain;

Say i have $20k to invest.

I looked at a random stock list on Finviz of those that pay dividends. One of these is MPLX.

Even better, it looks like it takes place this week. According to a press release last week, it says this;

*"" The board of directors of the general partner of MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) has declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6875 per common unit for the first quarter of 2021, or $2.75 on an annualized basis. The distribution will be paid on May 14, 2021, to common unitholders of record as of May 7, 2021.""*

The dividen yield is 10% but I dunno if this is good or not. I've heard IBM is a good stock for this, but I really don't get it. 

So, does this mean, that anyone who holds stock before May 7th, gets the cash payment dividend on May 14th? I know my broker automatically gives me the dividend as I've had a couple in the past, for a few dollars. 

Assuming this is true, if you went and bought 740 shares on Monday, this would cost you just shy of $20,000 ($26.99 per share).

Does this mean, that by the 7th that valuation would be eligible and on the 14th you'd get paid the dividend? 

Next, assuming that is correct, how do you work it out? It says 0.68 per common unit, so does this mean they will give you 0.68 per share, which based on the 740 puchase share example, 0.68x740 = 503.2 (so $503.20 dollars). So if you invest on the Monday, hold until the 14th, you get 500 dollars for putting that 20,000 dollars in?

Is this right or am I chatting nuts? It also says this is quarterly, so you can expect something similar every 3 months, so $2000 a year just for putting the money in?

Assuming this is right, what's to stop people investing in the week before, then pulling everything out when the money gets paid? Nothing I assume? 

And lastly, if all the above is correct, does anyone know some long term growth stocks that would be stable for large investment that also pay a handsome dividend?",['IBM']

n2idnt,gwjns14,stocks,comment,1619880621,"I've taken up dividend investing in the past few months, here's what I know so far:

1) if you hold a share before the ex-dividend date, you are eligible to get a dividend payout from that stock

2) dividends come from the company's profits- they are removed from the stock price, but not covered as a loss. So in your example (simplifying down to owning 1 share) of you have a share that is $27, that pays out 68 cents a share, you end up with a share that costs $26.32, and 68 cents off free spending money, and your brokerage shouldn't be showing that position in the red.

3) there are 5 types of dividend payout; weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. They pay out 52, 12, 4, 2, and 1 time per year, respectively.
These can happen at any date/day.

4) the strategy you described to but, qualify, then sell is a used tactic, but it's not really sustainable. There's several videos on it and it's problems. Because a lower price leads to more shares being scooped up, the share price tends to bounce back after dividend payment, so it's usually a better strategy just to hold onto your investment until you hear news that gives you an indication to sell.

5) look for companies in the dividend aristocrats/ kings list; companies like T, VZ, MO, KMB, XOM, O, MAIN, AFL, and CVX have 4-7% dividend yields, while also increasing their dividend payout so the longer you hold a position the more it makes for you.

Side advice: Don't chase yield, chase companies with stability that have a history of increasing dividends at a high rate. I'd rather have $1000 in AAPL than $1000 in a company with a 14% yield that'll crash in a month. The only accepting to that are a few ETFs out there that do covered calls, they're very stable and barely change in value, but pay out roughly 10-12%, they're not growth companies but they do pay monthly and can be good compounders; QYLD and RYLD are the 2 I'm invested in.

Of course, make sure to do your own research and only buy into companies you like.

n2jk2k,,stocks,post,1619879741,"Let's talk Lumber Gang! Bullish on $BCC and $LPX. Bearish on Home Builders.First DD about something I'm familiar with.

I am currently in FAANG tickers plus MSFT. Earnings were good but the stock is either not moving, or went up and came back down. I’m planning to sell everything I’m green in and move the majority over to something that has been killing it which is lumber. It can add some more variety to this sub.

My husband is in the industry (his company is not publicly traded) and things have been good and bad. It’s been good because people have been paying ridiculous prices for houses. Combine that with the building material shortage and he has been able to raise his profit margins. Very nice commission checks coming home.

It’s bad because there is not enough lumber for everyone and he’s been having hard conversations with builders who don’t get that they will have to slow down because product is running out.

Here are how lumber futures have been doing.

5 Day – 9.45%

1 Month – 48.41%

3 Month – 69.36%

YTD – 72.15%

1 Year – 359.39%

If anyone knows how to invest in futures without receiving actual product I would love to know. Don’t want to be that guy that got a bunch of oil delivered to him.

With how things are going we are going to continue to see a rise in lumber for at least through the summer. The biggest problem is obtaining Engineered Wood Products (EWP) and OSB. Home Depot has quadrupled the price of OSB over the past year. There is also a resin shortage that is needed to make these products. Timber is cheap but the bottleneck is sawmills. Either they have reduced capacity due to covid or they are switching business to OSB because it is more profitable.

I’m looking at companies such as $BCC (38% last 3 months), $WY (23% last 3 months), $LPX (71% last 3 months). They have had great runs and are currently in a dip from the last few days. (Hopefully a dip and not the top).

First companies that will be screwed sooner than later will most likely be home builders. They will soon realize they have been building houses for free and will get hit first. They try to hit a 35% profit margin. That margin is eroding by rising costs but they are under contract. Contracts last about 6 months. So expect their profits to go down. Unless they have been really good at guessing lumber futures and buying appropriately.

Home builders have been hitting highs and could be shorted or have puts placed on them. Just look at the top 10 list of publicly traded developer stocks. Be careful with timing. They’ve had big jumps this last week.

Bear case: The fed could finally raise interest rates which would decrease demand and let supply catch up. More investment can go into building out saw mills. Builders can get creative and use different materials. This is where steel gang can benefit. Supply could eventually catch up but it may take some time. This is a several month play for now.

Current position is shares in $BCC. I've seen nice steady rise over the last few months.

TLDR: Lumber has been on a great run and is getting more scarce. Buy lumber tickers such as $BCC, $WY and $LPX and puts on big home developers. Mid term play.","['MSFT', 'WY', 'HD']"

I doubt mills are going to make capital investments on increased output when according to [FRED data,](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU28000003132110001A) employment of sawmill workers is at historical lows (other states with available data like OR and WA are similar), which implies either they've been divesting production capacity or they have the machines, but not the employees.

n2r411,,stocks,post,1619902104,"Should I be concerned my brokerage turned my ETF holding into a short position?Long story short (no pun intended) back in January I decided to open a Roth IRA account and I invested $12k into a clean energy ETF. After seeing the ETF decline in value to $11k, I transferred the Roth IRA account to a new brokerage & sold the ETF position, now converted into a mutual fund. I then bought xx shares of GME during the recent dip to $160. However, the day after GME opened at $150 before shooting up to $185 after hours, I was shocked to get margin called by the new brokerage 

The brokerage informed me, ""The recent purchase of securities in your account has created a cash call. If this call is not met within the time required by Regulation T, per Federal Reserve Board, portions of your portfolio may be sold to cover this cash call."" Reluctantly and without immediately reaching out to the brokerage for further clarification, I sold my GME shares that same day at $177 for over $1k profit (bringing my account back above $12k for the first time).

What happened next was even more surprising! I let $12.3k cash settle for the T+2 settlement period and assumed that I had been margin called because somehow the initial purchase of GME interfered with the settling of money from my sale of the mutual fund. Instead, after 2 days the mutual fund showed up again in my account as a short position! Now, I believe what happened is the brokerage bought the mutual fund position from me ""on loan"" instead of simply selling it. In one sense this seems to be great because now my account has roughly doubled in value to nearly $24k with the mutual fund short position showing up as a positive asset.

On the other hand, I still want to own xx shares of my favorite stock without risk of being margin called if GME drops in price again due to its inherent volatitlity. So really what I'm wondering is:

* Was the margin call a one-time-only occurrence while my brokerage was setting up the short position in my account, or can it happen again if the value of my stock holdings declines beneath the value of the mutual fund?
* Can I sell the (now $11.5k) mutual fund short position itself for an equivalent amount of cash?
* Why would they even do this to me instead of just seling the mutual fund flat out?
* What happens if I try to transfer the account again to another new brokerage? Would the short mutual fund position get transferred too, or would it have to be unshorted by my current brokerage before I transfer the other stocks and/or cash I hold in the account? 
* Ultimately, does having the short position held in this account as an ""asset"" a positive incentive to stay with this broker, or does it create a crazy ridiculous amount of risk of getting margin called & having to potentially put forward extra cash to cover if my stocks decline rather than agreeing to sell at a loss? (I got super lucky this time!)

I'll probably call the brokerage on Monday for answers but meanwhile it would be great if anyone who has experienced and/or has knowledge about this kind of situation could give me a better idea about what sort of unicorn or beast I might be dealing with!

The first is a management fee. The manager will take somewhere in the ballpark of 1% which starts them off behind. Their career is directly tied to their performance and so there is an incredibly strong incentive to be conservative with any speculation.

>Another example of manipulation is placing simultaneous buy and sell orders through different [brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp) that cancel each other out. This form of manipulation gives the perception, due to the higher volume, that there is increased interest in the security.

n2kgcb,gwjtb0m,stocks,comment,1619882996,"Sorry if I have some of this wrong.. only recently been getting into Dividends myself.

Ex Dividend Date is the date you need to have OWNED the shares. Buy them BEFORE this date. If you buy them ON this date, I believe that won’t count.

There is a separate Pay Date. Depending on the stock you own it could be yearly, quarterly, or monthly.

If I ever wonder about specific dates and also to look at past dates I just google “XYZ dividend history” and the first result every time is the NASDAQ website.

Example ORC:
[ORC Dividend History](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/orc/dividend-history)

Declaration Date is the date they announced the dividend.

Ex/EFF Date is the date you MUST OWN this stock. Buy BEFORE this date.

Payment Date is when you get paid based on what you owned on the Ex Date.

Cash Amount is the amount you’ll be paid per share.


I like this site because gives you a history and how consistent they’ve been and the amount it’s been paid at.


One fun thing to know - is AFTER the Ex Date you can sell those shares and still get the dividend. Make sure you sell AFTER that date though. But be careful as the stock does reduce in price due to the dividend payout. So maybe wait a week or two if you think it’ll continue to grow but want to drop the stock.","['GOOGL', 'NDAQ']"

n2kgcb,gwkiek1,stocks,comment,1619893519,"For all intents and purposes, think of the ex-dividend date as the date the company pulls the cash out and sets it aside to pay the next dividend and it begins trading with no declared dividend on that date. 

The key date in terms of receiving that dividend, or not, is the record date, which is usually one day after the ex-dividend date. If you have *settled* shares of the stock on the record date, you are entitled to that dividend payment even if you sell your shares before that dividend is paid.

Since stocks in the US are T+2 settlement, you would need to execute your purchase of the stock the day before the ex-dividend date. That way, it will have settled by close of business on the record date and you will receive that dividend.

Ex: company declares a dividend with ex-date of 2/15, record date of 2/16, and pay date of 3/15. You would need to purchase the shares on, or before, 2/14 to receive that dividend. If you purchased on 2/15 or later, you would not receive the 3/15 dividend payment.",

Considering he doesn’t want to put any money in the market through his entire career, he probably won’t sleep well at night knowing his “respectable amount” of money, which I assume is his life’s savings, will be in the market even via ETFs. 

If he trusts the banks, going into a mutual fund isn’t always a bad thing. Sure the fees are higher than your average ETF, but if it makes your father sleep well at night knowing that his money is managed by the bank, it is worth it. There are plenty of people that suit the mutual fund type and it’s fine. 

Also consider switching to other HISA banks. There are often promotions you can take advantage of by switching and opening HISAs (at least in Canada) that can grant you 1-2% interest over a 6 month period. It can be a hassle switching banks often, but it can also be worth it to squeeze some extra % more. 

I don’t think you should convince your father to invest his money. Yes, it isn’t the best financial thing to do to have everything in a HISA, but you also don’t want to lose your father’s hard earned money. He might not be able to even tolerate ETF volatility and end up bailing on a market downturn.  It might be better to seek out a financial advisor to help him.",

n24g0m,,stocks,post,1619819824,"PLTR CEO Alex Karp recent selling breakdown First of all, this is not FUD. I'm just trying to break down the given numbers on Karp's recent stock sales.   
Alex Karp has sold over 54 million shares so far according to [http://openinsider.com/insider/Karp-Alexander-C./1823951](http://openinsider.com/insider/Karp-Alexander-C./1823951)According to [https://fintel.io/i/karp-alexander-c](https://fintel.io/i/karp-alexander-c) his last file date states he has around 85 million shares. After his recent selloff, Alex Karp still holds around 65.9 million shares. So that means he has sold around 45% of his total PLTR shares up to this date. Now, these numbers may not be exact but 54 million shares at $20 per share roughly make up that $ 1.1 billion dollars. Can someone verify this seems like an excessive amount?

According to Karp (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/palantir-ceo-karp-earned-1point1-billion-in-2020-tied-to-equity-awards.html) ), this sale is to offset taxes from his share options.

After some more calculations, Karp now holds roughly around 4.25%ish stake in PLTR. Given that (66mil shares/86mil shares \* 0.055 stakes (source number from [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr) ownership) It seems like Karp gave up around 3.45% of his stake in PLTR to offset taxes.

However, according to the SEC filing, Karp holds an initial 68.8 million options contracts that are due to expire on December 3rd. He still holds a majority of them although undisclosed at this point. Will be interesting to see what he does with them.

It is advancing the Wicheeda Rare Earth Elements (REE) deposit through resource expansion drilling, metallurgical optimization, and initiation of environmental baseline studies. A Preliminary Economic Analysis of the site is due to be released next month.

**Highlights**

* The Wicheeda site is huge and is highly accessible. It will be one of the biggest Rare Earth Metal mines in North America.
* THE COMPANY IS CALLED DEFENSE METALS AND HAS PICTURES OF FIGHTERS AND TANKS ON THEIR WEBSITE
* Initial testing from the site has discovered high-grade deposits of rare earth metals.
* The company is undervalued compared to the sites potential. Estimates predict there could be up to $6 Billion worth of Rare Earth Metals there.
* A full Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA) is currently being completed and due to report in May.      Rare Earth Metals (REM) are a strategic interest to Western Governments.
* Rare Earth Metals are vital for defense production, batteries, electric motors and others. The US Government is looking to support and invest in REE miners.
* A strong Board of Directors with alot of experience rapidly developing companies. Several have experience in miners.
* PRIME candidate to be bought out by a Chinese or US company

The West currently relies on China for 80% of Rare Earth Metals. The demand for these metals will increase substantially over the next few years. Western governments, especially the US, will look to develop a domestic supply. DEFN are a prime candidate for support from the US Government.

The stock is currently valued at $30million. The PEA is due to come out in May. Assesing the initial drill results show the site could have up to $6 billion in rare earth metals. DEFN has plans to develop a fully integrated site at Wicheeda and look at developing other sites.",

So firstly, this wasn't exactly my main inspiration, but retroactively I did realize that my portfolio was, in a way, similar to [Ray Dalio's All-Weather portfolio and also the Golden Butterfly portfolio](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/all-weather-golden-butterfly/).  The asset allocations are not really the same but I do feel there's some resemblance in the approach.

The All-Weather portfolio provides less return than VTI/VTSAX (total stock market index), but it also promises to perform in all scenarios.  Ray Dalio said it also protects you from any black swan events... theoretically you should never be able to lose.  The Golden Butterfly is the same idea. Take a look at these awesome stats from the link above:

**Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Fund**

* Average Annual Return +9.4%
* Deepest Drawdown (2008) **-49.3%**

**Golden Butterfly**

* Average Annual Return +7.94%
* Deepest Drawdown (2008) **-10.8%**

The Golden Butterfly has an average annual return that's about 1.5% lower compared to VTI/VTSAX, but with a proven track record of much less volatility: 5 times less during the 2008 crash, in fact.

Anyway, I can already tell I'm probably going to get flamed because ""my portfolio has nothing to do with the Golden Butterfly or Ray Dalio's idea"" (note: he did say that the percentages were not exact).  But whatever, hope I was able to share something cool with y'all and just note that my investment thesis isn't to completely replicate either of these two ideas, but rather create a portfolio that may perform in a similar way.  So, here goes:

**My all-weather portfolio for this crazy market**

*Like Ray Dalio, my percentages are not entirely exact, either.*

Roth IRA: **45% Target Retirement Fund** (90% stocks, 10% bonds, automatically rebalances as I approach retirement)

Taxable Account: (I use a taxable account as well because I may need to pull out some gains in the mid-term pre-retirement)

**VTI:** 15% (Total Stock Market)

**VXUS:** 7.5% (Total International Stock Market)

**MSFT**: 8%

**AAPL:** 6%

**Dividend Stocks:** 15% (I like tobacco: I hold BTI, PM, IMBBY)

**Various commodities and alt. assets:** 5% (mining stocks, bullion, I bought a small position in an ETF that tracks an asset which shall not be named here)

\---

If you run the math you could say this comes to about **75% growth** (index funds, MSFT, AAPL) and **25% defensive** (dividend stocks, commodities, bonds, etc.).

My only bond exposure is in my target retirement fund, and that's because they buy them for me.  Ray Dalio himself says bonds are trash right now, and I agree.  They are expensive and real yields are negative.  Thus, my dividend paying stocks act as a bond proxy.

I chose tobacco stocks because I think it's good business no matter what's going on.  All 3 of my companies are international players who have exposure to slower declines or even increases in smoking rates via global markets.  IMBBY is an absolute killer bang for your buck, but of all 3 of my companies it's the one that could be in danger of failing.  BTI and PM look like they could continue to see growth in their new product categories (heat-not-burn, vaping, cannabis).  Anyway, these could be sold and switched as needed, but in the medium-term they are holds.

My commodities, etc. act as an inflation hedge.  Also a crisis hedge for whatever may come.

VTI and VXUS act as the primary drivers of growth.

MSFT and AAPL I chose to hold on to because I already owned them, and didn't think it would be worth selling them just to buy more index funds.  The idea is that they will A. outperform index funds, B. do about the same as index funds, C. do slightly worse than index funds, but only slightly.  They may also survive a drawdown better than the entire market.  What's unlikely is that they severely underperform at any point.

One reason for this new portfolio is because I tried my hand at individual stock picking and confirmed the age-old wisdom that most stock pickers don't beat the market.  The market was killing me, so I decided to sell most of my individual picks. I ""sinned"" a bit by holding on to my sin stocks, but I think I make a good case for them as bond proxies.  I also don't think MSFT and AAPL are really big brain picks.  I'll be OK there.

The overall idea, however, is to stick with the index funds.

The other idea is that I don't like uncertainty and I feel more comfortable with this allocation than with 100% equities.

One final note: I'm keeping my second-tier emergency fund in series I bonds.  They have a fixed yield for their lifetime, and also an adjustable yield that changes with inflation every 6 months.  The current fixed yield is 0%, but I own them anyway because it's still better than a money market fund.  Tomorrow new yields are released, it's highly likely that they will be 0% again, but it may be worth taking a look at.

n2h9uv,,stocks,post,1619871622,"Is there any formula or calculation that would show % movement on a stock price from buy and sells?In a hypothetical world where I was the only trader, (no bid / ask), I'm curious to know if there's any way to estimate or predict how much a stock's market price would move based on ""single"" trades... Or maybe you can help point me in a direction to see if this can be determined, (if at all...).

Example, (considering the float would be a significant part of the equation)

Stock A is currently at $100, if an order for 1000 shares is filled at $100, does this do anything to the share price?

How does this change if the order was for 10,000 shares? Or 100,000 shares?

Kinda like I'm looking to figure out a delta, but instead of underlying / derivative relationship, it relates to volume / share price.

Or, does volume do nothing to the sp in the absence of the bid/ask?  Is there any math there, or is it all human emotion based on supply and demand?

Thanks for any thoughts.

**EDIT: thanks for the responses... I'd like to revise this a touch;**

If I had an imaginary currency, (that didn't allow for any arbitrage variable), and bought 100 USD, that USD would still be worth a buck a pop.

Is there any way to graph or chart the human sentiment surrounding the idea that someone might pay me more than 1 USD, (using that same imaginary currency), based on supply alone?

Working with extremes, if I only had 100 USD, I'd hypothesize that nobody would give me any more than a dollar each.

But what if I had 2 trillion?  I'd start to think that someone might be willing to offer me more than $1 each if I had 99% of the supply... (even if I wasn't taking part in the demand side by ""asking"" for $1.25 each.)  

Probably more of a psychology of economics question at this point, but I'm now curious if anyone knows if this type of behaviour has been studied, or where I'd start looking?",

n2h9uv,gwjb3zu,stocks,comment,1619873878,I'm by no means an expert at this but in my instinct tells me no. If your willing to buy it for 100 and the seller is willing to sell it at 100 there would be no need for a change. Change can only happen if the seller is willing to drop their price or the buyer is willing to pay more. If both parties are happy with the market value no change will occur.,

n2h9uv,gwjlk3j,stocks,comment,1619879626,"I feel like you’re missing something fundamental here. 

> Stock A is currently at $100

This means that the last time a trade was filled, it was for $100. Usually a stock price is a last price, or the most recent amount of money per share that happened on the exchanges. 

> if an order for 1000 shares is filled at $100, does this do anything to the share price?

No, it was filled for $100 meaning the most recent amount of money per share that happened on the exchanges was $100 per share. Unless you’re talking average fill. 

When you submit a buy order, your brokerage (whatever system they use) will try to find all sellers that match your needs. Sell order finds buyers. 

In your solo participant market, if you tried to buy something there would be no sellers... since you’re the only participant. So you wouldn’t get your order filled, sell or buy. 

This is true of any market, whether for stocks, pencils, or CS GO skins.

Edit:

There is math, usually the perceived value of the company (which is hard to determine for certain companies), as well as potential growth. Otherwise it’s just people want to buy at a price and others want to sell at a price and emotions are just shortcuts to mathing.",

n1xnv9,,stocks,post,1619800399,"Reminder to think about taking SOME profits.If you are holding your shares for the next 12+ months then disregard this post. 

This is less about micro caps (speculative plays) and more about the large cap companies. I realize how beat up EV, weed and micro caps are (though they did bounce this week).  We are at the quarter end. The big earnings week is coming to a close. Earnings were ""as expected"" even though the spin is ""exceeded expectations."" The expectation of investors was that these companies would exceed expectations which is why the beginning of the month had so many buyers.

There is going to be selling pressure over the next few days (maybe weeks). Lots of people sell after earnings simply because they don't want to hold for another three months and there are no positive catalysts in the near term to move the stock. This doesn't mean the company did anything wrong but the share price does come down. If there are enough buyers on the sidelines the prices won't move much but there will definitely be an increase of sellers out of some positions. 

Moving on to next quarter. There are a lot of supply issues and increased costs that many companies noted in their earning calls. We all know about the semi-conductor issue. Raw material costs are approaching all time highs in many sectors. Companies are raising their sale prices. The full impact of these issues won't be fully realized until the next earnings call but in preparation for that people are moving out of some of those stocks that they feel are most vulnerable. 

Also of note, as many in this forum have noted, the investments made over the ""Covid crash"" are now at their ""long term"" status and profit taking due to this will occur (is occurring) as well. ""Sell in May and go away"" is a load of crap but many people know the saying and CNBC (among others) will be using it liberally. 

These are just facts I am pointing out that are working against the market in the near term. It is your decision whether it matters or not to you. Among this will also be the ""jobs, inflation, rate hike, covid, stimulus, etc"" drama over the next few weeks (as is the usual). That can go either way and nobody knows anything for sure. There will definitely be a lot of reporting about summer travel after Covid! This will boost the re-opening plays from time to time. Also the infrastructure package will be a talking point to look forward to. 

TL;DR There will be selling pressure over the next couple of weeks which could escalate if there are not enough buyers rushing in quick enough. These buyers would hold off if ""bad news"" comes out during that time which would push share prices lower. There is definitely quite a bit of cash waiting for a buying opportunity but that usually takes an 8-10% correction to move in. It will recover over time (as always) but if you were looking to sell in the next few months there is nothing wrong with taking SOME profit at this level. If you are in it for over a year disregard this post. 

I am not telling you what to do. I am reminding you to think about what to do. You are responsible for your own decisions. Good luck out there!",

The market fell on Friday after a record-setting session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) pulling back after recording fresh intraday highs. Market participants continue to assess the slew of corporate earnings reports and recent, encouraging economic data. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Shares of Amazon (AMZN) outperformed the market, jumping to a new record high after reporting blowout Q1 earnings fueled by sustained demand, showing great strength even as the economy in the US begins to reopen. Shares of Twitter, on the other hand, sunk after the company fell short of estimates, disappointing investors who hoped the company would show a strong pick-up in ad sales like peers Snap (SNAP) and Facebook (FB).

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. 
* Personal income jumped 21.1% in March over February, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. This came in better than the 20.3% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Shares of Nio outperformed the broader market, trading roughly 2% higher after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.

Such as, reduce need for invasive mandatory ventilation, immune to mutant strains, reduce hospital stay ie. More bed availability, fast reoxygenation response, fully administered in 1 day, cost savings on healthcare, etc. I want to put eyes on this because it seems that it’s getting silenced from HF shorts.

Amazon released first-quarter results on Thursday that trounced analysts’ expectations.


Amazon shares climbed as much as 5% in extended trading Thursday after the company released its first-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street’s expectations for earnings and revenue. 

Here’s how the e-commerce giant fared, relative to analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv:

Earnings: $15.79 per share vs. $9.54 per share expected
Revenue: $108.52 billion vs. $104.47 billion expected

Few companies have benefited from the pandemic-fueled surge of online shopping as much as Amazon. The company notched record profits and revenue last year, while CEO Jeff Bezos announced earlier this month that Amazon crossed more than 200 million Prime subscribers, up from 150 million at the start of 2020.

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

n1gpdx,,stocks,post,1619737398,"NIO is ramping up for big thingsNIO Inc. (NIO) is announcing the beginning of construction of NeoPark, a smart electric vehicle industry park it is co-developing with the Hefei government, ahead of the Chinese automaker's quarterly earnings release after the close Thursday. 

What Happened: Work on NeoPark has kicked off, Nio said in a Thursday press release.
The opening ceremony was attended by several officials from Anhui province, where Hefei is located, as well as William Li, Nio's founder, chairman and CEO.

Nio's China headquarters are situated in Hefei. The collaboration agreement with the Hefei municipal government for NeoPark was signed in early February.

NeoPark is conceived as a smart EV industry cluster, encompassing R&D of vehicles, core parts and components and autonomous driving. It was envisioned to evolve as a pioneering innovation chain with global competitiveness and a hub for hundreds of key supporting industries and a highly clustered, full-fledged industry chain, the company said.

The 16,950-acre park features three main function areas — smart manufacturing, R&D and living space, and Eco park. NeoPark will likely contribute to peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, according to the company.
The park, according to company, will accommodate over 10,000 R&D personnel and 40,000 technical workers. It's expected to have an annual production capacity of 1 million vehicles and 100 GWh. The annual gross output from the park is expected to reach 500 billion yuan ($77.3 billion).
Why It's Important: Nio has embarked on a broad push to drive volumes as it comes up against fierce competition in a crowded EV market. The company has announced innovation in battery technology, charging infrastructure and services, while also announcing new models.

The company confirmed Wednesday that it is setting up operations in Norway, terming it as the first leg of its international expansion.
The investment in Neo Park is also seen as a payback from Nio to the Hefei city, which bailed it out with financial assistance when the company was running out of cash in 2019.",['LEG']

n25apc,,stocks,post,1619822487,"I would like to get some opinion on my ROTH strategyHi guys. I would likes to see if you have any opinion on my strategy outlined below. 

About 75% of my total portfolio is in 401k: Vanguard index funds (not changing)

Another 15% or so in a taxable account: VTI (also not changing)

And the rest 10% is in Roth. Obviously will grow it but $6k a year limit stunts it’s growth. 

Now... this Roth is where I allow myself some active trading and I really want to diversify away from big tech. I hold so much APPL and MSFT through my index funds that I don’t want that in my Roth. 

My two big bets in my Roth is RDS (Shell) and VWAPY/POAHY. Both for similar reasons: I expect Shell to be a major player in green/renewable energy and VW to be a major player in EV. But both companies have established business (oil and gas cars) so not new players with lots of unknowns. 

Depending on how you look at it, they may be considered undervalued or at least fair valued compared to some insane valuations there. 

I don’t really care about dividends but it doesn’t hurt that both also pay some. 

So I guess my strategy with both of them is to hopefully see some serious growth and returns in green/EV, while having some level of stability (hopefully).  I am betting on them in the green/EV growth base ICLN or PLUG. 

I really welcome any criticism!",['MSFT']

As for Shell & VW, I personally don't see anything special going on with them, though I haven't looked into them. Shell, I have a hard time believing they're doing wonderful things with emerging technology when they've spent the last twenty years trying to quash it.

My sense this that in spite of this, we might see a bit of inflation filtering through as a result of lifestyle inflation where people make up for lost time and enjoy more recreational services than previously, though I’m not expecting a massive ‘big bang’ of spending either, particularly not from those who saved the most.

Backstory - Got into investing at the start of the year. Rode the gamestop train and was immensly annoyed at the manipulation taking place on it. Got out for a £5k profit.

Got back on the gamestop train and am sitting at a £200 loss.

Got onto the meme train of a certain stock running this week that deals with Lidar tech. Had 5k profit, was too greedy, got tied up and couldnt check my profile, ended up with a 2k loss.

I really struggle with taking profits. It's probably greed. This is the biggest part of my investing life that I need to work on. I always think ""hmmm 20% profit, thats good, but 25% is better"". This mindset screws me every time, to the point I end up taking a loss, or taking a tiny profit because I held on and lost the big profit.

On the back of this week, I threw a yolo at Amazon 2 hours before earnings and made about £600 with an £18,000 play. Sold the next day.

Now, this next thing is what really pissed me off - When I first started investing, I wanted to do my own DD.

I found a British company called Scirocco Energy. It was a pennystock, trading around the $1 mark, but they had a couple of things I liked. Some mining operations set up for a few years down the line, and it looked pretty slick with some reasonable figures. It was my very first investment, and I put about £30 in, just so I could say I was ""in the market"".

It traded sideways FOREVER. Until all of a sudden, the other day, it went skyward, 60% in a single day, On no news at all. it was obvious it was being pumped and dumped. I sold and took my tiny $16 profit.

It irked me though. Someone has found this stock, pumped it up to high heaven and is in the process of dumping it. There's zero regulation. Nobody gives a toss. Nobody cares.

Look at gamestop. Brokers literally turned off the market for a couple of days and caused retail a world of pain.

The mavis was another glorified pumped up memestock.

It just stinks.

So, I'm kinda done with this short term investing.

I'm looking for a long term investment, something I can throw that £18,000 back in and do a Buffet on it. Leave it for a year or two and see what happens. Something which is only gonna go up, even if it is at a very slow rate. Low risk, low reward is fine by me, because my anxiety can't take any more of the huge changes in price on meme stocks.

Suggestions anyone? Stick it all back in amazon? Microsoft? Some ETF that i'm unaware of? Maybe even BRK.B?

I hope this doesn't come across as salty ranting tears because I lost money, in reality, my £30k profile has probably broken even (maybe a tiny loss) since I started investing, but it's really opened my eyes to how it all works, and how much of a casino it all is.

I've got a couple of meme-ish long positions which hopefully might come good this year, but I need some stability in my life.","['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'BRK.B']"

EPD is widely considered to be one of the best managed companies around, and they pay a consistent dividend to boot. CNX is a domestic natural gas producer to monitor, too. Earnings were great, and they have room to grow. 

I think TSM at 117 is an absolute steal given your profile. That is a very fair price for them, and analysts agree it’s likely an undervalued stock. 

Lockheed at 380 is still a good deal, too. They pay a dividend and have a proven track record with room to grow on top of their current valuation.

3. I want to get to 20k passive income and retire because I hate work and my expenses right now are about 10k a year. 
4. Next 10 years
5. I don't like risk at all. 
6. I bought my house years ago with cash and it's worth about 320-350k now. I have 40k S&P/Delta/Southwest/Kraft Heinz, and 90k in the savings.  
7. No debt. I own my car and house. 
8. My self employed situation is super unstable. I'm not sure how well it will recover from covid. So far not looking good. 

Basically, I'm sick of work. I've hated it ever since my first job at 17 working at Circuit City. I want to live in a quiet, safe rural town with lots of hiking nearby and travel around with a camper hiking and exploring the wilderness while playing video games. I have 0 ambition outside of that. This is the type of life that makes me happiest. The reason I have so much saved is because I've pretty much lived that life for 10 years and expenses are low because of it. I just like cheap travel and gaming. 

How can I get to around 20k passive income and just do this forever? I've considered picking up a car sales job since I'm great in sales and just grinding out a few hundred more grand to invest or buy rental properties with, but i'd rather not manage rental properties so I'd need a company to do it and they take a cut.

Also I really want to move since the house itself cost 3.5k yearly in HOA and taxes, which is a huge chunk of my expenses.","['SPGI', 'KHC']"

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['DOW', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'SPGI']"

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

&#x200B;

Obligatory disclaimer: I don't own Ford, not a fan of the sector as an investment.","['GOOGL', 'TSLA']"

n1ttyy,,investing,post,1619789266,"$NAPA - Valued at a discountI came across this stock via a low PE screener and realized that I am already familiar with many of their products. They're in the alcoholic beverages industry, own vineyards, and produce a wide portfolio of wine brands sold in 50 countries. I'm a big fan of Decoy for producing cheaply priced but great tasting reds. 

They had their IPO last month and their price seems to be stabilizing after yoyoing between $16-20. Facts:

* Market Cap: $2.1b
* Shares: $18.58
* PEG: 0.01
* **PE: 0.04**

This seems like an absolute steal. Competitors in the beverages industry have an average PE of 32.5 and PEG of 0.05 (per TD Ameritrade analytics, anyway). Its a profitable company that has great margins.

The primary downside is their tiny market share in a competitive industry. In 2020, their total revenue was $270mil, versus the industry total of $326**bil** (0.08%). 

What else am I missing? Why is $NAPA valued at such a discount?

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

Invest at your own risk. The above scenario is incredibly risky and a slight deviation in your math will bankrupt your account, but if correct, it’s a big payday and scaleable with a ton of margin if you choose that risk.",
n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA. Ironically this probably sets up a good entry to short bubble stocks, of which there are plenty. Be careful of ones with weekly expiries and high short interest; these are prone to gamma manipulation by larger players. It's a game and if there is money to be made in a short squeeze it will be done. 

There is stuff like ARKK which doesn't necessarily have 0 fundamentals but has very high valuations; SPACs which are mostly frauds (e.g. NKLA), meme stocks like MVIS and GME. Go for put spreads instead of outright shorting if you can find a good entry. 

You could go for a more balanced approach and diversify your short book. Solely from valuation you can short MSFT/APPL against long GOOG/FB and I reckon there are many more interesting pairs out there. But there is so much money on the table if the bubble stocks do burst. The call-buying from retail is slowly diminishing as the economy is reopening up; interest rates are rising and I think this is probably a good opportunity to set up some shorts if you can stomach large drawdowns (and you do need conviction to believe that stocks will trade towards their fair value over time).","['MSFT', 'TSLA', 'FB', 'ARKK']"

n1i2a5,gwgp7qi,investing,comment,1619812504,"A lot of negative sentiment on TWTR in this thread. 10:1 ratio of negative comments? As expected since the stock is down +15% the last few weeks and down +25% from it's peak a few months ago. 

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']"

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Quoting from Michael Pettis, who is always astute, and is a reasonably non-biased source on China's economy. [Read thread here](https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1387831939353153537).

>This process can be highly self-reinforcing as it forces property developers to cut back further on operations, and so alienate even more deposits. Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.

>Second, Beijing will have to choose either to let households take the loss or to force banks to step in and make them whole. The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.

>For many years we've seen that ""deleveraging"" in China has meant reducing leverage in one part of the economy while increasing it in another. This isn't incidental. It is fundamental to the way the growth model works. ""

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",

n172e0,,investing,post,1619710688,"Alkemy and the Rebirth of Plastic Recycling TechSince the 1960s, plastics have been a ubiquitous feature of modern civilization.  Unfortunately, plastic bags, wrappings and disposable cups are wreaking havoc on the environment, given their high concentration of petroleum, tendency to interfere with wildlife and inability to decompose in landfills.  If a solution isn’t found, plastics will wreck natural habitats, choke streams and pollute groundwater.  In other words, they’ll strangle the geosystem to death.

The solution for a sustainable way to use plastics seems to be recycling. However, at present, only about 1/10 of plastics are recycled.  A big part of such a small fraction is that no one has found a profitable and efficient way to recycle dirty plastics into value-added goods.

Until now, that is.  Alkemy Solutions just had their IPO, and these guys look poised to take the world of recycling and cleantech by storm.  Alkemy came up with a unique process for the recycling of plastic bags, a usual non-starter for most recycling companies acrossthe world.

Plastic bags recycling is economically non-viable and global plants won’t touch it despite government incentives.

Alkemy has both solved the economics aspect of this issue by making the recycling of dirty plastics a money-making machine.  In fact, the process is so efficient that Alkemy’s plant undertakes both recycling and the production of finished products from the plastics they salvage. The unique vertically integrated structure solves the problem of finding companies that will manufacture items from recycled plastics and saves the planet in the process.

In a recent trial run in Israel, Alkemy cornered 70% of the market for recycled construction materials, polyethylene surfaces, and water-proof sealants.

The company is developing a wide menu of products and additional applications for its recycled plastics. As they gain traction, reduced costs and global concern over the environment make for strong projections of a titanic increase in demand for Alkemy’s recycled plastics.  This is an opportunity to invest in the planet’s future.  Read up on em, do your own DD for crying out loud, but take a look, Alkemy really seems like a special one.

n13d9f,,investing,post,1619699725,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval ProcessWelcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

3. Biden's targetting of ""like kind exchange"" tax deferrals won't affect REITs, but investors that invested in real estate directly may have less of a reason to do so over just investing in REITs.

&#x200B;

REITS are riskier, and return less.  theres no point in the last 20 years where REITS had a 3 month window where their annualized vol was below SPX, and their return was above it.  same for 6 months, same for 12 months.  so sure, maybe its possible, but considering that REITs have literally never done this, theres no chance it suddenly will.

n1awok,,investing,post,1619721222,"Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings Apple is a great long term buy according to my opinion. My Portfolio is 100% Apple. I believe this company has so many more avenues to venture into and maintain healthy growth over the following decade. I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",['AAPL']

But this is the best and most important part? If you don't want to get into your DD then how about amusing me a bit with these questions:

* How do feel about the risk of weak returns since Brazil has been in a decade of economic down turn? Historically Brazil has had booms that market them look like they'll reach developed status only to bust back into developing status.

* Have you factored in the problems with inflation and continued currency weakness? US might be printing like crazy, but LatAm currencies are experiencing inflation not only against their own goods/services but also against the dollar.

* Are you factoring the various troubles of Bolsonaro government having immediate and long term impacts?

* How are you so sure those individual stocks will do so well? Investing in Brazil is already risky as is with it likely being outside the circle of competence of most people. The added individual stock picks only increases those risks. Why not invest in an ETF like EWZ?

* What makes you think that these Brazilian stocks or even a Brazilian ETF can outperform US stocks when historically speaking the US & S&P has beaten Brazil and the Brazilian top stocks in basically every time range be it 1yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, or 50yr?

While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”","['DOV', 'PEP', 'SNA', 'DE', 'TEL', 'WHR', 'CE', 'KO']"

* Great studios are very far and few. To develop something like the Witcher series and gain such widespread critical acclaim is not easy. It takes a lot of money, talent, and momentum to be able to build such competence as a developer, that's valuable.
* Essentially CD Projekt Red benefits from being HQ'd in Eastern Europe. These games require an army to develop. Well, eastern developers are a cheap and talented army.
* The games of today are services, they are not one-off products. Cyber Punk will be improved upon, and over time the developers will hash out all the bugs and the game will improve.
* The best time to release a new IP is during the release of a new generation of consoles. It matters less whether the game is any good, the key is to make the IP a thing (one game is not the IP). As far as I am concerned, every gamer has heard of this IP now. All it takes are some critical reviews of the next installments to completely change the media storyline.
* CD Projekt Red made all of Cyber Punk's development costs back before the game was even released in preorders. They are far from losing money at this point.",['IP']
n133p8,,investing,post,1619698785,"DD: Mother's Day is May 9th - Go Get Her Some Nice $FLWS1-800-FLOWERS, or FLWS, just smashed their 3rd quarter earnings, so I wanted to write up a bit of due diligence on the company. In spirit of today's DD, here's: [a piece of digital art representing the Tulip bubble of the 1600's](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0564/6755/4489/files/TULIPScolorSHOP.jpg?v=1619009285). 

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods & Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March & September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA & ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

I currently max out my 401K and have about 80K in there right now. (Started a little late maxing it out)

I do not have an IRA . 

Don't have a ton of debt, maybe 1K on a credit card and I lease my car. My wife's car is paid off.

I just opened an E\*trade Core Portfolio account to transfer 15K of that 55K into it to hopefully grow. Should I go this route or are there better options to grow my money?

mzn9py,,investing,post,1619526251,"What do you think broad market returns will average over the next 20 years?When retirement planning or just choosing between different investment opportunities we all have to make some assumptions about what the long-term broad market outlook is. With a difference of 2% growth rates over the next 20 years there can be massive differences in the end value of your investment.


The historical CAGR (with dividends) of the S&P500 over the last X years (ending Dec 31 2020) is as follows:

100 Years: 10.46%

90: 9.92%

80: 11.23%

70: 11.54%

60: 10.27%

50: 10.76%

40: 12.01%

30: 10.24%

20: 6.59%

10: 13.99%

Source: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm


Knowing this, what do you assume the broad market will have for an annualized growth rate over the next 20 years or so? I'm thinking along the lines of the total S&P500 return, VTSAX, or similar. Why?


I realize nobody can truly know what to expect, but I'm asking what assumption you would make based on historical norms, future outlook, macroeconomic factors, etc.


Personally, I assume a conservative rate of return of 7%. I do this for several reasons. First, I would rather underestimate how much I will have in 20 years and be pleasantly surprised when the return is more. Second, I think macroeconomic headwinds are coming compared to the previous decades that will result in slower overall growth.",['SPGI']
mzn9py,gw2hafy,investing,comment,1619541843,"For what it's worth, despite many on Reddit saying it would be a wild guess, the idea of forecasting returns within a rough degree of accuracy is pretty well accepted in mainstream finance.  After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

There's a bunch more, obviously, but those are some highlights.  I would encourage anyone who genuinely wants to absorb some information to read the [full report](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/ltcma-full-report.pdf).  It's a bit long, but it's full of fantastic insights.

E: it should be noted that JPM isn't the only institution doing this - most banks release similar reports, even the fan favorite Vanguard has long term market assumptions that largely reflect these, and so did Jack Bogle before his passing.  The reason I mention it is to note that the idea of return forecasting isn't some sort of crazy complex finance marketing - it's just an execution of some basic macroeconomics and math.",['JPM']

mzx6w6,,investing,post,1619553654,"Trying to get future valuation based on future estimated Revenues for fuboTV...comments appreciated 

I'm looking to get a valuation on FUBOTV based on my estimate Subs growth out to 2025. This is how I have approached it. Can I get some comments on this please as to is it a valid approach or not? Suggestions of alternates...

P/S(TTM) = 4 Stock Price is $22Current subs as of Dec 2020 - 545K - 41% growth

**Streaming Subscriptions**

Assume growth is at the same level for next 5 years:

Sub Dec 2021 - 770K -> Sub Dec 2022 - 1.085M -> Sub Dec 2023 - 1530M-> Sub Dec 2024 - 2.16M-> Sub Dec 2025 - **3.043M**

Assume we only get revenue at the base subscription level to be conservative:

$65 x 3M x 12 = $2.4B

**Online Sportsbook & Fantasy Sports**

Draftkings reported $65 per unique monthly user in Q4 2020. They have 1.5 million of these. I am giving FUBO 1/3 of this per active users to be prudent as we just don't know yet what sort of money FUBO will bring in for Fantasy Sports and Sports Betting.

By 2025 with 3 Million users getting an estimated $22 on average per user per month

3m users x $22 x 12 months = $792M per annum

**Ad Revenue**

We assume FUBO can work the Ad Revenue to at least Hulu's level of 34%(Youtube is at 47%) of subscriber revenue by 2025

Subscriber Revenue in 2025 estimates as above at $2.4B \* 34% = $816M

**Total Revenue by 2025**

$2.4B + $0.792B + $0.816B = $4.008B

P/S(TTM) = 4 Assume it will double given growth(which is a conservative measure) to 8

Sales = $4B

Shares Outstanding = 140.16 million

P/4B=8

P=32B/140.16M

FUBO Price as of 2025 based on assumptions above = $228.31

Is this realistic to attempt a valuation going backwards on Price/Sale ratio?

Thanks, No-Ball7005",['MMM']
mzx6w6,gw63iyq,investing,comment,1619616175,"FYI Sales ≠ Revenue.  And why aren't you using Discounted Cash Flow?  Nobody uses sales or revenue to determine price because of all the accounting sleight of hand that affects these figures.  This is why operating cash flow is central to securities pricing.

Operating income has been negative for five straight years.  Operating cash flow has been negative for four of the last five years.

Via free cash flow, you get a fair value of roughly -$40 per share.

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this? 

I don't wanna seem conspiratorial but it'd seem that most institutional investors have a vested interest in holding GE.

mz77xi,,investing,post,1619469066,"New guidelines for DD posts**This is a follow up to /u/Greytoc's post here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mw4jei/psa_stock_promotion_and_suspicious_stock/

I'll make this short - we all have seen the strong uptick in ""DD"" posts on this and every single other financial subreddit.  A significant portion of these posts are coming from either new users or suspicious accounts (extensive history posting porn, no prior engagement in financial subs, etc).  It's our understanding that a significant portion of these posts are the result of interested third parties compensating people to raise visibility of a stock on Reddit.  

-----

**Effective immediately, we are implementing the following guidelines:**

DD (Due Diligence) posts, for purposes below, are any long form posts reporting on specific stocks.  Special attention to anything between a 500M and 10B Market cap, as that's where we've seen a lot of this activity.

**1) If a user is posting their DD post across multiple subreddits it's going to be removed from here.** 

**2) If a DD post is coming from a new user, or one with little to no history participating in any investment/finance subs it's probably going to get removed**

**3) DD posts must include a legitimate bear case, not lip service to risks, but a genuine examination of risks and adverse outcomes.  It must also include actual financials - cashflows, balance sheet items, etc.**  You don't need to do a full valuation model like you're an analyst, but you do need to discuss the actual financials of the stock. 

Ultimately this is just a framework - because much of the interpretation of intent here is subjective the mods may still remove a DD post on a given stock if things just feel wrong.  I think the constraints on who can post DD should be sufficient to prevent much of the spam/shill type DD posts we've been seeing.

------

**In addition I'm working on an automod sticky that would replace our normal new thread sticky** - this would warn users that DD posts are not to be taken at face value, and that the potential for misleading statements about a security to be made on Reddit is quite high. 

We chatted a bit over this and the above requirements are where we landed, we're still open to feedback or suggestions - the ultimate goal isn't to prevent people from talking about stocks they're interested in - it's to prevent bad actors from utilizing reddit to drive interest in stocks they may have financial interest in.    

People are still free to make discussion posts on a given stock, but those should at least show that you've done a starting bit of research on the stock.  But we won't scrutinize something like ""what are your thougts on XYZ, here's what I came across"" nearly as much as ""Full review on this 2B mkt cap generic chapstick manufacturer, it's set to explode"".  Ultimately this shouldn't impact anyone looking to just chat stocks in good faith - we're only aiming to get rid of a lot of these super suspicious posts that have popped up post GME.     

Unrelated: We've eased up the automod constraints on advice/beginner posts to hopefully encourage more complex questions to come through.",

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR']

You misspelled detriment. 

From the perspective of somebody that actually holds crypto in a wallet, not one that just speculates on it on robinhood, how would everything you hold and every transaction you ever make be in any way beneficial? Transparent blockchains are good for validation systems, but they are the worst possible thing that can be applied to any form of currency if you want to maintain any level of privacy whatsoever. This is only a benefit if you are speculating on movements of whales and is absolutely not good if you realize that your movement can be tracked in real time too...",

i’ve been building my roth ira for the past few weeks using my saved up salary. my plan is to have an extremely aggressive portfolio as i’m still very young and can afford to lose money short term. so far i have $4k put into the ira, so only $2k left for 2021. i make just over $200 a week from my job and my current expenses are quite low so i’ll have the money to finish it in no time. here’s my allocations so far:

42% ARKK

38% VOO (0% contributed yet)

10% ARKX

5% VXUS

5% VWO

i haven’t put any money into VOO yet, as it’s the remaining $2k and i wanted to diversify a little before dumping money into the s&p 500. 

am i on the right track? part of me thinks i’m an idiot for owning the shares i own and part of me thinks in 40 years i’ll consider myself a genius...","['SPGI', 'ARKK']"

my953u,,investing,post,1619360105,"Feedback post: we're considering revising/specifying the rules on advice/spitball postsThe moderation pendulum swings all over the place, but I fear it's a bit too far on constricting right now.  We haven't actually changed any of our base rules, but have tightened up on some in the post GME deluge of dumb posts. 

I know /u/greytoc just made a post on DD guidelines, we're just about ready to roll out some new firm guidelines on what DD is appropriate and what is not.  So stay tuned for that.  

So, that said the volume of posts has decreased significantly here, a lot are being removed for very good reasons, but we're still thinking of ways to strike a nice balance (to be clear - quality of discussion is and will continue to be our primary goal with any rule).  I regularly check the automod removal logs and 99% of the posts being removed are frankly just really generic advice requests or basic questions. 

That said, I'd like to formulate some formal guidelines for differentiating between a post that should be in a daily thread and one that can have it's own thread.  I'd like for sufficiently complex topics to be able to generate insightful discussion - this is an inherently subjective threshold so someone's gonna be mad about their post not making the cut, but I think formalizing some guidelines should help.  

So, I was discussing this with /u/Emc87, and our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here.  But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.  

This obviously creates a lot of room for interpretation - I've seen enough people in modmail arguing that ""how do I buy stock"" is a valid discussion topic that would help many people to know that we're not going to make everyone happy here.  But I would like to see what thoughts everyone has as to putting a semi-formal framework on these ideas, so that we can point to something when deciding which posts will be sent to the daily threads and which can have their own post.",['GOOGL']

mym15t,,investing,post,1619398704,"Tax it now? Or tax it later?I’ve always heard the order of investing for retirement should go as follows:
Contribute to Employer Tax Deferred Plan up to the match amount
Max out Roth IRA
Back to Employer Plan and max it out
Contribute to Taxable accounts

That’s what we’ve been working on for the last three years. My wife has a 403(b) and a Roth IRA. I haven’t had an employee plan, so I’ve just been maxing out my Roth IRA and that’s it. 

I know the assumption people rely on for this plan is that their tax bracket in retirement will be higher than what it is now, hence taking the taxes now in lieu of taking them in retirement. 

I just got a job that offers a SIMPLE IRA (tax deferred account similar to 401(k)) with a 3% employer match. 

Our adjusted gross income last year (married filing jointly) was around 95k. 

Is this still the right plan to follow? Or should things be switched around and focus more on tax deferred plans? And other than just pure opinion or things you’ve heard before, what’s the reason for what you’re suggesting?",

mym15t,gvxb4h5,investing,comment,1619442134,"The advice you've outlined is pretty common in /r/personalfinance which tends to be skewed to young, early career, or pre-career demographics or people working in a career with limited/stagnated earnings. Roth is a good option for these workers because they tend to be in lower tax brackets now, but with potential for higher income in the future and in retirement. Additionally, Roth IRA's allow removal of contributions (but not growth) without penalty which provides flexibility in how the money is used which younger workers value. 

If you're an older, professional, mid/late career worker, in a career where earnings tend to increase with experience and responsibility, you will tend to get more benefit from pre-tax account contributions. These workers tend to be in higher tax brackets and have income that exceeds their planned retirement income. These workers should prioritize 401k, HSA. Deductible IRA contributions generally are not an option due to the low income cap. 

The rule of thumb I've seen is that if you're in the bottom two tax brackets you should prioritize after-tax accounts (Roth, Roth 401k). If you're above the bottom two tax brackets, prioritize pre-tax (401k, HSA) and after maxing these, use Roth IRA, then taxable accounts.",

mydjye,gvxq9vn,investing,comment,1619449452,"Look, you are free to disregard this, but I'm hoping to save you a lot of pain.  For what it's worth, I'm currently the CEO of a biotech startup that's raised $30MM.

If you don't meet the accredited investor definition (by wealth, not certification) and you're not playing an active role in managing whatever you're looking at investing in, at least one of the following are true: you should not be investing in that business, and if that business is interested in having you as an investor, *nobody* should be investing in it.

The rules are there to protect investors who can't afford to lose significant amounts of money from high-risk, illiquid investments where there are significant information gaps between investors and management due to the lack of formal reporting.  It's not just that you're risking money that may disappear; it's that you're doing it without the ability to have the market setting the price, analysts reviewing financials, and real due diligence.

Moreover, the rules are there because, to have you as an investor, these companies need you to invest *a lot* *more* than you could lose comfortably if you don't meet the thresholds.  When I raised the seed into my current company, minimum investment was $50k.  I wanted a clean cap table with investors who wouldn't be pinched if it took a long time to get out (on average, that's 5-10 YEARS) and who knew what they were signing up for.  A company who is ok with someone investing $5k-$10k that isn't a founder and is marginally accredited either a) isn't raising enough money to scale; b) is going to have a very messy cap table; or c) is delusional or lying about capital needs or business potential.  Likely all three.

If you want to get involved with exciting startup investments, go be a part of an exciting startup.  Start one yourself, or find some founders and offer to help, or just get a job at a startup.  But if you're not accredited, you shouldn't be investing in these things -- the potential for loss is massive and you're not going to have enough firepower or financial ballast to make much of a difference or weather the rough times.",

mxaojd,,investing,post,1619230712,"The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail InvestorEDIT: I added the [MacroVoices podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDIifbY71g) where Chris Cole goes over the Dragon Portfolio. I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&P 500. This tends to outperform the S&P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.","['LEG', 'SPGI']"

mwvqvk,,investing,post,1619185962,"Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunityLeave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

mx1aby,,investing,post,1619201124,"My Alteryx (AYX) DD: This isn't a dip to buy, it's part of their long decline.After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to [instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664513-alteryx-shares-drop-after-chief-revenue-officer-resigns).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, [an analyst](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/alteryx-s-1-breakdown-4a711683f6c) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares.","['MMM', 'NDAQ']"

Alteryx were not particularly happy when they found out but this wasn't technically against their T&Cs. 

Alteryx desktop was fun to play with and tableau integrations etc are useful but it's just not practically scalable for any ML imo.

1. Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power BI can easily do all the of the same data transformation/modeling/blending/reporting without buying any licenses. It can't mimic Alteryx's data science packages but does any professional actually use those instead of python/R?
2. Alteryx has much friendlier UI/UX but the MS Office team has been doing an incredible job with Office 365 making it super user friendly and powerful. I could easily see them creating a slick O365 product for codeless data blending and analytics. Or just tie Power Apps, Flow, and Data Factory together into a single, simple UX. 
3. Adding an Alteryx copycat to the O365 family with out-of-the-box connectivity to all the other O365 services seems like a huge perk. Seamless integration between Excel, One Drive, Power BI, and Active Directory sounds super nice to me.

Anecdotally, I'm Alteryx Core certified and fluent in M and python. A lot of times for data transformation I'll go with power query just because the native Excel integration makes it quick and easy. For more advanced jobs I'll go to python for the flexibility.

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive. 

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price. 

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of  growth figures is required to get great returns.",['GOOGL']

mx7aye,,investing,post,1619218741,"Ideas for investing in growth in the sunbeltThe southern US is growing much faster than the rest of the US, especially places like the Phoenix MSA and Texas Triangle. Of the top 10 most populous cities in the US, the only four that have experienced more than 10% population growth in the past decade have been in Texas and Arizona. Austin in particular (#11th most populous US city) grew 24% in the past decade and is probably the hottest real estate market in the US right now. Anyone who lives in these areas, especially Texas, knows how how many people from places like California are going to Texas for cheaper CoL amongst other things. I'd provide links but I'm not sure if they'd get my post deleted by AutoMod - city/state growth is readily available.

That being said, real estate is the most obvious investment opportunity to profit off of this demographic shift. My only exposure to real estate as a 25 year old just starting my career is FundRise and REITs - FundRise has a clear focus on southern real estate, especially in TX, and with enough research you can find REITs (like MAA, CPT, BRT) that invest primarily in the sunbelt region.

Other ideas I've had are power/utilities companies like PNW. One might even combine this demographic perspective with climate change speculation - people are moving to hot places that are going to keep getting hotter; air conditioning stocks like CARR may be a good choice?

So form my perspective, I can only really think REITs/utilities/AC. I wanted to give my own two cents on how to profit off of this growth but also see if people here had other ideas as to specific sectors or stocks (or non-stock market ideas) and spark discussion. I'm also curious if people here have ideas for investing in other demographic trends such as aging population.","['PNW', 'MAA', 'CARR']"

As long as there is more liquidity moving into indices than moving out they will continue to benefit. But they will continue to increase in valuation as there is more demand and at some point those valuations will be a drag on future returns if the business performance can’t keep up. 

Think of tobacco stocks having the opposite effect. Nobody wants to own them anymore so their multiples have collapsed and are likely to be perpetually “cheap”.

mwx0rd,,investing,post,1619189538,"Enbridge: Critical Infrastructure in the Green RevolutionThe green revolution is upon us. Enbridge is a critical energy infrastructure business known for transporting oil and natural gas. It also has a sizeable renewable segment. What you might not be aware of is how well that stacks up in the renewables space and how such companies are including non-renewable power in their total outputs.

For capacity context, the International Renewable Energy Agency released its [2020 Renewable Capacity Statistics ](https://www.irena.org/publications/2021/March/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2021)which provides insights into the sector as a whole.

 I have ranked Enbridge with various renewable companies in terms of **current net capacity** (the maximum output of electricity a generator can produce under ideal conditions) **minus natural gas capacity,** which[ according to the International Renewable Energy Agency is an alternative fossil fuel. ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Apr/IRENA_Report_GET_2018.pdf)Definitions for what constitute *renewable* natural gas vary and you will see further examples below, but this number is included where available. The only outputs considered are strictly renewable: solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. I have not included energy generation statistics (how much energy is actually output) because this varies based on operating capacity and conditions (eg. weather events will lower output).  


All data has been sourced from the latest publicly available ESG or Annual Reports and provided below. 

 

|**Company**|**Net Renewable Capacity (MW)**|
|:-|:-|
|Brookfield Renewable|18,884|
|Innergex Renewable|2,742|
|Boralex|2,455|
|Enbridge|1,727|
|Algonquin|1,456|
|Northland Power|1,323|
|Transalta Renewables|1,619\*\*|

\*\* \*\*Transalta Renewables as at Dec 31 2020 listed only gross renewable MW and not net, which is significantly lower. 

&#x200B;

 **Brookfield Renewable:** by far the largest output capacity and zero natural gas facilities. The majority of net capacity comes from Hydro and Wind. 

 **Innergex Renewable:** The majority of net capacity comes from Wind and Hydro. Again no natural gas. 

 **Boralex:** 82% of net capacity is derived from Wind. Least diversified of the group. 

 **Enbridge:** Majority of renewable capacity generated by Wind. Renewables represent 3% of EBITDA and appx. $200MM in annual contracted revenues. 

 Combined Current Renewable Power Generation outputs:  
• 1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;  
• 255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;  
• 80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation 

 **Algonquin**: The latest data from 2021 sources showed FY19 figures. You will see coal listed here: the Asbury coal plant was closed in March 2020. Furthermore, a significant portion of their capacity is from natural gas (50%), which is from non-renewable sources and thus not included. 

 **Northland Power:** Included in their total output is ‘efficient’ natural gas, which accounts for \~60% of net capacity. While the outcome is reduced emissions, it is still not a renewable source and therefore not included in total renewable capacity. 

 **Transalta Renewables:** Similar to Algonquin and Northland, a significant portion of capacity is from natural gas (\~60%). I was unable to find updated net capacity statistics, which are significantly lower than gross, thus TA ranked last. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net capacity is an important metric in measuring where a renewable company stands, but it is not the only one. Revenues are impacted by total output and pricing, of which the weather events in Texas provided an eye-opening example. Nevertheless, what we see from the above comparison is that Enbridge is already well positioned amongst common North American “renewable” names, albeit far behind big players like Brookfield. Looking through the above company ESG and Annual Reports highlighted further forays into traditional renewable sources, while also noting investments in **renewable natural gas**. Let’s not forget the critical role Enbridge will play in RNG transmission alongside their [own RNG production.](https://www.enbridgegas.com/Natural-Gas-and-the-Environment/Enbridge-A-Green-Future/Renewable-Natural-Gas) 

 Make of this information what you will. The market is currently discounting their business with the secular oil decline, and not fully considering Enbridge’s ability to innovate and partner alongside a growing global energy infrastructure network, particularly in the NG/RNG space. I am bullish.

In the current environment (hard to build new pipelines) these assets become more valuable.

This is a HUGE deal for type 1 diabetics (apart from Tandem's t:slim X2 which currently has a feature BasalIQ but this has tubing so not wireless (https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/providers/products/basal-iq)). Having your insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor communicate and automatically adjust is heading towards the direction of creating an 'artificial pancreas' and makes managing diabetes so much better.

mw4jei,,investing,post,1619097477,"PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendationsFor those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

32, turning 33 in July. United States. 

>Are you employed/making income? How much?

Unemployed, but unemployment is giving me 15/hr in a 40 hour equivalent period. 

>What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)

Retirement and make extra money. 

>What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

I want to retire at 65. About 32 years.

70% safe.

Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?

No debts or expenses. I currently have 15K in my savings account and 3K in my checking accounts. 


Yes, I just started a IRA Roth with fidelity. I currently put 1000 dollars in the 2020 year on a target date fund 2050 (FIPFX).

> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


>He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said.","['GOOGL', 'TWTR', 'FB', 'AAPL']"

mvwh0z,,investing,post,1619062572,"Reconciling the Intelligent Investor with Current Bond yields.Ok, I’ve just finished The Intelligent Investor for the first time. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with investing as Graham defines it (as opposed to speculating) and the current situation with bond yields with his advice that you should keep at least 25% allocated because of the potential for things to change in the future. 

I’ve also been a fan of Ray Dalio’s advice, and recently read his post on avoiding bonds altogether.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio)

These two thought streams are seemingly at odds, and the best I can come up with is that Graham’s advice didn’t take into account such low bond yields ever existing, and I’m probably better off following Dalio’s advice:

“ I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.”

I’ve gotten rid of bond ETFs completely from my portfolio, and now have some gold, emerging Asia markets, commodities, foreign value ETFs to replace them.

I’d love to hear all of your thoughts on both reconciling Graham’s investment approach with current bond yields and on Dalio’s thoughts. What do you think?",

mvwh0z,gveuvqj,investing,comment,1619067991,"Be very careful reading into what’s going.  In general people epic fail at complex systems.  No one predicted the large number of retail investors joining the market due to Covid nor gamblers switching to the stock market.  Most of what is getting publish is cherry picking data to prove their point.  Very few go out of the way to try to get a basic understanding and will recognize that all the data isn’t available publicly.  It is also a very complex system so trying to make short term predictions is hard because there are simply to many variables.  So you can say what is happening right now will not last forever due to simple mathematical properties but when will the market catch up to reality who knows.  When it goes it will not be for one reason, there will be multiple complex interactions just like 2008.

If bonds are a bad investment because interest rates are too low then why are the largest players buying them?  Means the have other uses besides getting the return.  What happens if bond yields go up any significant amount?  Well the world is in a debt bubble so when companies try to refinance they won’t be able too.  So they default and assets are sold to cover their debt.  Then you have to go a step further and ask what does that mean?  When this occurs money is destroyed and liquidity in the system is smaller since the thing lending the money didn’t get made whole.

Then you have another fact when interest rates go down the bond is worth more.  So even though most bonds are paying very little interest the note itself has been appreciating in value.  Since bonds can’t really go down much more they will stop appreciating in value.  For the last 40 years people have been told to move to bonds in retirement.  Most projections for pension funds and 401k is to earn 6 to 7%.  With an aging population there simply won’t be enough people to sustain even that.  Would need to grow the economy through actual production not asset speculation.

There isn’t going to be inflation in consumer goods long term because you have to have an increase in wages with relatively the same production.  The other thing you can get inflation is through supply shocks which are usually temporary.  The goods going up in price now are due to speculation(lumber) and supply shocks.  Most of the money being created goes to asset purchases which inflates asset price.  So far all debt driven bubbles for asset purchases have popped.  The more debt you put into the system the bigger the pop.

Jaguar Land Rover is to temporarily shut down production at two of its main UK factories because of a shortage of computer chips, in the latest sign of the difficulties facing the global car industry during the pandemic.

It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date.

The automotive industry is used to running lean “just-in-time” supply chains that minimise the amount of cash tied up in factory warehouses. However, the global nature of the chip shortage has strained carmakers as they compete directly with tech companies for supply.

Manufacturing will continue at JLR’s Solihull plant. JLR’s international factories in Slovakia, Brazil and China are as yet unaffected.",

mve8vh,,investing,post,1619006842,"Netflix Misses Q1 Subscriber Targets, Blaming Covid-19 Issues, But Beats Financial ForecastsNetflix reported 208 million global subscribers as of the end of the first quarter, missing its own prediction for 210 million.


The streaming giant did beat financial targets, though with earnings per share of $3.75 coming in well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.


The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

mvoso0,,investing,post,1619037311,"$KARO - Comprehensive DD - Recent IPO - Exec Summary**Exec Summary for those that want a TL:DR**

Firstly - I am an existing shareholder, own around 900 shares with an average buy price of $34 (so I am down on this... but in the current market, who isn't). KARO are a leading global provider of vehicle telematics. The proprietary in-house technology provides the best intelligent, actionable data to fleet operators and security for all vehicle owners - across 23 countries over 5 continents. Most interesting areas of the business to me are their AI Video & Fleet Telematics, along with how they use their data to sell used cars and insurance in the future. I am impressed that they seem to keep developing the business, whilst maintaining a very healthy 15% margin.

* KARO is a holding company, the actual company is Cartrack
* 1.3m subscribers with 50 billion data points each month - data provides KARO with a huge opportunity for growth
* Business has continued strong growth through Covid (16% compared to 22% CAGR previously), expected rate is 26% for future years
* Free cash flow around 25%
* Prior to delisting from JSE, to list on NASDAQ and then do an inwards investment back onto the JSE - the stock price hit $629, with a share consolidation taking place at 10:1 - giving at all time high of $62.90 per share. Typically South African investment is more conservative that US/EU investors - who are more accepting of potential earnings forming part of the share price.
* Price to earnings is 28x - which is low in their industry, with the average being around 53x

**Products & Services**

What does KARO currently offer?

B2B - known as 'My Fleet' - Live Vision to make sure the driver is concentrating and not on their phone, insurance telematics, fleet management and optimisation, stolen vehicle recovery and fleet administration services. All services typically outsourced, not many companies I know of will invest in developing this tech themselves which is good for Karo.

B2C - known as 'My Car' - Vehicle protector, stolen vehicle recover (with promise to customer), crash alert to emergency services and insurance telematics.

**Customer Profile**

**South Africa -** De Beers, MAN, Avis, SA Taxi, Super Sport, Hino and many more - company originates from SA and very strong YOY performance here.

**Rest of Africa** \- Toyota, Cat, Moove and NCBA

**Europe** \- LaFarge, Telefurgo, Green Galaxy and Sonae MC

**Asia** \- Singapore Prison Service, ORIX, Grab Rentals & Asia Brewery

Lots more to list - company has accounts open in the UK and US - with very small amounts of trade at the moment, but they have a track record of aggressive expansion whilst maintaining margins.

**Financials (Converted from ZAR to USD... took a while, so apologies if you spot any errors)**

Without doubt my favourite part of this company, extremely strong performer and growth looks very positive, with sufficient results to back up projections.

Low Debt - $1.2m

Total Cash - $7m

Free Cash Flow Margin - 25%

Total Assets - $140m

Total Liabilities - $56m

Debt Coverage - Well covered by operating cash flow (2019%)

Gross Margin - 71%

Revenue - $167m (c.4.5x market cap)

Earnings - $27.7m (roughly 15% margin & 28x market cap - industry average listed on Nasdaq is c.50x)

I will post a link to their IPO pack in the comments section - I have looked at the financials over and over, **I really struggle to see any negatives but if you find any, please can you leave a comment as I want to keep educating myself.**

**Bull Case - Top 4 Points**

Aggressive, rapid and consistent CAGR - in the 20% range. I absolutely love this, I know I'm down right now but my price target to exit this stock is around $45 as a low estimate. Even with the market performing badly, I am not worried about my investment here. It isn't speculative, they are delivering.

Big data - its been big for a long time, I'm convinced it will continue to be big in the future. They already generate 50 billion data points a month from their existing contracts. They are looking to get further integrated with the insurance market and second hand car sales. Knowing how people drive through their current offerings is going to be huge in selling products that instantly fit with the consumers goals. If they drive fast... maybe upsell the car and have an insurance package wrapped up to help seal the deal. If they are more conservative drivers but have a powerful car, sell something more appropriate. I think this is a major opportunity for the business.

The world is going to see more crime, insurance premiums are rising, people want more protection and Karo offer a service that fills this space. Yes, there is telematics competition but in the nicest possible way car theft in the regions they currently operate in is pretty high and in regions that they don't yet operate in. Factor this alongside how much crime will increase in a post covid world (due to poverty increasing), I think that their CAGR of 26% will be achieved. Rich get richer... poor get poorer etc, its sad but generally true. Those with money will want to protect their valued assets without risking their own personal wellbeing.

Businesses need what Karo are selling. Whether its AI controlled systems or human, fleet management want 99% plus optimisation, with Karo's growth and products on offer, they simply must be offering a high quality product. Live vision & fleet tracking is something I can see growing more and more. I know from personal experience of having to deal with a particularly painful Brexit, this would have been a life saver had all the fleet been managed in this way and could be traced at a click of a button. Integrated supply chains rely on this real time data, which to my disbelief doesn't currently exist throughout the world. Note - biggest single customer represents less than 2% revenue, so they are heavily diversified.

**Bear Case - Top 4 Points**

No major contracts in USA, Germany, France or UK. I don't know why, maybe it isn't in their strategy right now, but I'd really like to see them get a big contract in one of these regions. I'm sure it will come but it isn't there right now and although they may well do well in China - the markets I mention are strong and relatively stable compared to South Africa and current countries that they operate in.

Volume - its pretty low, the good news is... its a buyers market - the spreads aren't great, so would only enter with a limit order if you did decide to invest, be patient and I'd say no real need to click the ask button right now.

Competition - there is clear competition in the telematics industry, I'm not even going to try and counter this as its a basic fact. I have based my investment on the numbers I see in their investor pack, only you can decide whether these numbers are suitable for your investment and offer competitive value against other investment opportunities.

The number of risks listed in their SEC prospectus filing was pretty crazy - my positive spin on this is that they are aware of their risks, honest about them and have strategies to counter/mitigate against them. I'll post the link so you can check this out too, but please do before making a decision on whether to invest.

**Share Structure**

Relatively simple section - NASDAQ is the priority listing, total of c.21,000,000 shares - 20,000,000 held by insiders with a 180 day lock up. 9,000,000 listed on the JSE as in inwards listing.

Cartrack (KARO) used to be listed solely on the JSE - but due to expansion plans, has now listed on Nasdaq... it was listed the same day as UTME and genuinely believe a lot of investors missed this IPO due to the hype and price increase on UTME.

The company was previously valued at over $1 billion on the JSE and the CEO didn't sell any shares, as he went on record to say that he felt the company was worth at least $1.5 billion.

**Key Catalysts**

Earnings are due soon - I have spoken to their Investor Relations team and expected first week of May. I'm expecting that these are positive.

Covid risk lowering, more people returning to normal - cars left unattended in public places, more travel, more collisions, insurance going up and people using telematics to help reduce the total cost of car ownership.

The CEO has previously discussed how he believes cars will not be owned by individuals in the future and more fleet management will be required to make sure those in charge of a vehicle are driving responsibly. A lot depends on whether you share the same vision.

**AOB**

KRO was listed on the JSE today and traded up to $45 per share - the Nasdaq listing trading currently around $32 at the time of writing this.

I would be interested to read your comments and feedback.

mutq93,,investing,post,1618934752,"Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's handNew York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

But institutional investors are, for the most part, not bearish. A few of the early ones in have gotten burned, and a lot of the rest believe this market is ready for a sustained up trend and are just waiting to the pull the trigger until they can get confirmation.

n2wv08,,StockMarket,post,1619921287,"Waste Management (NYSE: $WM) DD I wrote for a discord I'm inWhen searching for a company to do a DD on this week for this Discord, I initially was struggling to land on a company. There are just so many dividend growth companies on my watchlist that I didn’t know where to start. Initially I was wanting to do a write up on HanesBrands, ticker $HBI, due to everyone needing underwear and socks but then I realized I hadn’t put on underwear since I got home from work on Friday, so I just couldn’t bring myself to break that streak to product test this company as thoroughly as I would have liked. However, this did lead me to throwing away some older underwear from the back of my drawer and having to race out to get them in the bin before the truck picked up this morning. Funnily enough, it was this little act that led me down the rabbit hole of America's first, largest, and objectively best waste management company, $WM. This write up will attempt to go over some of the reasons I view $WM as a prime choice for any dividend growth investor who is seeking to add to their industrial holdings by buying a company worth holding for 20+ years, including some basic financial information, how WM can grow into the future, as well as some potential problems with the stock that I see. Finally I am not a financial advisor and this is written purely for the purpose of sharing some publicly available stock info in the form of a poorly written, weed induced WM DD, I hope you enjoy.

The aptly named Waste Management, ticker symbol $WM, is an industrial sector powerhouse with first mover-advantage specializing in the waste management sub-sector that has been slowly and steadily raising its dividend over the last 18 years. Waste Management operates primarily with four different revenue streams consisting of waste collection, landfill operations, waste transportation, and finally, recycling. It is with these four primary sources of revenue that allow $WM to boast a current dividend yield of 1.68% with a yearly dividend of $2.30 paid out quarterly in March, June, September, and December. This dividend represents a payout ratio of only 53% which is not very high at all and is actually very sustainable. In fact, it has a dividend safety score of 98 from simplysafedividends.com and is over where management is aiming for their dividend to be (between 40-50% according to their 2020 Investors day presentation.) In addition to being very sustainable, a payout ratio of 53% also leaves room for growth, and $WM has been doing just that. While it's 4 year average dividend yield is just slightly higher at 1.98% compared to todays at 1.68% the amount that yield represents has been growing at an average rate of 41.46% over the last 5 years, 28.24% over the last 3 years, and even in the shitstorm that was 2020, WM raised its dividend by 6.34% just showing that this company not only cares about it's dividend growth, but that it can easily afford to raise its dividend as one important thing to note is that during the last 18 years (since 2004) of consistent dividend increases, the payout ratio has more or less remained unchanged, maintaining managements preferred 40-50% payout ratio  with occasional outbreaks such as where we are currently due to a contagious outbreak that rocked the entire world. Finally, Waste Management has a Current Price of ≅ $138, an analyst price range of $125-$160, and an average analyst price target of $144 showing some room for this stock to still raise or fall to a better entry point if it does fall to test the lower analysts prediction. 

Moving on from the dividend and surface level stock price breakdowns, $WM has a current P/E ratio of 37.7 and I know this might seem very high, it actually isn't when you compare it to other waste management companies. For instance, WM’s next three largest competitors are Republic Services, with a P/E of 35.2, Clean Harbor, with a P/E of 36.7, and Waste Connections, which has a huge P/E of 141.13 (this is the only one of the three that I went and checked multiple sites and yes, it really is that big...) As you can see, a P/E ratio in the low to mid 30’s basically comes with the territory of being in the waste management sub-sector. Just as the P/E ratio comes with the sub-sector; growth in the form of acquisitions will almost always bring some additional debt as its +1, and this is the next aspect of $WM’s balance sheet that I want to touch on. In 2019 Waste Management achieved a major milestone for any company, it officially made enough to fully pay down it's yearly short term debt and pay off future long term debt, an achievement it had not completed since at least 2016 (and possibly before but this is the furthest back I could find regarding short term debt payments). Regardless, this is still an important feat as it shows that $WM is making enough money to support not only a growing dividend, but also additional amounts of debt to fund new acquisitions now and in the future. Now how can I make the claim that they can afford to take even more debt on? Well in 2020 (yeah the shitiest of shity years for businesses) $WM paid off all their short term debt and an additional $7.8 Billion in long term debt as well, just showing the strength of it's balance sheet and how the acquisitions it's made are paying off in time.

Finally the last bit of financial digging I did resulted in me coming across something that did cause me to pause and I feel that any decent DD should include some potential negatives to put the positives into a better, more complete light. The elephant in the room in regards to Waste Management is it's unusually high P/B ratio of 7.7ish. While this ratio is generally not as important in the industrial waste management compared to say the financial sector, it is still important to compare it to its peers. The same three competitors mentioned above all have lower P/B ratios than $WM. Ultimately this just means it is slightly overpriced compared to its book value, this can be explained away simply by the fact that in 2019, seeing that it could pay off all it's short term debt, Waste Management added a large amount of debt to its balance sheet so that it could buy new acquisitions, one such acquisition was Advanced Disposal for 4.6 Billion. This higher P/B ratio also explains Morningstars 2 star rating. However my response to this information is just this: If you plan to buy and hold a stock for 20 years, isn’t it better to open your position early, accrue dividends and price appreciation, while buying dips, than to just wait for its P/B ratio to dip down to a level you’re more comfortable with? Especially considering that there is a very good chance that as the debt goes down as the acquisitions begin paying for themselves, so too will the P/B ratio fall.

Moving on from financials and more towards hard assets, Waste Managements true strength starts to take form as it truly lives up to what one imagines from a company with first-mover advantage in its respective sub-sector. The company services over 20 million residential and 2 million commercial customers in 48 US States, Canada, DC, and Puerto Rico. $WM has a total of 293 active landfills with an average remaining lifespan of 22 years per landfill. They also have 346 waste transfer/consolidation stations, 146 recycling centers making it the largest recycling network in the nation , 16 waste to energy facilities that burn up to 23,000 pounds of trash to generate up to 670 MW/hour of electrical/steam energy, enough to power 660,000 homes. Waste Management also boasts 4 new Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities that have already created more than 16 million gallons of RNG since coming online. This is enough RNG to power 1/3 of their 26,000 strong fleet and sell the remaining to local energy companies that then use the RNG to power roughly 460,000 homes. Finally every other landfill that WM owns and operates that isn't a special waste-to-energy or RNG facility also has some more basic ways to capture the methane that comes naturally with decomposing trash and sells that to local gas-to-energy companies that use the supplied methane to help power an additional 180,000 homes per year, bringing the total number of homes powered by trash to a whopping 1.3 million and WM only plans to raise that number to over 2 million in the coming years.

The last aspect of Waste Management that I want to discuss is their future growth prospects and why I am bullish on them as a company overall despite the higher than average P/B ratio the company currently has. Everyone creates waste and we all need that waste taken away somewhere so that we can live the normal lives we have become accustomed to. In addition to being the largest, the first, and objectively the best waste management company, $WM is also investing heavily into renewable energy by harnessing the naturally occurring methane and other RNG’s that are simply by-products of their primary business.  In addition to selling the naturally produced energy that they found themselves having on their hands, $WM has also found a way to make money off of full and capped landfills by taking advantage of existing power lines that run to and from local electrical infrastructure turning them into solar farms and boosting the local power supply. Waste Management is also currently undergoing a change in it's payment model, a shift away from a flat rate bundled model that didn’t take into account the costs of processing and holding the waste $WM picks up, and is changing to a fee-for-service model which will take into account everything from pick-up to transport, to recycling to even the costs it takes to turn that waste into energy. This move will essentially turn every action $WM takes into a way to make money. By providing such an essential service that no-one is exempt from needing, $WM has positioned itself amazingly to continue being the industry leader in waste management for decades to come. And that is no understatement, Waste Management has proven to be a very sticky company with a customer typically being a customer for 10+ years. The final aspect of $WM’s growth potential I want to dig up hits closer to home for me and those in Texas than others, and that is Waste Management basically has a monopoly in Texas. Yes there are competitors here, but between being headquartered in Houston which is the 4th largest city in the nation and rapidly growing, and having cornered the market in the new silicon valley cities of San Antonio and Austin, $WM can rest easily knowing they have future customers for years to come.

Overall I am extremely bullish on Waste Management and see this as an investment to hold for the 25 to 30 years I have left until retirement and honestly, with $WM I might get to retirement early, and while investing in trash might not be a dirty job, as someone who grew up watch Mike Rowe, I think it's only fitting that I make my portfolio get a little dirty to make money.","['RSG', 'WM', 'HBI']"

n2ulyl,,StockMarket,post,1619913045,"Target prices for OXY? - OXY trending down, confusing why with oil prices staying above $60 a barrel. Seems like OXY is significantly undervalued. Curious on people's thoughts.The obvious downside to OXY is potential weakness that resurfaces again in the oil market and it's debt load. Although, as long as the oil market stays reasonable price it's debt load seems highly manageable. Also, if the oil market stays reasonably priced for the next year or so I think it's highly likely OXY redeclares dividends which should boost it's stock price. 

&#x200B;

Specifically, for their last quarter, 4Q2020, and pursuant to their earning call slides, they had cash flow from operations, before working capital expenditures, of $1.4 billion.

&#x200B;

Those same slide indicated an approximately $215 million annual cash flow, or $53.75 million quarterly cash flow increase per $1 increase of oil prices.

&#x200B;

Pursuant to OXY's 10-k, the average realized oil price for 2020 was $39.

&#x200B;

The average oil price for this year has varied between $47.62 and  $67.98. With essentially all of this year being above $50. Thus, a conservative approximation of average realized oil price is probably at least $53 barrel. 

&#x200B;

That's a difference of at least $14 per barrel translating to a quarterly cash flow increase of $752.5 million and, adding that to 4Q2020, cash flow, giving a quarterly cash flow of $2.152 billion. 

&#x200B;

In the same 4Q2020 earning slides, there is a projected 2021 cap ex expenditures of $2.9 billion, or $725 million. per quarter. Thus, giving $1.4 billion in free cash flow generation. 

&#x200B;

Pursuant to OXY's 4Q2020 10-k, OXY's biggest yearly debt burden is in the next 6 years through 2026, with several $1 billion debt maturing and a $3 billion debt maturing. The total debt maturing in the next 6 years is $13.565 billion, which averages out to $2.260 billion per year, or $560 million per quarter.

&#x200B;

Thus, with oil at or above $53 barrel and generating $1.4 billion in free cash flow generation, it should be more than enough to plan for and pay off OXY's significant debt payments coming in the next 6 years. Allocating the amount as calculated above, it would leave about $840 million per quarter in free cash flow after debt payments. 

&#x200B;

That should be more than sufficient to bring back substantial dividends, maybe not at the same level as before but could easily be in the $0.50 to $0.7 per quarter range, and, thus, over $2 per year. 

&#x200B;

With dividends of $2 per year, and assuming an approximately 6% yield, it would give the stock price a value of $33.33. 

&#x200B;

Altogether, it seems as long as WTI oil is at or above $50 a barrel OXY's ability to handle it's debt is pretty safe and it begins to turn back into a cash flow giant. All of these numbers above feel fairly conservative, at least to me, since this quarter oil is likely to average closer to the $60 mark then the $50 mark which simply makes the case for OXY more compelling. Also, the world is beginning to come back to normal so there's a good chance oil demand increase even further driving oil prices higher. 

&#x200B;

The if here, which is admittedly a big if, is the stability of oil prices and the oil market. Overall though, it does seem like OXY is undervalued and, if you have faith in the oil market, OXY is significantly undervalued. 

&#x200B;

Curious of people's thoughts on this. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: With oil market stabilizing/stabilized, it seems like OXY can safely handle it's debt and is likely a cash flow giant. Seems underpriced to me, a little confused why OXY hasn't trended up more with WTI oil recently trending up back above $60 per barrely. barely",['OXY']

n1ttf5,,StockMarket,post,1619789216,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/qg04a2wabbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0486800be95f3c49097df601935236a2bc500b11

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

https://preview.redd.it/xq68n5kbbbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=327a831304a22ffb7588037b74da15e2de559e9b

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

Watched some interviews with successful day traders, who are students of tim skyes, and they mentioned how it is different trading OTC vs listed, that they just stick to OTC.

So some of the reasons they mentioned were that OTC charts tend to be more cleaner (which i guess to be respecting support and resistance lines more; forming better setups that offer an easy stop), less prone to manipulation and algo trading (thus less noise and cleaner ?).

Personally for me I’ve been trying to learn trading with listed big cap high volume stocks (with high volume options) because i’m using a small account (at least starting small), hence i wanna keep spreads as small as possible.

n2uymj,,StockMarket,post,1619914293,"Biden's new tax proposal worries investorsFinancial advisers and analysts say they have already received a flurry of phone calls and emails from clients asking about President Biden’s proposed tax plan, which would tax those making more than $1 million a year at a rate of 39.6% on profits on assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and businesses. That is nearly double the current rate of 20%.

Many want to know what changes, if any, they should make to their investments. And others are worried about how markets will fare under a higher-tax rate environment.

“Conversations about taxes have picked up over the last two weeks,” said Marc Scudillo, managing officer of EisnerAmper Wealth Management & Corporate Benefits LLC. “This is coming much faster than people anticipated,” Mr. Scudillo added, referring to some investors’ belief that Mr. Biden wouldn’t attempt a tax overhaul until 2022.

A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data.

While the proposal requires approval by Congress, where it will be subject to negotiations and possible changes, here is what experts say investors should take away from the plan:

**Not all investments would be subject to the new tax rate.**

Most investors hold a variety of assets, ranging from taxable brokerage accounts to IRAs and employer-sponsored savings plans like 401(k)s. Only some of these accounts are taxable.

In fact, in a Tax Policy Center study, analysts estimated just a quarter of U.S. corporate stocks are held in taxable accounts, down from more than four-fifths in 1965. Much of the rest appears to be held in accounts that are exempt from taxes, including retirement accounts, pension funds and, in many cases, assets owned by foreign investors.

The actual number of taxpayers who would be affected by the rate increase will also be relatively limited. The White House estimates just 0.3% of taxpayers fall into the income bracket that would be hit by the boost.",

Adjusted to fix big ticker mistake on my part - Paramount Pictures is owned by Viacom (thanks heroes for the facts). **Do not confuse this with the real estate group.**

*Thank you for patience, I am just an idiot trying to share with my bro's to the best of my ability!*

Hasbro & Paramount Pictures (OWNED BY VIACOM) are aligned for a new golden era of toys and imaginative entertainment in a way we haven't seen since the mid 90's. I'm excited as $#%! about these toys, and the FUN entertainment coming soon.

Part 1

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**$HAS (Hasbro)**  

Hasbro toys are at peak engineering after years of investment, with careful ""wave"" rollouts to reduce overproduction to market demand, and are breaking out of the ""Collector"" zone that has plagued toys for 30 years.

Through their partnership with Disney (see Star Wars Black series of toys) and Marvel (see Legends series of toys), Hasbro has carefully and diligently engineered innovative new action figure features.

&#x200B;

[ Innovative designs create realistic postures without sacrificing durability ](https://preview.redd.it/vphcu9luqfw61.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9b2ba9ae2bbede755e8c24fc5c203ea83581d0)

**Supply & Demand**


COVID was a major threat to most industries. Hasbro, however, may have benefited.

Let me explain.

Hasbro had GI Joe Classified figures supply totally dried up. They didn't expect the major resurgence of interest in the line, and had largely ramped up to sell to Collectors, like they have for 30 years now. This spike in demand, paired with scalpers (who are earning video game console release-level Scalping money on these toys), have made it virtually impossible for the regular customers to buy them.

* Target exclusives - sold out on day 1. Restock still pending for 6+ months
* Hasbro direct - sold out
* Ebay - Holy moly... $$$$
* Hasbro's inability to rapidly produce at the start of COVID actually... helped. They got tons of market feedback, resulting in a re-paint on previously release character. People wanted a less cartoonish appearance, and more realistic color choices. **This is a very Agile approach, and the results are incredible.**
* Efficiency with the line - Instead of small and giant Joes, they have **one Medium size 6""** that is standard with EVERY OTHER LINE - Disney, Marvel, and more. The toybox just got a standard unit of measure. **Even the freaking heads and hands are interchangeable!**
* **Small lineups in each wave** \- 2 to 6 figures in each push, careful planning, and using similar elements for future characters to reduce manufacturing turnarounds. Profits, baby!
* They were able to align toy plans with the delayed Snake Eyes film. See the [action figures slated for October release](https://www.entertainmentearth.com/product/gi-joe-classified-series-6inch-action-figures-wave-6-case-of-6/hse8346f).

**But the best part that tells me they are about to make great strides is the response to scalpers, and news about major productions to meet demand coming soon.**

“[If any of you are scalpers in here, get your high price now](https://toy-wizards.com/2020/12/04/g-i-joe-classified-repaints-and-more-on-the-way-for-2021/)”.

Hasbro restocks just started to hit Walmart and other online sellers in the last couple of weeks, finally filling orders that have been queued up for some time.

Folks - we have not even hit the summer movies that are going to redefine GI Joe for the next generation. This demand hasn't even started to hit peak.

Which leads me to Part 2...

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

**$VIAC (Paramount pictures is owned by Viacom, NOT the other ticker which is a real estate group)** 
 
Ok - Hasbro doesn't operate in a silo. It thrives based on engaging with young people (and old Toys R Us kids who never grew up like me) based on intellectual properties from all forms of entertainment companies.

The first attempt at GI Joe was about as well received as the Hulk movies. Swing and a miss. But the cat was also out of the bag in both of those cinematic universes, and it hurt a bit.

Then came Iron Man. Iron man did not disown the previous, but it did choose to pave a new path forward. It was an incredible (pun intended) business decision, and we all saw how they defined the market for the last decade+.

Enter Paramount with Snake Eyes origins move, coming this July. This is the ""Iron Man"" of the Hasbro toy lines. GI Joe is about to level up, and we are going to see a huge wave of nostalgia as well as next gen kids who finally have the toy lines to match a modern play experience.

Amazon has Lady Jaye show lined up for Paramount as well. Its coming folks. Its getting real.

**GI Joe/Transformers crossover movie?** Still on the table for pre-production. And Transformers is due for a reboot too (Yes, time flies, but it has been a LOOONG time already).

**The Rock?** In for life still.

And with EACH OF THESE, a careful, lean, well engineered line of toys compatible with the rest in your toybox.

**Paramount is about to get a LOT of attention for their IP in the next decade.**

**Current prices & Valuations**

* **Are these shorted stocks like we have seen in big plays on WSB?**  

   * **No.** I do not believe these are the type of stock where we are sticking it to the hedge funds in any way. To be clear, I am a believer in QUALITY toys, and I just really really love what they are building together.
   * Viacom does have some short interest, [but it has reduced by \~40% in a month](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/)
* **Ok, so if they aren't shorted, are they undervalued today?**  

   * Do some DD yourselves, and I would love to hear opinions, but I believe they are fairly priced now, and have a clear history of growth with the business as it stands today.
   * **HOWEVER! I strongly believe they are FAR underpriced compared to what will happen in July this year, through end of the year.**
   * I am also LONG on them beyond the growth I anticipate this year. 2023-2025 will yield even more movie properties relaunching that are going to EXPLODE demand for these goods, and create engagement for the far future entertainment offerings from Paramount.
* **Everything on the market is overvalued... isn't it?**  

   * Maybe. However, I suspect Hasbro is a bit low key to date. **I don't believe they have been impacted by strong speculation that other stocks have seen in the market today.**
   * Viacom had a huge run up. However, I think the price is more than fairly valued at about what it was pre-Covid decline. **This means adding IP to streaming and theaters on balanced budget productions can yield BIG returns and even BIGGER engagement from audiences.**

* **Company Financials**  

   * You should look for yourself, but [Hasbro is an extremely profitable company already](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/HAS:NASDAQ?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiq36yD4KbwAhUMHDQIHcE_ANYQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw). More tendies coming.
   * $HAS with a market cap of $13.61B, 137,559,000 shares outstanding makes it very appealing to me as a fairly priced opportunity for what it is today. I think this leaves tons of room for pushing new heights.
   * Cash on hand of 1.3 BILLION dollars means low chances of share dilution going forward and more than enough capital to support rapid scaling production.
   * **Paramount Pictures (VIAC)** \- **They're building the partnerships with Amazon and others needed to make this a serious opportunity for these major intellectual properties and a cinematic universe.**  

      * There are probably better VIAC DD out there than I can possibly do as an illiterate. This is closer to a major catalyst than a proper VIAC DD. But it has CRITICAL synergy to Hasbro's future.
      * An example of more recent DD is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0r0n8/goldman_sachs_viacomcbs_inc_viac_buy_the_most/) from [u/DrApeKing](https://www.reddit.com/u/DrApeKing/) (I don't know, he has a good name)
* **Positions or ban**  

   * I don't have much to spend. I am in HAS for 10 shares at $98.75
   * I plan to buy Viacom next week as it is at a really great price IMHO after tanking from previous March pumps. $1000 bucks it what I consider a lot to put in, and that's my intent.
   * I also now own some of the Real Estate group stock because I am illiterate (name checks out)
   * I don't do Calls or Puts because I can't afford to lose everything. You do you!
   * Yes, I plan to buy more constantly, as I can afford to add more to my positions.

**\~\~TL;DR\~\~**

**More reasons for Viacom! Also, Excuses for toys!**

**Adults and kids want these action figures with more demand than we have seen since the mid 90's. Snake Eyes movie and GI JOE Amazon shows are going to explode toy demand, and Paramount Pictures (Viacom) is finally lined up to launch a true blockbuster entertainment franchise to turn into a major profitable entertainment company.**

**The last decade of toys were iterative engineering efforts, and the payout starts THIS YEAR on those investments.**

**Both companies are set to play well to each other's strengths, and surge demand for their toys and entertainment together.**

Every other lender that’s had ER has beat and RKT is North America’s largest mortgage originator. They have been heavily undervalued and manipulated for months. CEO stated the stock was still undervalued when it ran to $43 a few weeks ago. It’s an absolute steal in the $22s. And it’s not just a mortgage company. They are 14 different companies all under the same ticker. Rocket Auto will formally launch soon and I expect they will rapidly increase market share there just as they have in mortgages. There is virtually zero bearish case against them. If/when rates rise they won’t be effected due to their multiple platforms and the rapid pace at which they eat up market share. The ONLY reason the price is so low right now is because daily volume has been obsolete. Look at the charts. With volume (which will come in HEAVY next week) this thing gamma squeezes based on the huge call OI. Get in now and double your $$$ in a short time.

The market fell on Friday after a record-setting session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) pulling back after recording fresh intraday highs. Market participants continue to assess the slew of corporate earnings reports and recent, encouraging economic data. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Shares of Amazon (AMZN) outperformed the market, jumping to a new record high after reporting blowout Q1 earnings fueled by sustained demand, showing great strength even as the economy in the US begins to reopen. Shares of Twitter, on the other hand, sunk after the company fell short of estimates, disappointing investors who hoped the company would show a strong pick-up in ad sales like peers Snap (SNAP) and Facebook (FB).

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. 
* Personal income jumped 21.1% in March over February, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. This came in better than the 20.3% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Shares of Nio outperformed the broader market, trading roughly 2% higher after the company reported better-than-expected earnings.

From my experience trading stocks over the years, I have learned that when my stop-loss orders start getting triggered left to right, the market is getting ready to change phases. Multiple stop-losses activated today, telling me that we are perhaps moving from a ""stage two"" uptrend into a ""stage three"" sideways trend( weekly timeframe)?

&#x200B;

As you can see in the picture below, both the $SPY and $QQQ are moving in ""stage three"" sideways motion (Daily timeframe). I wouldn't be surprised if this soon turns into a ""stage four"" downward trend (Daily timeframe) from the market's activity.

&#x200B;

As usual, we cannot predict the market, but we can analyze it and prepare for what may come. Bringing my stop-loss orders closer to keep more of my profits when things get rough and staying out of the market during corrections has enabled me to achieve super performance.

this drug is immune to mutations of COVID-19, simply because it does not target COVID-19. This “in the weeds” company is called Humanigen and their therapeutic drug is called Lenzilumab.
 
Lenzilumab, with other treatments including steroids and/or remdesivir, help prevent and treat an immune hyper-response, (cytokine storm).

Fully administered in one day, Lenzilumab improves patient SpO2 levels within the first 24 hours as shown by mayo clinic study and can prevent progression to invasive mandatory ventilation by 54%. It helps get patients out of the ICU/ hospital sooner, making more room for other critical patients in need.

One item that may be a concern is the cost of the drug. However, the need for mechanical ventilation significantly increases the costs of COVID-19 care, as well as having a prolonged stay in the ICU. I’m not sure on Canada’s numbers in our healthcare, but in the States, it’s 5x the cost Mechanical Ventilation Adds 5X the Cost to COVID-19 Care | Premier (premierinc.com)[5x cost ](https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/blog/mechanical-ventilation-adds-5x-the-cost-to-covid-19-care)

Of the currently available vaccines with mutations on the rise and reduced efficacy against them, I believe that Lenzilumab can help save lives and solve multiple problems that we are currently facing. Such as, reduce need for invasive mandatory ventilation, immune to mutant strains, reduce hospital stay ie. More bed availability, fast reoxygenation response, fully administered in 1 day, cost savings on healthcare, etc. I want to put eyes on this because it seems that it’s getting silenced from HF shorts.

n1z2fv,,StockMarket,post,1619804301,"$MDLZ - A Sweet Buy for the Long Run**Company Overview** 

Mondelez International Inc. is a consumer business that manufactures and sells snacks and beverages worldwide. It is known as the market leader in biscuits, chocolates, and gums and candies, and owns multiple million-dollar brands such as Cadbury and Milka chocolates, Belvita, Oreo, Trident, Toblerone, and Halls. It sells its products through supermarkets, wholesalers, convenience stores, and other distributors. Mondeleze operates in 80 countries and sells its products in over 150 countries. With a market cap of 84.34 B, they have consistently demonstrated strong financial performance, with revenue and net income of $26.6B and $3.6B USD in 2020. 

**Industry Overview**

Mondelez operates in the snack foods industry, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% to $688.6 B by 2027. This is driven by a rise in disposable incomes, improving consumer lifestyle, and growing urbanization that increase demand for convenience foods. Key trends include an increased demand for salty and health-conscious snacks, which positions Mondelez well as it generates 43% of revenue from biscuits and has acquired multiple health brands. The largest segment is Europe, while the fastest growing market is China, which provides an advantage for Mondelez, which generates 40% of revenue from Europe and 20% from the Asia Pacific region. 

The mature snack industry is highly fragmented and is dominated by large corporations as well as small local brands. Pepsico is the industry leader, holding 7.1% of market share, while Mondelez (6.9%), Nestle (3.6%), and Kellogg (1.8%) follow. Barriers to entry are low, with many private labels entering with innovative products that could pose a threat to Mondelez’ market share. Customers care deeply about flavours and branding, as 68% of customers rely on existing brands rather than new ones, giving Mondelez a competitive advantage.

**Investment Thesis** 

**Thesis 1: Powerful and Innovative Brands Driving Revenue Growth.** Mondelez has a strong economic moat through its brand power, as it owns over 9 brands over $1 billion and numerous “local jewels” that drive organic revenue growth. Its biscuit brands Oreo and Belvita are ranked as the #1 biscuit globally, and their chocolate brands of Cadbury, Milka, and Toblerone are ranked #1 in Europe and AMEA countries. Meanwhile, they hold numerous local jewels such as Lacta, Alpen Gold, and Marabou which rank as the #1 brands in Brazil, Russia, and Sweden respectively. These brands, which make up 75% of its revenue, garner significant brand loyalty, generating operating margins that are \~2% higher than competitors and 2.6% organic revenue growth in 2020. 

Moreover, Mondelez frequently engages in brand innovation, adapting brands to local trends and creating healthy alternatives to adapt to changing consumer preferences through its innovation hub, SnackFutures. Examples include launching Oreo Forbidden City in China in 2018 and amplifying Cadbury Bournvita nutrition credentials in India in 2020, leading to double-digit sales growth in both areas. Mondolez intends to continue its marketing and innovation spend from 2020-2025, positioning it well for the future. 

**Thesis 2: Aggressive Acquisition Strategy Creating Strong Runway for Growth.** Mondelez’s aggressive acquisition strategy of brands in developed and emerging markets creates a strong runway for growth. This strategy is effective for two reasons: it allows them to bolster their product portfolio in high-potential segments and expand geographically, which will drive future revenue. From 2018 to 2020, they have acquired over 6 brands across a variety of food segments with a focus on premium and health foods. Most recently, they acquired Give and Go, a leader in bakery goods, and capitalized on the consumer trend of healthy eating through buying Hu Snack Foods, a leading health food company. These stakes are expected to generate an additional $550M in revenue. Moreover, this acquisition strategy allows them to expand their geographical footprint across nations, with its stake in JDE Peet, the world’s largest tea group, increasing their European and global revenues. 

**Thesis 3: Strong Management Team with History of Shareholder Value Generation.** Mondelez has a strong management team who place emphasis on generating shareholder value. Their compensation system links pay to long-term profitability and incorporates executive stock ownership, incentivizing management to focus on creating shareholder value. Over the past 3 years, their cumulative Total Shareholder Return has been 45.9%, compared to a peer median group’s of 18.7%. ROIC and ROE have increased 3% and 6% respectively since 2017, and they have had dividend payouts increasing by 24% per year from $0.82 in 2018 to $1.20 in 2020. They have also consistently generated strong cash flow of \~$2700 since 2017. Management has reaffirmed its 2021 goals to generate organic revenue of +3%, Free Cash Flow of +3B, and to have dividend growth outpace EPS growth, meaning that investors can expect to see significant upside in the future. 

**Catalysts & Risks** 

**(C1) Acquisitions in Health Companies:** Mondelez’s recent acquisition of Grenade, a Britain protein bar company, will drive European revenue and allow it to capitalize on demand for healthy snacking options. 

**(C2) Focus on Sustainability:** Mondelez’s sustainability initiatives, such as its recent announcement to launch Sustainable Futures, an impact investing platform to support sustainable ventures, will boost brand sentiment. 

**(C3) Potential to Surpass First Quarter Earnings:** Mondelez has performed strongly in Q1 2021 due to strong demand from their international markets. With the recovery of the global economy driving consumer spending, there is a high chance of beating earnings expectations in Q2, which will drive up stock price. 

**(R1) Foreign Exchange:** As 75% of Mondelez’s revenues come from outside the US, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will negatively impact earnings. In 2020, FX lowered revenue by 3%.

**(R2) Regulatory Risks:** Being a global company, Mondelez is subject to regulatory risks such as the imposition of new tariffs, sanctions, trade barriers, or restrictions on key commodities such as cocoa. 

**(R3) Impact of COVID-19 on Emerging Markets:** The COVID-19 outbreak could result in lower profits in emerging markets due to disruption of manufacturing and retail operations if social distancing rules are enacted.

**Valuation**

Through conducting a discounted cash flow analysis, I recommend longing MDLZ. At its current share price (April 29, closing) of $60.91, I believe it is undervalued by 12.5% compared to its fair value of $68.50.

A Letter to the Employees of Neovasc, Inc.

I am writing to appeal to the good hard working professionals at Neovasc. Today more than ever, professionals are seeking and demanding, businesses that practice Social Responsibility. The days are gone of businesses not being held accountable for their actions…and just as impactful…their inactions. Companies are now, rightfully so, expected to conduct themselves in an Ethical, legal and economic responsible manner. Equal pay, diversity and inclusion, and stewardship of the environment are no longer perks, but the minimum standard.

Shouldn’t a business, treat its investors and shareholders with that very same level of respect and responsibility?

For the past several years, the executive management and Board of Directors of Neovasc have destroyed the livelihoods of its investors. Due to management’s greed and corruption, investors have found their investments turn to ashes. Is there no social responsibility accorded to shareholders? 

Is holding life saving products hostage in order to continue to scam investors out of their hard earn money and life savings, socially responsible? 

Furthermore, is it socially responsible, to NOT communicate the perpetual dire state of Neovasc’s existence to its employees, who may or may not have a job on any given day?

Neovasc’s business model consists of making wild speculation and calling them projections and forecasts. Operations funded via toxic financing and passing on all the risk to unsuspecting investors in the stock market. This is neither an ethical, nor arguably, a legal manner to conduct a business.

A professional should work for a company that is a badge of honor on their resume…not a stain of disgrace.

This kind of comment really worries me because it sounds like you didn't read the one liner on what the product you bought actually does. What they do is give you a multiple of the underlying's **daily** performance, and if you tally the numbers I can guarantee you that's what they did, to a T. Then you paid high fees and whatever commission they pass through to you for their derivatives trading, which also means they don't pay much of a dividend (if at all).

I know you pay taxes on your profit from selling, but what if I'm long term holding? If I sell and then put that money back into long term stocks, I still need to pay taxes on that profit correct? Is there a simple way of keeping track of it all? My overall investment account is still under 10k, so it would be a large amount, I just don't want the IRS coming after me because I didn't understand. Any help would be appreciated, and sorry for sounding like such a noob. Thanks!!",

n1im7n,,StockMarket,post,1619743598,"Learnings from 10 yrs. Wall St. Experience - Understanding Shareholder BehaviorHey all!! There's interest so I'm moving to share the knowledge and tactics I've learned 10 years of Wall St. starting with a simple step-by-step book!

My plan is to share as much as possible. Here's a fun one to start.

**Shareholder ownership as a tool. TLDR:** Shareholder lists help you anticipate how stock moves, the quality of the business, and ideas potential ""catalysts."" And be valuation flexible!

If you are interested, I'd love to hear your [feedback here](https://forms.gle/RyycWAxNRsGZSxwTA) (2 minutes!). Here is the [outline of the book.](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) (or leave a comment!). Or get in on the [pre-sale!](https://gum.co/czkJr)

There are three major institutional groups in the markets.

**1 - Passive funds.** ETFs and funds that invest based on indexes (like $SPY). They are over 50% over equity assets and likely account for most buying / selling volume day to day. They buy with inflows (people buying the fund) and buy more when stocks goes higher (market-cap weighted).

So how do you use this insight?

One is pick stocks in macro / sector flow ($XLE, $XLF, $XLRE, $XLC - top returns YTD - oil prices, rates, real estate, retail - all higher), and style flows ($IJR and $IWD - top returns YTD - small-caps, value).

The more % shares are ETF (i.e. passive), the more the stock will move with the factor / sector.

Second and very importantly, ***you must be flexible on valuation.*** When company's growth improves, the value of the company increases, so passive funds will ***buy more*** of the stock.

This is exactly what happened with $TSLA. ETFs will buy MORE as it gets bigger.

Use valuation to understand the business and its upside but know that valuation is NOT a reason (alone) to buy or sell something - the majority of funds don't even look at it.

**2 - Hedge funds (HF)** These funds that invest with specialized strategies (provide ""alpha""). Well-respected names like Lone Pine / WhaleRock for growth, or value HFs like Scion (Burry), Miller, Nuance.

When you see a HF they are stock for a reason. There could be a catalyst (""event"") or strategic business change, or some emerging ""secular"" trend.

Use them source of interesting ideas. And check 13Fs for new positions.

For example, Lone Pine is playing the new growth of $SNAP and continuous glucose monitors $DXCM. Whale Rock is is in auto travel ($UBER, $CVNA). Pura Vida is in $INOV for its strategic pivot.

Now the downside is HF activity can make the stock more *volatile.* A stock like $MSCI bounced around a lot last year as HFs came in and out.

The long/short (LS) funds Citadel, Point72 and Millennium don't show up on 13Fs - but they are also very active since they crowd in and out of names with leverage (i.e borrowed money). When volatility picks up like in February / March these funds all ""de-gross"" or reduce exposure and that can be an opportunity to pick up shares sold-off hard.

**3 - Long only investors (LO)** \- These are the mutual funds that manage retail retirement assets. Companies also love them as shareholders because they usually hold for many years.

Respected names are Capital, Fidelity, TRowe, JP Morgan, American.

How is this useful?

Use them to help assess the business. These funds are in high-quality companies (like $SPGI) where there is less risk of blowups like fraud. Fidelity and TRowe have management teams rotating in and out to see them -where they are grilled by specialized sector research teams. They do their diligence.

The stock will likely be less volatile since LO's don't trade and may buy dips to accumulate shares.

Names like Baron, Ballie Gifford, Jennison are very respected at identifying growth / innovative companies. Use them as a vote of confidence in a new company. For example, Baron and Ballie were both early to invest in $TLSA and Jennison in $ADYEN, and have both done very well.

**Happy investing!!**

(You can see this information in Atom Finance ownership lists. And WhaleWisdom for 13Fs.)

&#x200B;

The last two highpoint have a .01 difference in their opening values, but around .75 cent difference in the daily high... I was wondering what value I should use when drawing the pattern.  Either way I'm also wondering if that small of a difference would constitute a wedge as opposed to an ascending triangle... thanks!",
n1x4tu,gwfuwon,StockMarket,comment,1619799171,"An ascending triangle can be seen more easily for example if there is a double top, which gives a horizontal line, and the bottom of the triangle is at a diagonal line. A wedge is essentially when both lines are at a diagonal line and neither are horizontal, a rising wedge is seen as bearish pattern, and an ascending triangle is bullish pattern. Hope that helps.

Edit: I had a quickly look on the daily chart on this for you for more clarity and the bearish pressure is where a double top formed for a first time which is the resistance line can now be seen. I would suggest it’s an ascending triangle pattern either way. As a suggestion I would learn about order blocks as it’s very helpful to learn about supply and demand zones.

n24a1b,,StockMarket,post,1619819300,"A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW OF AMC 

**I  am not a financial advisor and you could even waste your time reading  this, but I think it's necessary to express my insignificant opinion  about AMC. So I recommend, not to take with grain of salt everything  that you can read or dislike.**

I  know I know, amc is one of the largest theater chains in the world,  this world would not be the same without amc , Where we would take our  wife's boyfriend to see a movie if amc disappeared? Mmm…I don’t know,  but what I know is that AMC is in great trouble! YES you heard it right  “TROUBLE, PROBLEMA, ARGER, GUAIO, беда” whatever you want to call it.

**Let’s get straight to the point**

After  analyzing some Sec filings, one of the things that caught my attention  was the risk factor: the company is aware that COVID-19 has caused  several losses like: dismissal of staff, indebtedness, reduced income,  lower operating capacity, among other things. Although we see that  things have eased, and yet AMC theaters are operating between 50% and  60% of their total capacity, meanwhile, their debts have been increasing  and their income decreasing, for example, they mention that their  rental expenses are scheduled to increase in 2021, I assure you that  their rentals have increase but I’m too lazy to put them here.

But  anyways, it caught my attention because one of the risks that a company  has is that in the event of bankruptcy, which in my opinion is  completely credible with AMC, its holders of shares and other  securities, will probably suffer a total loss of their investment.  AMC  is aware that they have a tremendous debt and that the possibility of  not being able to pay for it is huge. As a consequence, they mention  that in the future there may be a dilution of shares (the issuance of  new shares causes the value of the shares to decrease) which would recur  in fatal losses for shareholders. I don't know if I'm wrong, but they  recently proposed to sell 500M shares and they backed off, but now they  have said they are ONLY going to offer 43M shares. But, will it be  enough to cover all of their debts?

**Let's see**

Its  total profit has decreased significantly in the last two years from  5,471M in 2019 to 1,242M in 2020 while its operating costs and expenses  have increased in those same years. I know know, some of us are way too  retarded to understand what this means: it´ll like saying your girls  boyfriend has another boyfriend that make you wonder why is your girls  boyfriend girlfriend. But if I told you that AMC has quadrupled its  losses compare to the year before and this represents -340.5% in loses,  you should be scared. I have heard people saying that this is not about  fundamentals because there are millions of shares being shorted, but do  you really think that other investors with high purchasing power looking  at statistics like this one are going to stay with their arms crossed?  Or do you think that what happened to GME in February was just because  of short interest? If you thought so, you are misinformed, fundamental  analysis played a very important roll.

But  anyways, it would not make sense to compare amc with gme because they  are completely different in fundamentals, Instead let me tell you that in   2014, a company called solarcity, a company  that built and rented  residential solar installations and at the same time was linked to Elon  Musk, seemed like the perfect company to invest in. However, the company  showed weaknesses in their financial sheets, their debts had been  increasing every year since 2009, solarcity optimistically told its  investors that the profits would come as there will be more registered  clients. Investors began buying a significant amount of shares causing  their prices to skyrocket by 634% in early 2014. But despite the  company's brilliant promises, investors ended up suffering as the  company had fallen by 65%. Without Musk, this company couldn’t have  survived. So what I want to get to with this example is that investors  including hedge funds who took into account the performance of the  company knew that the exaggeration in the price was not justified in  their balance sheet and began to take short positions while others  avoided massive losses…..

No more ruining the environment with empty syringes. No more complicated logistical problems slowing down the aim, the endgame, which is herd immunity.

Pipeline has so far demonstrated excellent results regarding the covid19 vaccine/norovirus/universal flu studies.

Covid19 vaccine phase 2 expected to start during Q2. Oral tablet, room temperature stable, eliminates any problems with logistics. Will be a key solution to vaccinate the developing world & boost the developed world. Emphasis is on it’s ability to target the S & N proteins, thus be effective even against any kind of mutations. Because believe me, this virus mutates, and it does so fast.

Possible collaboration with JNJ on the universal flu? Awaiting JNJ response, deadline approx 3rd May.

Active recruitment ongoing, many newly hired employees and available positions. Since Mid-March they have added enough postings to double their workforce and almost 50% of those hires would be in Quality Control and Manufacturing for a company that does not have a product yet.

n1i5gp,,StockMarket,post,1619741977,"Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

n1d2nt,,StockMarket,post,1619727112,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 29, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 29, 2021**

Stocks hit fresh record highs as market participants considered a batch of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports and new proposals from President Biden aimed at revamping the US’ infrastructure and supporting families, children, and students. The S&P 500 (SPY) hit a new intraday record, driven by gains in mega-cap stocks like Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), both of which reported blowout earnings. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Earnings season continues to deliver blowout results, with Apple and Facebook massively outperforming analyst expectations. Facebook’s stock, in particular, gapped up more than 7%. The strong results from these companies adds to a parade of mega-cap companies that have vastly outperformed estimates, driven by a surge in demand as the US economy gradually reopens thanks to effective vaccine distribution. According to FactSet, as of early Wednesday, companies comprising nearly half of the S&P 500's market capitalization had reported earnings results, with 83% of these corporations topping estimates, and by an average of 21.7%. 

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights** 

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims, week ended April 17:** 3.660 million vs. 3.590 million expected and a downwardly revised 3.651 million during the prior week
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. 
* The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday it is auditing Boeing Co's process for making minor design changes across its product line after a 737 MAX manufacturing issue grounded dozens of planes.

n1ffxn,,StockMarket,post,1619733742,"Question about risk and profit managementHi all, I've got to ask you about opinions and suggestions on my current risk and profit management.  


  
I've been using it about a while to a success but now I'm thinking that it might be tweaked a little.  


  
So basically I have four Risk Percent thresholds of possible losses: 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Each of these is correlated to Decimal Amount of profit (reward part of risk and reward), 10% is 0,25; 20% is 0,5; 30% is 1 and 40% is 2.  


When setting stop loss/take profit I first set my entry price. From that I calculate stop loss by doing simple equation: SL= Entry - (Entry \* Risk Percent).   


  
After SL is calculated I calculate take profit: TP= \[(Entry - SL)\* DecimalAmount \]+Entry  


So what do you guys think about it? I was thinking that I might be taking too little profit, especailly that I'm more of a swing/position trader.  
What would you guys suggest?",
n1ffxn,gwdrk9f,StockMarket,comment,1619752314,"I ignore price altogether and focus only on premium income. No stop losses because ultimately I end up with a zero cost basis which means everything is a profit or the stock runs. Those are my only two outcomes in ten years of trading this way. Even during the drop after covid, I ignored price and focused on premium. Bottom line, find a strategy that works for you. If you make money at a rate you are comfortable with then that's all that matters.",

n1ot2w,,StockMarket,post,1619768015,"WPP STRATEGY FOR GROWTH 2021We now provide services to clients through fewer, stronger, integrated creative agencies, industry-leading media agencies, global public relations agencies and specialist agencies.

Over the last two years, we have radically simplified our Company. We have fewer, stronger agency brands, better positioned to grow and fully equipped with the capabilities – from outstanding creativity to technology and data expertise – that modern clients demand. We are continuing to align our creative and digital credentials by bringing together AKQA and Grey; we are creating an ecommerce powerhouse by moving Geometry into VMLY&R to form VMLY&R Commerce; and we have merged three of our public relations agencies to establish global strategic communications firm Finsbury Glover Hering.

Our agencies are the platforms for our future growth: our integrated creative agencies, with their excellence in digital communications and increasingly important skills in experience and ecommerce; our industry-leading media agencies, which continue to dominate new business rankings and have been the engine of WPP for many years; our public relations agencies, whose role has been so critical for clients during the turbulence of the last year; and our specialist agencies, which provide a range of services to meet every client need.

By investing more in our agencies and their capabilities, we aim to return our core communications business to sustainable growth while expanding further into the high-growth areas of commerce, experience and technology, which we expect to increase from 25% of our business today to 40% by 2025.

n143o4,,StockMarket,post,1619702127,"LUCID AIR REVEALS AMP-1 EVForget about the marketing and focus on how Lucid will make its cars.

Peter Rawlinson is not only Lucid’s CEO but also the company’s CTO: Chief Technical Officer. That said, he must know every bit of every process the company developed to create its cars. Yet, he managed to play surprised in this video in which Peter Hochholdinger, Lucid’s VP of Manufacturing, presents the production processes of AMP-1. Forget about the marketing attempt and focus on the real deal: how Lucid will make its cars.

The visit to the plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, allowed us to see the factory is pretty ordinary in most of its aspects. All car manufacturing sites have a body shop, a paint shop, and a general assembly area. Far from being a disappointment, this can be a relief for investors: Lucid will follow a well-known recipe for making its cars.

Not by chance, most of the video describes the paint shop. When AMP-1 is at full production capacity, it will be able to handle 365,000 vehicles per year. In this first phase, it will paint 34,000 cars annually. Lucid already presented the paint shop in a previous video, and it seems to be pretty proud of its quality, an Achilles’ heel for some of its competitors.
The body shop presents a few innovations, such as the own robots working as fixture stations. Fixtures are fundamental for the body geometry to be absolutely perfect. Any deviation on any side will represent problems with gaps, water leaks, and wind noise, apart from other unpredictable issues. That means these robots have to be very, very precise.

Finally, the assembly line shows that the battery pack joins the body at the end of the process. If it were a structural component, it would have to be integrated into the vehicle much earlier. Although that presents advantages in cost, it may penalize serviceability.
Lucid is promising to give its customers an impeccable car. It even postponed deliveries to make sure the first Air owners will not regret being early adopters. Let’s hope that is not just marketing talk.

**Thesis-** The stock market is at an unsustainable high valuation and when tracking historical times of similar booms we see a sharp pullback in the years following a squeeze of like magnitude. High speculation coupled with total uncertainty in rate tapering timing will lead to a 30+% correction in the summer of 2021. Retail spending will be at ATH, supply shortages will be at ATH, and inflation levels will spike to 2009-2010 levels.

**Graph #1 - Bank Of America Global Research Sell Side Indicator**\*(this charts buy and sell signals based on 15year averages)\*

[Currently we are less than one point from a sell indication(blue line nearing red line). In history, corrections occur directly following a sell signal call.](https://preview.redd.it/ydij4ihjfmw61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=f611bea4713da9a7257ba2708dd8a0e9b595960e)

**Graph #2 - VIX/VXV**\*( the VIX is a real-time market index representing the market’s expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days, the lesser know VXV measures implied volatility three months out. One way to look at fear/greed is to use the VIX divided by the VXV: VIX/VXV ratio )\*

[The current VIX/VXV ratio sits at 0.754. When the rate is about this low, vertical blue lines, returns for the S&P500 are often less than stellar. Namely, in 2012 the S&P500 lost 10-14% eventually. In 2015 the index stalled almost a year, adding a mere 3.5%, only to lose nearly 15%. Similarly, in 2016, albeit the pullback was shallow (-5%). In 2017 there were several <0.75 readings, and the market ignored those, gaining almost 20% since the first reading in August 2020 but losing at least 6% since the last <0.75 reading from December 2020. Besides, less low readings, like in 2018 and 2019, can still lead to 20% losses.](https://preview.redd.it/wt3l6uw7imw61.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&s=10d9ec18390ed9a56dfd4908687db964456e330f)

**Graph #3 - Fibonacci Retracement** *(Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate the possible locations of support and resistance levels. It shows how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The direction of the previous trend is likely to continue. However, the price of the asset usually retraces to one of the ratios listed above before that happens. )*

[The white lines are the resistance levels at 8 month intervals. The 5th sequence of the cycle usually results in the further move to the downside. Following this trend, the 5th wave would happen between july and september 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/u2kxm0abjmw61.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=f99b4385974681a7d962fa060f3789f94808a0ef)

**Graph #4- VIX Bollinger Bands** *( Bollinger Bands are curves drawn in and around the price structure usually consisting of a moving average (the middle band), an upper band, and a lower band that answer the question as to whether prices are high or low on a relative basis.* *The narrow bands suggest a period of low volatility. Widening bands suggest an increase in volatility often associated with a trending market environment )*

[In the graph, we see the VIX(Tracks options volatility) at two time periods: 2008 Recession & Present Day. In 2008 we saw the VIX fall through 2009 and into early 2010 as the economy was bailed out. Bollinger bands leveled out at peak separation from top and bottom bands which led to a market sell off shortly after, further lengthening the economic recovery. Following this trend we are in the same cycle as post 2008 recovery, with the markets speculation growing towards a potential catalyst in the form of an interest, tax or wage rate hike.](https://preview.redd.it/mgqaw23ckmw61.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f3bb372d06e78930b81efa8e1f2ba5067f546f)

**CONCLUSION**: History shows us there is cycles to our financial nature as human beings, analysis shows us the cycle end is nearing. Overvaluation, abundance of cash, and supply restrictions will ultimately lead to a correction in anticipation of coming inflation.

**PREDICTIONS** Federal reserve begins slowing asset purchasing in June and overvalued mid and small cap stocks will sell off to offset heavy weighted holdings( lowers taxes with realized losses), by July 4th news reports on lay offs from material shortages will begin, July and August will be red, and September-December will be a recovery back to 200 day moving averages.

Hi fellow traders, this is my first time posting on WSB and wanted to share with you some TA using volume price analysis on CLOV. I got interested in CLOV recently and having profited a lot on GME (bought in shares and options in November). I felt this was my next big bet.

First of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4oo9rdmdlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d7e1ed18232b575526ec194f840d47fddaa3f4

On the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn’t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn’t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don’t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.

P.S.: Don’t take my word for it and do your own DD.

***Revenue Model***

***…***

Their membership acquisition is highly seasonal, with January being the highest enrollment month as a result of Medicare’s annual election period at the end of the year. Their members generally enroll for a full calendar year, creating a highly predictable revenue stream for that year and meaningful opportunities for them to re-enroll members for years to come.

***Member Enrollment***

Their revenue growth rate and long-term profitability are affected by their ability to increase their number of members, which requires that they both continue to enroll new members in their MA plans and retain existing members. Their membership expanded from **42,592** as of December 31, 2019, to **58,056** as of December 31, 2020\*\*, an increase of 15,464 members\*\*, primarily under Medicare’s annual election period process.

***Market Coverage***

They are focused on driving membership growth through geographic and market share expansion and are allocating resources and taking strategic actions to increase Their share in existing markets and enter into new markets. As a result, their revenue, growth rate and long-term profitability are also affected by their ability to achieve both objectives. **As of December 31, 2020**, they **offered plans in 34 MA markets across seven states** with **8% market** **share** of the individual, non-special needs plans (“non-SNP”) MA enrollees in these markets. **They have launched in 74 additional MA markets, expanding their footprint by an additional state, in 2021.**

**Total Revenue Growth YOY 2019-2020:** **46%**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**MACHINE LEARNING IS THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY**

They are singularly focused on creating great, sustainable healthcare to improve every life. They have centered Their strategy on building and deploying technology that they believe **will enable them to solve a significant data problem while avoiding the limitations of legacy approaches**. Currently, as a next-generation Medicare Advantage insurer, they leverage their flagship software platform, the Clover Assistant, to provide America’s seniors with PPO and HMO plans that are the obvious choice for Medicare-eligible consumers.

They call Their plans “Obvious” because they believe they are highly affordable—offering most of Their members the lowest average out-of-pocket costs for primary care physician co-pays, specialist co-pays, drug deductibles and drug costs in their markets—and provide wide network access and the same cost-sharing (co-pays and deductibles) for physicians who are in- and out-of-network. **By empowering physicians with data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care through their software platform, they believe they can improve clinical decision-making and viably offer these “Obvious” plans at scale, through an asset-light approach. They reach a broad array of consumers, including traditionally underserved populations.**

They drive adoption and use of the Clover Assistant across their network of primary care physicians (“PCPs”) by focusing on continuously improving its user-centric design, highly actionable and real-time clinical content, enhanced and rapid payment for Clover Assistant visits and simple onboarding.

As of December 31, 2020, over 2,400 PCPs had contracted to use the Clover Assistant to manage Their members’ care. High PCP engagement with the Clover Assistant enables real-time, data-driven decision-making for Their members at the point of care and drives rapid software iteration\*\*: the more that physicians use the Clover Assistant, the more it learns\*\* and furthers the precision of personalized data-driven recommendations. **They combine their payor data with physician-generated data and use this powerful closed feedback loop to continuously tune their clinical rules and machine learning models**, as well as to select and prioritize future software capabilities.

**The use and continuous improvement of the Clover Assistant has resulted in not only improved clinical decision-making but also strong plan performance.** The platform also facilitates identifying and engaging with their most at-risk members for their clinical programs designed to provide additional targeted care support, which is designed to further drive better plan performance. Taken together, they believe these enhancements will allow them to return a material portion of their savings to members through their “Obvious” plans and to continuously lower their members’ out-of-pocket costs and provide them with market-leading benefits.

My Position:  Long

I like the fundamental play.  The 39M shares short + 330,000 May21 Calls open with the Monday, May 17th Earnings Date for the company are just icing on the cake for potential upside.

**ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Clover has moved up their release of earnings to Monday morning at 8:30am EST on May 17th.  330,000+ call options are open with a May 21st expiration.  Rarely do companies release negative earnings on a Monday morning.**

n2osrx,,wallstreetbets,post,1619895402,"Just what is going on with Vaxart? Up to date with VXRT and why I am betting this stock will potentially climb to higher highs (at least 2x).Edit 1: This post gained some traction. I just want to say this is a straight-up gamble. A: A classic pump and dump by the ceo to raise funds for their research/lab. Or B: They actually have updated results from their phase 1 trial that is promising. Stock is up 100% since last week. The two events/catalysts I listed are priced in. 

However, will we see another >= 50% run-up this week? What factors can contribute to another >50% run-up? 

Answer: We see a disgusting report/results from their phase 1 trial and how their oral covid pill matched up with other competitors in their T-Cell response. Their antibodies results, they're not really showing off. So I would be wary on their antibodies numbers. It is also antibodies from mucosal, which I think is different than the immune system. But from here we see:

 source: [https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1213](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1213) \- mucusal immunity paper 

The mucosal immune system three main functions are to 1) protect the mucous membranes against airbone microbes. 2) to prevent uptake of antigens from aribone matter and 3) prevent development of harmful immune response to these antigens if they reach to the body interior (i.e. past the mucuous system and into the cardiac system, lungs, stomach, digestive/ immune system). 

&#x200B;

I am bullish on their mucosal antibodies: I have a feeling they will show an updated phase 1 trial showing an increase in their results on antibodies of mucosal system. However, will this protect covid itself?

&#x200B;

Answer: 

source: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.611337/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.611337/full) \- mucosal immunity in covid-19

"" The mucosal immune system is the largest component of the entire immune system, having evolved to provide protection at the main sites of infectious threat: the mucosae. "" Covid initially infects the upper respiratory tract. However, it first interactions with the immune system occurs at the mucousal. 

"" Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing now for several months, very little attention has been given to mucosal immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection ""

The research paper then goes on to describe covid and how it may pass through a human's system. And in short they said, "" This means that its interactions with the immune system, during both inductive and effector phases, must first occur predominantly if not exclusively at the respiratory and oral mucosae. "" 

&#x200B;

A bunch of medical terms no idea what 50% of it is saying but it leads me to conclude that covid first starts at the mucousal immune system (through the eyes and nose). And this covid pill from VXRT will present data on mucuousal antibodies from their phase 1 trial.

Summary: n = 20 us citizens 

triggered multiple immune response:

1) T-Cells response to the viral protein, necessary for long-lasting immunity. T cells are a type of white blood cell that have multiple functions. They either stimulate cells to produce antibodies or become memory T cells (this makes immune system register and remember viruses). 

2) T-Cell responded to the viral S protein. From the words of Dr. Thomas, ""V **iral variants with altered S proteins are becoming established in the population before the majority of people can be vaccinated. To end the pandemic, the world needs a vaccine that can provide long-lasting protection from emerging strains ... T-cells can provide long-lasting cross-reactive protection against current and emerging strains of the virus. Our vaccine induced a high percentage of responding CD8+** **T cells against both Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins, which may provide protection against variants with alterations in the faster-changing S protein. We expect that our vaccine will be less impacted by new variants than injectable vaccines,”.** 

Summary: T-cells response in S proteins. Longer lasting immunity and potential less impact by new variants than the needle vaccines.

&#x200B;

3) **No antibodies present on cotton swabs of 2 SUBJECTS. This caused the stock go from $24 to $9.** Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections. They swabbed 2 people out of 20 people. 

&#x200B;

Bull: If antibodies are present in results and in high number, this stock is going to the moon. Also, T-cells relationship with antibodies, what of it that caused them to go to the world vaccine of the doggone congress.

&#x200B;

Answer: When a virus enters a cell.. it gets picked up by our body's surveillance. The MHC Class II molecules circle back to the cell and present the virus to passing cells. This in turn activates the other cells's T Cells. The helper T Cells stimulates B Cells to produce antibodies. The killer T Cells find and kill infected cells with the virus (they are memory cells). So their Terminator Cells. 

Because viruses spread so fast, this process is crucial and needs to be just as fast. T Cells can recognize influenza-infected cells within 1.5 hours.  T-cells also use cytokines as messenger molecules to send chemical instructions to the rest of the immune system to ramp up its response.

&#x200B;

Wait guys, WALL STREET BET of the week: Their FEB TRIAL SHOWED NO ANTIBODIES FROM 2 SUBJECTS. ON MAY THEY WILL PRESENT THEIR T CELLS RESULTS AND THEY KNOW THEY CRUSHED THE COMPETITION ON T CELLS. But what about antibodies? Well.. here's this again: 

"" The Company will also present new mucosal antibody data and review the recent Phase I clinical results that suggest VXA-CoV2-1 is potentially protective against new and emerging COVID-19 strains. ""

A huge shoutout to the stoner guy for posting a Vaxart DD last Thursday getting this onto WSB's attention. Well, I bought some this Friday based on this guy's conviction. Should I buy more this coming Monday? Well say no more, I am onto this DD..

What is Vaxart?

source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-present-world-vaccine-congress-120000069.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-present-world-vaccine-congress-120000069.html)

Vaxart is a clinical biotech company developing oral vaccines. They are designed to be stored at room temperature and offer much more convenience than traditional needles in terms of storage, shipping, and handling. Its current development programs include oral vaccines for COVID, norovirus, seasonal flu, and other respiratory viruses. They have filed a number of domestic and international patents protecting their technology behind these oral vaccines.

Summary: Bio-tech company with a covid pill. Legitimate patents worldwide and domestically.

Question: What made them shoot up 100% in one month?

Answer: Well first, there were two events that were the catalyst for this rise. One catalyst happened in April 26-27. And the second one happened in April 29.

First catalyst: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-120000167.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-120000167.html)

Summary: On April 26th, Vaxart announced it will host a webinar on Monday, May 3rd 12 EST discussing the importance of T-cell responses generated from vaccines and how it can determine if it is effective against prevention. ""  Early reports of vaccine efficacy focused on antibody production, but the ability to engage T-cells may be an important factor in determining which vaccines are most effective. "" Essentially this quote is saying how you know in vaccine development, antibodies are the single most important factor for an immune response to a novel virus entering the immune system. However, this webinar focuses on how T-cells might just be as important as antibodies. Vaxart will bring in T-cell expert Mark Davis, Ph.D., Stanford University School of Medicine, to report on the importance of T-cell immunity in COVID-19 vaccines. And guess what Vaxart will show? ""

So fuckin bullish on this statement alone \^... So that news announcement shot up Vaxart 50%.

&#x200B;

[Vaxart jumped 50&#37; on April 27th due to the first catalyst](https://preview.redd.it/sqxxoj8ozjw61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f10a50d604e55f0d94bd249e61a7301e5844de)

Second catalyst: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-present-world-vaccine-congress-120000069.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaxart-present-world-vaccine-congress-120000069.html)

Summary: As if their own webinar T-Cell focused was not enough to present. Vaxart also announced they will present at the **World Vaccine Congress 2021** on May 4-6, 2021\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

[World Vaccine Congress details](https://preview.redd.it/q0dgc5nxzjw61.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9b4363402d1b8dc3f0ce16a05dce44a9ddee9fe)

Dr. Tucker, Vaxart's founder and chief scientific officer, will provide insight into Vaxart's response to addressing Covid-19 with their room-temperature oral vaccine. Guys, this is the World Vaccine Congress, they wouldn't be presenting if they did not have important shit to say.

&#x200B;

Oh fuck I just realized something, if they are presenting this Monday on their T-Cell and antibody results from their trials, they must have great ass news. Because a couple of days later they will be presenting to the world vaccine congress. You wouldn't present a shit project to your co-worker and then present it to the manager a couple of days later right?

&#x200B;

Anyways, I have no idea how to value this stock. All I know is that stonks go up. And this bad boy is sitting at 1.15 bn market cap. VXRT is the only preventative oral vaccine for covid to this date. The Pfizer one is a treatment. There are many countries outside the USA starving for vaccines in the near future as well (ex: India, Japan, some/most of Europe, Canada) and they have the beta AZ vaccine. Let's just see how this oral vaccine will do. This is a casino and I am just rolling some dice with the bros. But in this case, the odds are with us.

Note: I will add more to this post with updated DD and research.

This stock is shit. This stock is so shit, it’s rated as one of MarketBeat’s worst stocks to invest in. This is why people are often shorting. Attached is a link to MarketWatch’s report of short sale/interest history since last November.

[Aurora Cannabis ACB Short Sale Data](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ACB/short-interest/)

Date - $ACB Underlying - Total Shares Sold Short

04/15/21 - $7.79 - 36,420,000

Aurora Cannabis is extremely volatile in those data points from November and December. As short interest approaches 40,000,000, the underlying stock price jumps upward. When approaching 40,000,000, there is difficulty covering shorts. You will notice when Aurora Cannabis has a massive price spike, the short interest drops rapidly from the point near 40,000,000.

In periods of low volume, bulls are holding and 🌈 🐻 are in extreme anxiety with the upcoming earnings report release. Those high price points in November and December came on from shorts placed at lower price points, subsequently pushing the price into those $10+ scenarios when unable to cover.

On the trading day of Friday April 30th, the volume was extremely low at 3.42M shares traded. People are quietly asking around to borrow ACB shares at major interest rates for shorts which make it unprofitable (60-70% instead of the traditional 5-20%).

With 36,420,000 shorts and an earnings report coming on 05/13 after-hours, Aurora Cannabis ACB is going to rise from $8.85 to over $10 by Friday, May 7th. On Monday, May 10th, volatility city is coming. The price will instantly jump all over the fucking place.

I bought tons of ACB $12c 05/21. I plan to sell between 05/11-05/14. Unusual options activity highlighted ACB $9c 05/21 on Barcharts. After I sell the Calls, I will switch to out-of-the-money Puts set to expire in June with all my profits.

I know tons of you are common stock bag holders. Let’s get your money back with options. I don’t care if you get rich on calls or puts. They’re both going to work when the stock has a bi-polar episode in the month of May.

Your Car Is About To Be a Software Platform, Subscriptions and All  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/your-car-is-about-to-be-a-software-platform-subscriptions-and-all

Read this article and tell me that BB is not smack bang in the middle of this. 

1) Auto companies increasingly focused on software to optimize car performance and deliver on demand services. This is the way things are going and this trend towards a connected “smart” car is only accelerating. 

2) Safety and security are key when it comes to introducing software into vehicles. And this shit is super complex so no reasonable Auto OEM (except maybe TSLA) will try to develop a proprietary in house software solution at significant cost. 

3) Luckily there is also a superb off the shelf solution to OEM’s available in the form of QNX and IVY. BB quietly worked on this over the past years without getting any attention and now BB is the de facto leader in automotive software solutions with safety and security a key competence of the firm. 

4) Now its time to monetize all that hard work. BB already has 23/25 of the global auto OEMs signed up as customers so we will begin to see these partnerships translate into sales. In the next 5 years most if not all new cars will have some kind of BB software embedded inside.

n2ojmq,,wallstreetbets,post,1619894655,"Cohu; the plug for your favorite semiconductor companiesWhat if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. 

Cohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. 

**Bullish trends**

1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. 
2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?
3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Nvidia are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.
4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.
5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. 

**Bearish trends**

1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). 
2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. 
3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).

**Fundamental analysis**

I use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing).

Cohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000

$316 million/$1925 million=6.09

This is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. 

Cohu-6.09

aapl-19.12

amzn-18

ter-11.3

advantest-7.19

swks-17.9

If cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.

Taking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \~$200 million today versus \~$300 million a year ago.

As we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. 

In conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). 

Disclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company.

This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9

 Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan’21 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007

 Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.

**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.

**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.

**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm – Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.

**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Can I use the code/is it open source: Yes.

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

# TL;DR

**$130 calls on September 17 🚀 🚀 🚀**

**Expectation: Acquisition by Google.**

I discuss how to think about Fastly as an investment to folks who have reasoned that investing in cloud compute and networking is a good idea but may not necessarily understand how or why it’s a good idea. We focus on basic networking and the consequences of “serverless” computing; an architecture that has gained popularity in recent years.

I’ve written about Cloudflare before in May 2020, on an account called u/codingprofessor, before taking DD writing more seriously. I claimed that Cloudflare would blow past $60 dollars and was critically undervalued due to COVID economics, their current position in web security, and serverless computing. I still view that Cloudflare and Fastly can both reach 40B+ marketcaps by 2023.

&#x200B;

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that often gets filtered out.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation. Here are some recent DDs:

# Cloudflare vs. Fastly

**- TL;DR Fastly makes stuff faster, Cloudflare is more general purpose. They can be used together.**

[Support](https://preview.redd.it/8nw4s6mlojw61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7)

This is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike. In my view, the comparison isn’t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces. Fastly is focused on real-time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers. Cloudflare is a general network competitor. You can use both, and most do.

&#x200B;

[General purpose needs](https://preview.redd.it/8g9lk7uhwjw61.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6)

In a crude sense, Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco, while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart. It’s not to say that one is better than the other, because it's not. They just solve different problems with completely different approaches. You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart, but when you go to Costco, you're picking up and utilizing a lot more.

This explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co-operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage, Spotify network meshes, Google Cloud services, and other real-time demands from the tech industry.

&#x200B;

>""While a convenience store is generally closer to a person's home, it has a limited set of items for sale. If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip. In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN's with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly's approach with fewer, larger ones.""

&#x200B;

Cloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet - it wants to make the internet more accessible, safer, and fair. Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet. So in a nutshell, one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution.

An example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit’s execution of the r/place experiment in 2017 - which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real-time.

[Real-time collaboration services meets art and communtiy.](https://i.redd.it/2kf4qnoorjw61.gif)

This is only one example of many. The way I like to frame it is by viewing real-time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need, and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services. You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify, Ticketmaster, or The New York Times - all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management.

[world-class research](https://preview.redd.it/m9muspwsrjw61.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1)

A big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world-class from top to bottom, from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence. They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition. They research, experiment, and execute on the boundary of networking, making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view.

The result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used.  This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time. They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike.

&#x200B;

[the capex equation](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1xm5zrjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c)

Cloudflare's team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare's ability to be compliant to global requirements. This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long-term, Fastly's general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network.

The compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly's speeds, in the microseconds, is exponentially faster than Cloudflare's serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range. This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman, who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long-term.

[Matt Prince's Hierarchy of Developer's Needs](https://preview.redd.it/9afefjyasjw61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1)

Why does this distinction matter? Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical, like hospital communications, stock market crashes, wildfires, or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network?

&#x200B;

>The way to think about this is, what do you pay for, right? I mean if you -- and where are these moments that are valuable. When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again, that matters, that moment matters. Everyone is going to tweet about it, and everyone wants to see it, the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content. When you send a gift across the Internet, like it's not monetized in the same way, it's not as valued.. So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer, where they're willing to pay for it and the quality, and the security and the scale of that deeply matters. And we have always focused our work on that type of content. There's plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity. Every month, they want a lower price. That's a different market from our perspective, and we're not in it."" - Fastly CEO

# Understanding Content Delivery

**- TL;DR You have data, you cut the data into smaller pieces, send it across a network, and rebuild those pieces somewhere else.**

[The global cache](https://preview.redd.it/a92mp9wesjw61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98e66b61a7b13f89a4556399c8264a038bb16ac)

It’s helpful to understand the 7  steps that protocols take as they travel across and through a network around the world. This model is known as the OSI model and it’s not necessarily the end-all-be-all model that governs the internet; but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance.

There are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research. At the same time, many of these steps follow a similar process - translate or transform the data that’s received and sent.

&#x200B;

[Edge computing, an extension of the cloud.](https://preview.redd.it/r5k1yknbyjw61.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=60bbe4420f4025c8c791d62c569453ce82a8a8b0)

For example, the web browser translates the data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals. This may not make too much sense yet, but just remember that it’s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware.

&#x200B;

[Email, zoom calls, pins, streams, different network flavors.](https://preview.redd.it/kvhajfjtujw61.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2570ebd03b9fd5c08989b0b5551d9eea2c5c3c44)

&#x200B;

1. **Application Layer:** You initiate a Zoom call. It has passed through the application layer using an real-time messaging protocol. It sends the video to the presentation layer.
2. **Presentation Layer:** The video data is received and compressed. It gets sent to the session layer.
3. **Session Layer:** A communication session is initiated. A network communication is initiated, with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes.
4. **Transportation Layer:** The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation.
5. **Network Layer:** Once the data has reached this stage, the segments are converted to packets.
6. **Data Link Layer:** The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer.
7. **Physical Layer:** The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation, which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable.

&#x200B;

[OSI Model](https://preview.redd.it/68fe020vsjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f4ae86782c3c87978af6e4a9bf46d1b0f695347)

As the data reaches its destination, it goes through the 7 layer process again in the opposite direction, where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer (the person who you sent an Zoom call to). There’s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times.

What are the complexities related to delivering a letter, a box of clothes, or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood? So that’s the essence behind content-delivery networks - preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths.

It’s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this. They may be words or ideas that you’ve heard - routers, bitstreams, addresses, and so on. What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin, playing a Spotify stream, or setting up a Zoom call without a video? How do we utilize location data when it comes to COVID containment efforts? What are the consequences of correcting a news article, fact checking a social media post, or reconciling the differences in video game connections in a game like Call of Duty?

&#x200B;

[Networking meets human experiences](https://preview.redd.it/d5nbigz1tjw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=d39cdad6269f4b7d224fff12e6c39adc60584d60)

With this developing model in mind, consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network, while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further. They seek to solve different platforms, while having obvious overlaps at the same time.

# Serverless Compute - The Event Driven Network

**TL;DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products.**

[The event driven network](https://preview.redd.it/lhez9rq6tjw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7)

What serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network. There are two major benefits to serverless computing:

1. It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box.

For example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless ""function-as-a-service"" can provide that capacity for a developer.

https://preview.redd.it/bm6jwodptjw61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd

That image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well. Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area, edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location.

&#x200B;

[Functions as a service](https://preview.redd.it/1trzui6ctjw61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3)

2. It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure tosupport it.

Imagine that a product that benefits off real-time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers. A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob-in-the-hood during spikes of activity or Reddit's own ability to handle surges of logins, registrations, and activity after events like GME's stock market explosion. Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft's expansion releases, where servers were effectively ""on fire"" and required round-the-clock support.

Edge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective. If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1,000,000 users, a serverless architecture allows for intelligent ""autoscaling"" - which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me. This ultimately results in a metered pay-as-you-go system.

&#x200B;

[The network as a utility](https://preview.redd.it/hq7l51wwtjw61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f88e8d28b452a5bf0a7d0c560e22e8b2ba0f7a)

The combination of these two benefits is pretty powerful, allowing a developer to essentially start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace. I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing. Here are some simple questions I like to think about:

[we've all been there.](https://preview.redd.it/ydk0hfx7ujw61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9)

\- Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies?

\- How do we improve the security of individual network-connected devices?

\- Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching?

\- Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences?

\- Will online video games require servers bounded by location?

\- Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream?

\- Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics?

\- Are we able to extend programmability to ""node"" based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations?

&#x200B;

Some of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves, as they list the following subjects of interest in their S-1:

1. **API acceleration**. Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences, such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real-time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts;
2. **IoT**. Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time-sensitive applications;
3. **Cloud migration**. Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments, enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers
4. **Enabling redactedchain (block)**. Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain (block) in real time.

# Conclusion

TL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.

You may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report. Those things need to just check out.","['AMZN', 'WMT', 'HD', 'GOOGL', 'ADSK', 'KSU']"

n1t0yz,,wallstreetbets,post,1619786577,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market. 

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/oo61ht373bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8d785445785475c739f84ea3638bb820420bb2

As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark.  

https://preview.redd.it/qo4xaop93bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bf4985e21430a811827242ce9b3587e9a4ae25a

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

n24jla,,wallstreetbets,post,1619820118,"INFLATION NATION The current economic data being released combined with recent statements from large corporations about pricing should be ringing inflation alarm bells. It’s not just meme stocks that are mooning, the price of everything is going thru the roof. Could it be that the inevitable hangover from the money printer going BRRRRR is approaching? I have no idea, but the numbers are staggering.

Let’s look past the bullshit CPI which registered 2.6% for the March reading. The everyday items you and I consume are going up by much larger amounts than the FEDs favorite inflation gauge. Take housing prices for example, which everyone knows are going up at a crazy rate. February year over year increase was 12% nationally and shows no sign of slowing down. In my area, houses are selling in days at 20-25% over list. But the CPI doesn’t reflect this. The CPI tries to estimate housing inflation using “owner equivalent rent” which is what a homeowner would pay to rent their own house. The cost of the house is ignored in this equation, the focus being on the cost of the shelter it provides instead. That’s great, unless you want to buy a house. 

The prices of just about everything that it takes to build that house are going up too. The price of a new lot to build on is up 11% YOY and will likely continue to climb as supply of new lots is down 20% in that same period. The materials that make up the home are up as follows:

Lumber: +67% YTD

Copper: +27% YTD

Gypsum: +7% YOY

Steel Mill Products: +18% YOY

Add in a shortage of construction workers, a national push for higher wages and ultra-low interest rates and housing shows no signs of becoming more affordable anytime soon. 

Fulfilment costs are going up across the board as well, due to numerous factors. Disruptions in the global shipping markets have led to price increases of 25-50% on shipping containers. A shortage of U.S. truck drivers will also lead to higher shipping costs, as well as having the add on affect of raising the cost of gas. Typically, 10% of U.S. tanker capacity is idle, currently it is 20-25% idle due to the shortage. Summer driving season is approaching. This may cause a feedback loop of higher gas prices as supply struggles to keep up with demand, negatively impacting consumers and businesses alike. 

To compound the aforementioned issues, the prices of the commodities and inputs used to produce a broad range of goods are also increasing rapidly. Look at these increases in just the last month alone:

Cocoa: +2.5%

Coffee: +12.7%

Sugar: +13.6%

Lean Hogs: +6.3%

Rough Rice: +3.6%

Oats: +7.4%

Soybeans: +7.7%

Wheat: +18%

Corn: +18.5%

Farmers are now substituting wheat grown for human consumption as animal feed due to the huge increase in the price of corn. This feedstock inflation can trickle thru the butcher block and dairy isle and potentially increase prices of meat, chicken, milk, eggs and cheese, just to name a few. 

In the recent earnings calls of several multi-national corporations the topic of pricing and supply chain issues was highlighted. Coke and Pepsi are both going to raise prices, and if you look at the price of sugar, the reason is obvious. P&G and Mondelez both announced intentions to do the same, and Kraft spoke about rising costs across it supply chains. Selling a smaller amount for the same price isn’t gonna cut it this time anymore. Prices are going up. 

So, inflation appears to be working its way thru commodities markets and supply chains and will soon be knocking on the door. Printer’s days of going BRRRR may be catching up with us. Don’t worry though, you likely won’t be affected. Unless you live inside, drive, eat, drink coffee or pop, shop online or have anything to do with those industries, you’ll be just fine!",

n2ip93,,wallstreetbets,post,1619876954,"$NNDM - May literally 3D Print Solid ReturnsNano Dimension $NNDM

Company Description (From their website)

Nano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.

**Sounds cool, doesn't it?** Anyways, here's some information on the company and some short term catalysts.

**Where They Can Sell**

In several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. Most recently, in March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station.

**Cathie Wood**

She is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\* as of 4/30/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.

ARKQ (8,425,766 Shares)

ARKW (5,383,591 Shares)

IZRL (789,242 Shares)

PRNT (1,934,283 Shares)

**Revenue**

It's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.

In 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.

In pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.

\*As stated on their earnings call, no guidance was given\*

**Cash on hand**

Every time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION

(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)

Yes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.

To put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.

**Acquisitions**

The company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)

So far, they've acquired two companies in the past two weeks (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)

DeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)

NanoFabrica (3D Printing - \*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\~$59 Million TOTAL - \~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \*The final numbers are not confirmed\*

So they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.

Their plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.

Type A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!

Type B - Technologies they think their machines need

Type C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.

**Unusual Option Activity**

Specifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.

May 21st Options (\*As of 4/30/21)

$7.50 - 35,197 Open Interest

$10.00 - 35,875 Open Interest

$12.50 - 22,308 Open Interest

Should also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.

$7.50 PUT - 20,552 Open Interest

**Stock Activity**

I'm not much of a stock chart analyst, and I don't think ""technicals"" matter for a stock like this. If you take a look at the YTD chart, it's pretty ugly. Ever since February, $NNDM and plenty of other ""growth"" stocks have been hit hard. After a high of $17.89, it's fallen as low as the low $6.00 range. 

**Upcoming Catalysts** 

* Earnings are expected to be around mid-may. Last earnings, despite low numbers (for this stock revenue isn't that important yet) the stock ran up from mid $6 range to over $11 in under 2 weeks.
* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release by summer time.
* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 the past 2 weeks)

**Two Good Articles Worth Reading**

A very bullish article was posted to Yahoo Finance last week on Nano Dimension, and it's worth the read.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html))

*""This is a $1.8 billion company. The PCB market is marching towards $70-plus billion in value. Nano Dimension is sitting on a breakthrough technology that could disrupt that entire market.*

*Long term, you’re talking a potentially multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity, the likes of which could easily result in a $10-plus billion valuation…""*

Cathie Wood actually briefly mentioned Nano Dimension during an interview.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-shares-thoughts-nano-122015778.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-shares-thoughts-nano-122015778.html))

*A key quote from her is ""We always look for where the defense is putting their money""*

**The Negatives**

* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%) 
* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash
* COVID is still impacting Europe, and they have a decent customer base out there

n2ol9x,,wallstreetbets,post,1619894796,"Defending QuantumScape**Opportunity:** There's a case to be made about $QS. A company whose actually trying to do some good by creating an EV battery that is smaller, more efficient and creates less waste than current available technology. The EV battery market is expected to reach 67 billion dollars by 2025. QS is a high risk high reward proposition that has recently suffered a short attack from a hedge fund with a bad reputation for releasing over exaggerated claims to tank stocks.

[https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-battery-market-100188347.html](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-battery-market-100188347.html)

**Short Attack:** The short attack was accompanied by a long report with ""battery experts"" and former employees. Most of these claims surrounded issues with the battery technology itself. In reading the report, I don't see anything beyond typical problems that a company creating new technology would face (nothing that the average investor wouldn't already know). The report goes on and on slamming the CEO and the company for various actions and statements. On a personal note, reading through it made me sick. How is it that this is not market manipulation? The report spreads fear and tanks the stock right as they take a huge short interest.

[https://wccftech.com/a-short-seller-claims-that-quantumscape-qs-shared-only-nice-powerpoint-slides-with-volkswagen-vw-even-though-the-solid-state-battery-cells-were-tested-in-volkswagens-own/](https://wccftech.com/a-short-seller-claims-that-quantumscape-qs-shared-only-nice-powerpoint-slides-with-volkswagen-vw-even-though-the-solid-state-battery-cells-were-tested-in-volkswagens-own/)

**QS Reply:** The CEO has replied by stating they strongly believe in their technology, although they can't release any specifics (proprietary technology) they stand behind their work. Honestly, I don't think they have anything to prove at the moment. The company indeed won't generate revenue for another couple of years but they have never claimed to be able to. They have an investor in Bill gates and VW - who has tested the batteries in their own lab and chose to continue their investment.

**From VW:** “We are pleased to report that the QuantumScape cells met the technical milestones in our labs in Germany that we had previously agreed upon,” said Frank Blome, head of the Volkswagen Group’s Center of Excellence Battery Cell. “Achievement of this milestone is an important step for QuantumScape, and we look forward to receiving and testing subsequent generations of cells to get solid-state technology into series production.”

**Potential Catalyst:**

1. Biden proposes a 174 billion dollar investment into the EV space as part of his 2.25 trillion dollar infrastructure plan. The money will go to incentives for individuals to move into the EV space along with investing in future technology.

2) The company reports earnings 5/11 - (last earnings report saw a spike in stock price over 30%)

**TL:DR:** I see a company with huge upside, market expectation 67 billion by 2025, Bill gates is smarter than me, hedge funds are greedy, go to the moon while making a difference in the planet.

n2ac90,,wallstreetbets,post,1619840004,"DD My Fat Ex-wife edition - Becky Stocks - Etsy - Down 5% April 30th, not going to stay down.It's  afterhours Friday April 30th and the market just took a bit of a dump.  Nothing to panic over but a solidly red day following an all time high.  Previously I have focused by DD efforts into research on Boomer Stocks.   Great stocks with real products, strong histories of growth, objectively clear market conditions (e.g. steel is up bigly US Steel will likely have a great Q2)

This week I need to focus on the other side of my portfolio - Becky Stocks.   My fat ex-wife always makes me add some Becky to our portfolio so I looked into the Becky index and found ETSY.  It looked like a solid option at first with earnings still approaching and other similar stocks gaining post earnings (Amazon, Shopify), but then to top it off it dumped 5% today.  A $25 billion dollar company lost over a $1 billion in value in a single day.  Not because of any particular negative news or anything, it appears to just be a general sell-off.

**Does Becky still like Etsy? - Yes**

Etsy has grown revenue and profits by margins ranging from 100 to 500% YoY growth in all the key financial metrics.  Etsy is more popular than ever and Google Trends data/Alexa rankings don't show a noteworthy slowdown.  ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh\_&geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F0byvh_&geo=US))

**Does Becky have incentive to buy cute Etsy items as things slowly open up? - Yes**

Responsible Becky hasn't had the ability to host house parties or show off newest 'Live, Laugh, Love' decor.  Everyone wants to get out and see friends/family and Becky knows that theme parties and custom theme'd decor is he best way to prepare for these parties.   Just as a general rule there is suddenly a lot more incentive to make your house more guest friendly moving forward.  

**Was Etsy just over-valued and dumping?**  

While the P/E for Etsy is high at 76 that is comparable to Amazon (who is going to rate lower partially because they just had great earnings while Etsy hasn't reported yet to clear out Q1 2020 from it's ratings) and less than companies like Square and Shopify.  Obviously growth is assumed, but Etsy clearly has room to grow so it should not be a problem.  Etsy is currently trading almost $50 below it ATH from March 1st and while having wild swings over the past months it has been generally stable as a stock and there isn't any reason to suspect another major shift downward.

**TL D/R What does it all Mean?**

Etsy is a solid growth stock that appears to be at or near bottom with an earnings report coming up that will likely be favorable.  Other companies in online retail have seen boosts from good earnings so why not Etsy?  

&#x200B;

**Boomer Thoughts**

Etsy may be 'Tech' but it is harnessing the ingenuity of the American people to create new and unique products.  They have already shown that they have strong management by using their early pandemic mask sales jump to gain, retain, and boost their customer base.   Hard workers making physical goods with solid leadership makes for a good company.  They don't have a dividend yet but they are new and need to reinvest in the company.  Considering their primarily female audience making efforts to reach out to men would be a great next step.  Improving the search function could certainly help.

**Fat Ex-Wife Thoughts**

There is no way Etsy is going to stay down this low.  Everyone I know is using Etsy for personal products and gifts.  Amazon is great for generic products but it has become absolute trash when you want to find something meaningful due to the way generic products flood the market for just about anything you want.  Etsy makes online shopping fun again while Amazon shopping is about as fun as running any errand.  It is going back up to its 250 ATH and beyond.   Just hold on for a while!  My Ex-husband wants to buy US steel instead.  They already had earnings and already went up.  He has all quarter to rotate what's left of his losses into X.  I want my part of the portfolio in something happy!

**Positions**

None, plan to buy calls for the end of May either ITM or slightly OTM Monday

[FSD from Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/cvpxp3mgrhw61.png?width=1746&format=png&auto=webp&s=27d959d4fd9ffe476e5283c255656645038cd96d)

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into perception-planning-control blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD.  Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.  

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 10s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + hd maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach. 

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about perception part.  So as I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years. 
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate. 
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago. Check this video from Waymo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYwS-gtAJMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYwS-gtAJMo)
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

&#x200B;

[LiDAR in rain](https://preview.redd.it/a6b6z03srhw61.png?width=1726&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c2a499b5dad20cfa1cb2e2d179ad58846c9904)

Alright, suppose Tesla solved this perception problem successfully using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next?  We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the actually hardest part.  What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents:  the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even it look more ""amazing"":

The hard problem lies in busy, urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive?  How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc, but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties which may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015 ish, and it is an area that Tesla barely touches today.  See this video of a Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk&t=28s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk&t=28s)

It still struggles to get out elegantly (thought it is pretty safe).  There is also a recent video on FSD in SF:

[https://youtu.be/NfikK9aWrlE?t=556](https://youtu.be/NfikK9aWrlE?t=556)

[\\""Nightmare\\"" for self driving cars](https://preview.redd.it/1jjpgjdjshw61.png?width=1713&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3c289e2d3155f35aedcf6ea3eb8257648bb162)

It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05449.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.05449.pdf)

Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.  

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long:  Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  And Tesla is not even reporting disengagement data for now. However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales pov). 

TLDR:  Robo-taxis is far, self driving is fun :)","['MPC', 'TSLA', 'HD', 'RL']"

This stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. 



2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.



3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.



4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.



5. Options IV is a complete joke right now and a great opportunity to get in.

The company who will sell you everything except freedom and independence. $BABA-BooeySo y'all have been asking for an  easy, can't-possibly-fuck-it-up type of trade, especially after the  $ISRG debacle.  I don't usually like writing up about companies with  more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception  just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade,  especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than  trying to piss them off.  So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA)

# Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock

$BABA  is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL,  and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China).  Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?).

Anecdotally,  they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4  drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs).

&#x200B;

# Peering over the Great Wall:

&#x200B;

Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of ""taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site"" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (**DUMB FILTER ALERT:**  automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem  (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last  year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting  him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there.

Interestingly,  as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership  over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns  1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade  in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off,  in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while  waiting to see what China was going to do with them.  Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking).

As  a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a  unique animal on Wall Street:  An ultra cap growth stock that is also  technically a value stock.  Just don't tell them they're a unique animal  or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill  everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make  their dicks bigger.  I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.  In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3  times that.

&#x200B;

# So what's their problem?

&#x200B;

 

I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company ""Same Ole Shit"" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now.

# So how does the Tendieman come?

Expected  47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022.  Also,  now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again,  as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to  the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd  party network while bolstering $BABA's own.  Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well.

But  there's a catch:  Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a  few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to  finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into  the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they  report their next earnings late May.   Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.

&#x200B;

#  Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis)

So  this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put  up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced  concepts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz1r53hj9bw61.jpg?width=1388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=631e23902505c2d7cf90f7e03e806067307c08f1

As  always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan  is a 20 day EMA.  Red lines represent the wedge that's important for  all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a  breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some  channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a  bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use  those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and  another time.  I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of  America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit.  So  consider this a level up.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Look in the red wedge.  We're  coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the  time they report earnings.  Look at all the other pretty colors and see  if a wrinkle doesn't develop.

One other thing we can look at is price to fair value.  This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/igrlkysl9bw61.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3350b76b9dbc752c0f24d6e410df5f14291dab98

&#x200B;

So there are a couple of things I  want to call out here.  One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is  wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric.  The other one  is a term that I want you guys to start learning called ***""Economic Moat""***.   The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to  lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure  that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what.  Wide moats  are good but rather rare.  Obviously, if you read the ""who are these  people"" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any  company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of  entry to challenge them is enormous.  Just ask their main competition,  $JD, who takes 1 step forward and 8 steps back every time they try.

# So, to summarize:

* Absolute  monster of a company 20% off its highs because of a combination of  government interference, continued concern over regulatory fuckery, and  the fact that nobody trusts the books of a Chinese company
* Over 90% of their market is penetrated, and they have aggressive expansion plans abroad
* Presently at a value level ***today*** as a result of them still being fairly fresh out of their hand slap for the shit they pulled
* I expect some DJI drones sent to my PO box after you make tendies on this
* Reports  late May; is very much a 2nd half of the year play - don't expect a ton  of movement in May up until earnings.  But volatility is already low.

# Price Targets:

For  once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there.  This  company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd  half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that.

&#x200B;

#  How do you play it?

**LEAPS ONLY!**  If you look at the daily chart, it had a bit of a pop after they got  fined, but has been largely flat money lately as nobody has wanted to  exit out of their positions due to it being undervalued, but not a lot  of demand to get IN to the position due to the overall market conditions  as a whole.  July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay  the extra premium.  If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a  peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270,  $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from  one another starting in August and running through November, along with  some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it.

Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price.

One  thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the  companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have  enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would  abandon one play for another.  I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.   Semis in June would be a personal choice.  I'd bail on the Devil's Gold  companies I talk about, I'd bail  on $BB, and the other trades are kind  of dead, anyways.

&#x200B;

#  Position Disclaimers:

Some  of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio  for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in  preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions  and timing.  $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs  on.  Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.  I also have a significant amount of  shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are  sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade.

There you have it, kids.  Go forth, and tendie-ize.

All my love

\-Chad Dickens

n1so1m,,wallstreetbets,post,1619785288,"Quick TA DD on CLOV as of 4/29/21Hello my fellow apes, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I have decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action for CLOV.

As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:

* The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 were all up by EOD.
* MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD.

&#x200B;

[Daily chart of CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/byclt37gzaw61.png?width=3766&format=png&auto=webp&s=156907323ac0c10051c6051276d9d110e5c4640c)

**Fibonacci retracements:**

Looking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session (4/30/21) as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34.

If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.

&#x200B;

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more.

With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon.

As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.

&#x200B;

**Other:**

* Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment.
* RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI.
* Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase.
* Triple bottom and we've bounced off every single time, another bullish sentiment.
* All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap.

**Conclusion:**

All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.

**Tl;dr: We are going to the fucking moon, don't be scared of the setbacks and don't panic sell.**

P.S. Please let me know if you guys liked my TA and I might regularly post a TA DD on this sub!

* Look at all the key factors posted in the picture, compared to INTC and NVDA
* Long term debt is non existant (compared to sky high debt of INTC)
* EPS has been + since 2017 and rising incredibly fast last 6months
* When short interest stays high, the SP plateaus (also the case in the last half year). When a short squeeze happens this of course brakes the pattern.
* PE ratio has cratered, this is a serious thing (NVDA is over double AMD for the moment)
* Revenue is increasing at serious speeds.
* Data centre share is being stolen from INTC
* Some major investors are playing Q's and keep the price down, why? Making calls obsolete?

Sell 300 $28 calls and buy 150 $29 calls. This will turn your long $25 strike calls into $3 long call spreads, while adding $1 short call spreads above it, creating a butterfly spread. This will claw back premium and if by some chance the stock takes off, it's still profitable, with max profit at the $25 strike.

Edit: I wasn't looking at the option chain when I wrote this out, so the strikes available may be different.  This is just an example of how to create a butterfly spread when you already have existing long calls. You can adjust the wings however you want by adjusting the strikes, though you should keep the short wing smaller than the long so you're covered if the price runs.",

For the unaware, EDR (Endeavor Holdings) just got a majority stake in the UFC yesterday. This is the first time the UFC is being publicly traded. This is a ridiculous opportunity because the UFC is still relatively new. 

MMA was the only sport that ran flawlessly throughout the pandemic, and the ufc is already selling out stadiums at full capacity as of last weekend for UFC 261. Every year they break their previous records for PPV buys, and that trend will continue as the UFC continues to expand internationally. Dana White has gone on record stating that the UFC will set up a card in Africa in 2022 to try drawing talent from that area. Imagine more Ngannous and Kamaru Usmans!!!

Oh... and Elon Musk has the midas touch, so having him on the board is sure to boost value just by his presence alone.

Royalties this year are expected to be $3.3 million for 2021 (virtually double the 2020 royalties) thanks to the $22 billion contract between Microsoft and the US army. S2upid smashed up a Hololens to prove MVIS tech was in it and MVIS confirmed it was their part in S2upids video during their meeting May 2020.

We also now have back on the table the rumoured $100million deal with Sharp who have just had a 12 month extension granted to their exclusivity deal for MVIS tech for a display/smart speaker etc.

We then have the value of 484 patents as of last year, which has no doubt increased in number since then.

We also have the disruptive best in class A sample LIDAR produced this month, which beats anything from  anyone else hands down.  A bidding war feels imminent on this, unless a deal has already been agreed privately subject to maybe one more milestone of them testing it themselves first...

And then add on the other products that they are working on. 

I’m amazed this hasn’t gone higher in share price! It definitely feels like it will be a 3 figure stock for the buy out.

**A 100% Cloud-Based SaaS Platform, And The Future Of Supply Chain Management**

With the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain, and recent events such as the Suez Canal blockage, as well as the Semiconductor Shortage, there has never been a stronger demand for Supply Chain efficiency. President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US’’ need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play.

**COMPANY SUMMARY**

*“Leaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.”  \~ Tom Peters*

Essentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%).

ETWO has only recently went public on February 21’, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it’s founders. According to Wikipedia, *the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba.* This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it’s fundamentals and it’s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive).

* *A Snapshot of its largest customer base:*

**Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors:**

* Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications
* integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain
* First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization
* Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base
* Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space
* Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software
* Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model

**Key issues for current supply chains and how $ETWO is solving them:**

**VALUATION**

The stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it’s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it’s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it’s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it’s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis. They also boast an extremely low churn rate, which is a great indicator for SaaS platforms. This is further indication that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals demonstrating the value of ETWO:

**What Wallstreet is Saying**

*“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.  If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.”  \~ Warren Buffett,*

Although it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company:

*""E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.""*

**One Final and Intriguing Note:**

A few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it’s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post).

Short Interest:

[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&f=sh\_opt\_option,sh\_short\_high&o=shortinterestshare&t=ETWO](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&f=sh_opt_option,sh_short_high&o=shortinterestshare&t=ETWO)

I am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light.

Put/Call Ratio:

Anyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl\_cc\_neuberger\_principal\_holdings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/kzmar3/pcpl_cc_neuberger_principal_holdings/)

**TL;DR:**

The cheaply valued ETWO and it’s value proposition, it’s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it’s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry.

*Disclosure: This is by no means financial advice. I just like the stock. I also must disclose that I have both shares and December call options for $ETWO. I am an individual investor, with no association whatsoever with the company.*","['MSFT', 'NKE', 'INTC', 'NVDA', 'AMD', 'FB', 'IBM']"

This company called vaxart (VXRT) is a company based in the Bay Area who focuses on oral recombinant vaccines, such as influenza, norovirus, hpv, and most importantly at this time, coronavirus. 

The crazy thing is that not many people care to understand science, but if you read the presentation from 3/25/2021, it may help profusely:  https://investors.vaxart.com/static-files/560116e8-db25-42df-865e-0ed57b8d129a

The company released an 8k on February 3rd, 2021, which highlights the Janssen collaboration agreement. This collab agreement let's Janssen (owned by JnJ) use their influenza antigen and put it in vaxart pill. The final sentence reads, ""Upon delivery of the report, Janssen has a three-month option to negotiate an exclusive worldwide license to the Company’s technology encompassing the Janssen antigens. Janssen has not notified the Company whether it will exercise this option."" 3 months is 90 days. 90 days from Feb 3 is May 4th (https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-enters-research-collaboration-janssen-evaluate-oral)

The pill was put the test against the leading injectable for the flu, sanofis fluzone . Studies showed that even though Sanofis Fluzone had 10x more antibodies, Vaxarts/Janssens flu pill worked 8% better at preventing influenza because of the heavy amount of T-cells and activating mucosal membranes. Oh yeah, this was funded by BARDA also, so the government knows all about them. 
https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/results-influenza-challenge-study-published-lancet-infectious

Back to may 3rd...vaxart last week announced that they are having a Stanford University T-cell expert to discuss cross-protection against variants. https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-webinar-importance-t-cell

The NEXT DAY, may 4th, Vaxarts Chief Scientific Officer, Sean Tucker, Ph.D., will present at the upcoming World Vaccine Congress Washington that will be held virtually from May 4-6, 2021. The World Vaccine Congress is the largest, most established meeting dedicated to vaccines. From basic research to commercial manufacture, this one meeting covers the whole vaccine value chain where science, government and manufacturers all come together to create groundbreaking progress. Here is a link of speakers : https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/world-vaccine-congress-washington/speakers.stm

These room temperature stable tablets can be shipped overseas to India and Brazil, and all other spots of the world cheaper, easier, without vaccination sites, without fear of needles, (which accounts for 18% of the population of the US alone.), which enables cross variant protection while activating musocal immunity.

Another benefit is they are environmentally friendly. No need for disposal of hundreds of million plastic syringes. 

There is much more Due diligence you could find, such as googling ""richetti brothers vaxart"", ""lodi&the world s2e1"" <<<< Atwill claiming 1 billion pills by years end, and much much more, but that's enough for now. 

Another important note is that on February 3rd, 2021, vaxart dropped 60% and continued to fall from 25 to 5. This was due to investors knowing about money, not the science. Once they realize they can't compare MRNA technology to their VAAST technology, this thing will BLOW. Example: the influenza studies.

Side note: HUGE MISCONCEPTION. MERCK, PFIZER(pill), RIDGEBACK, REMDESIRIVIR, all those are THERAPEUTICS AND ANTIVIRALS. THEY WORK SYSTEMICALLY. THIS IS A VACCINE. A PREVENTION FROM THE VIRUS ENTERING YOUR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

Side note 2: their building is connected to Janssen with a skybridge. Literally. AND they've increased their employee headcount by 500% in a year with 34 pending positions on LinkedIn. Once those positions are filled, 825% increase in employees. Since may 2020. https://gyazo.com/0691603a06d2a651847b7751af9bc9ab

n1m1xb,,wallstreetbets,post,1619756062,"Aurora Cannabis: Unusual Options Activity ACB $9c 05/21 🚀 🌙Gather around my fellow degens. Breaking news from the potheads at Barcharts.

Aurora Cannabis (ACB) has had an influx of calls in the past two days. Yesterday, they were for calls dated after earnings comes out. Today, there were 2,975 contracts of $9c traded which are set to expire on 05/21. This represents $190,000-210,000 of activity in one trading day buy-side in this one specific option. I’m personally in the $12 call option for 05/21, but that’s because I’m retarded and love to go out of the money.

Earnings for Aurora Cannabis are set to be reported after-hours on 05/13. The underlying stock was sitting at $7.65, a one-month low on the holiday of 04/20 (oh the irony). Since 04/20, the stock has been making its way upward, sitting right below the $9 level of resistance. I expect Aurora Cannabis (ACB) to jump over the $9 mark tomorrow, on April 30, 2021. 

I will be loading up on even more out of the money call options which are set to expire close to the earnings report. I expect the next two trading weeks to be extremely volatile, with an upward trend which peaks within a day or two of the earnings report. Once we hit earnings, the stock is likely going to come crashing back down to a normal $8-10 range. Don’t be shocked if you see it breaking $15 for a short period of time on the earnings report release week.

TL;DR Buy ACB, smoke free weed.",
n1m1xb,gwdye5n,wallstreetbets,comment,1619756177,As someone who activly watchs ACB it does this every few weeks tbh. Ive seen it fluctuate between 8-10 for a while every once in a while breaking out in 11.,
