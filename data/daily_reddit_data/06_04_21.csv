**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

When I called the broker, they put in a market sell order and told me my confirmation would be sent to my email later. 

They sold my shares for $62.58/share

Brk.b traded today at $260-263.35

Does anyone know how this is even possible? I understand market orders won’t exercise at the exact price, but a 76% loss, is absolutely crazy. 

Is there no sort of protection against this kind of thing? How does this even happen? 

The broker is closed now for the evening, but will be calling first thing in the morning. 

Looking for some helpful information or thing I can reference when I call in the morning at open.






EDIT UPDATE:

Called them this morning. They didn’t even answer the phone during their posted business hours. Just adds the the amazing service this company provides. 

After calling the number for the old platform holders, and nearly 25mins on hold, they found a person for me to speak with.

I described the problem and the representative n the phone seemed like this was normal at first. She then had a light bulb go off and remembered they had an internal email she quickly glossed over that discussed this issue. She asked me to hold so she could review it again. 

Apparently there was an error on the new platform that didn’t perform the sell orders correctly. They were suppose to sell at $262.276.

I asked when, if, they would be correcting this and if they planned to notify the customers. They said that they were in the process of correcting the error but never notified the customers of the issue(wonderful, thanks). 

I guess it also takes 10 days after the sell date, to receive my money. Also, she confirmed they still don’t sell fractional shares. 

I plan to no longer use them, but leave the remaining 1.5 shares or so that’s left in there, forever.

It’s Global Shares Equity

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities rallied Monday with S&P 500 and Dow both setting new record closes. Growth outperformed value, though both factors saw good gains. Consumer discretionary was the leader with travel and leisure names faring well. Communications services performed well with FB and GOOGL strength. Tech was boosted by AAPL and MSFT. Energy was the only sector lower on the day. Treasuries were mostly firmer led by the five year point of the curve after rates saw some upward pressure on Good Friday when equities were closed. 10s finished above 1.70% again. Dollar weakened vs both yen and euro. Gold finished fractionally higher. WTI crude ended down 4.6%.
   * **Market was largely supported by combination of upbeat recovery sentiment following better March employment data and fairly well behaved bond yields**. Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K, well above the 660K consensus, while net upward revisions to prior months totaled 156K. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation, the room for further recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic and the lack of upward pressure on wages. Fits with broader reopening momentum seen in high-frequency indicators surrounding mobility, card spending, air travel and dining out.
   * **ISM services hit record high** in March. **Biden said not worried about a tax increase hurting economy** amid heightened debate about how to best fund infrastructure stimulus. **Manchin reiterated corporate tax rate should settle at 25%**, **not 28%**, and more money should come from high earners. **Yellen said US working with G20 on global minimum tax**. Also called on other nations to avoid pre-emptive fiscal tightening. **US vaccine outperformance continues** with seven-day average of 3M+ doses per day, seemingly overshadowing some concerns about a **potential fourth wave**. Multiple reports discussed **dampened momentum behind retail investors**.
   * **GOOGL** secured favorable ruling from SCOTUS in Android copyright infringement case. **TSLA** Q1 deliveries hit a new record high and beat consensus expectations. **PLTR** boosted by \~$90M NNSW contract. **PINS** has reportedly held talks to acquire photography app VSCO. **PXD** to acquire DoublePoint Energy in a cash and stock deal with an EV of $6.4B. **DAL** forced to cancel \~100 flights due to a staffing shortage. **GME** announced 3.5M share secondary offering. **NVTA** higher on Softbank-led investment. **TPCO** board blessed higher takeover bid. **BVH** announced intent to acquire the 7% of **BXG** it does not already own. **LEAF** to be acquired by **GHC** for $323M in cash.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Most sectors finished higher, with growth groups outperforming:**
      * **Consumer discretionary** led the market with strength from AMZN, auto names, and travel/leisure names (NCLH submitted plans to CDC for cruise resumptions). The megacap internets were stronger in **communication services**. MSFT and AAPL helped boost **tech**, with the semi space mostly higher as well. **Consumer staples** were a touch behind on food losses though good gains among drug stores, grocers, and beverages. **Industrials** trailed a bit though transports, A&D, and multis performed well. **Materials** **lagged somewhat with packaging performing well while precious metal miners lagged. Financials** lagged with banks mixed and tech lending lower. **Healthcare** was a relative underperformer. MedTech stocks were generally better but there was some scattered weakness in biotech and pharma. **Energy** was the only sector lower, with E&Ps and oil-services firms weaker alongside crude oil.
   * **Big beat for March payrolls:**
      * Nonfarm payrolls surged 916K in March, the biggest gain since last August and well above the 660K consensus. In addition, the net upward revision to prior months totaled 156K. The unemployment rate fell by 0.2pp to 6.0%, in line with expectations. Household employment increased 609K, the participation rate rose 0.1pp to 61.5% and the employment-population ratio increased 0.2pp to 57.8%. Average hourly earnings fell 0.1% m/m vs expectations for a 0.1% gain, with compositional changes flagged as an overhang. Economist takeaways were positive, highlighting the broad-based job creation (Goldman Sachs said industry breadth hit a 9-month high) and the further room for recovery over the next few months in the industries most adversely impacted by the pandemic. There was some discussion about a return to the pre-pandemic level of jobs by year-end.
   * **ISM non-manufacturing index posted record high:**
      * **ISM non-manufacturing index** for March soared to 63.7, beating 58.5 estimate and up from prior month 55.3. Highest reading in series history (from 1997). Business activity index up 13.9 at 69.4, new orders index up 15.3 at 67.2, employment index up 4.5 at 57.2. Prices index rose 2.2 to 74. Respondents noted lifting of Covid restrictions has unleashed pent-up demand while capacity constraints remain a challenge. Elsewhere, March **Markit services PMI** at 60.4, up 0.4% from flash; above Feb's 59.8. Highest since Jul-14. New orders, input, output cost series up sharply.

mkszp8,,stocks,post,1617651612,"Dow, S&P 500 rally to records, boosted by strong economic data 

NEW YORK  (Reuters) -     U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, as a round of strong  economic data on the labor market and services sector buoyed investor  optimism for the economic reopening and a muted climb in the 10-year  U.S. Treasury yield kept inflation worries at bay.

An ISM survey for March showed a measure of U.S. services industry  activity jumped to a record high. The data followed Friday's report  showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs in March, trouncing  forecasts.  

Investors have bet on sectors poised to lead an economic reopening,  such as energy, financials and materials. A climbing yield on the  10-year U.S. Treasury note has dented appetite for technology stocks. 

Despite strong economic data, gains were led by sectors that have  underperformed recently, including communication services, consumer  discretionary and tech, as the 10-year yield remained below a 14-month  high hit last week.  

""One of the fears in March was that the rise in rates meant you need to take multiples down,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 

""It's not the reopening trade at this point, it is higher interest  rates are here but not accelerating so the whole economy is being  lifted."" 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 385.96 points, or 1.16%, to  33,539.17, the S&P 500 gained 59.11 points, or 1.47%, to 4,078.98  and the Nasdaq Composite added 234.78 points, or 1.74%, to 13,714.89.

With speedy vaccinations and additional government stimulus helping  the S&P 500 and the Dow clinch all-time highs, focus now turns to  progress on a massive infrastructure plan and the upcoming corporate  earnings season.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still about 4% below its February high as  the recent spike in bond yields spurred inflation concerns and made  growth stocks less attractive.

Energy shares were the worst performing sector, following a sharp  drop in oil prices. Reopening plays gained, as the S&P 1500 airlines  index jumped 3.43% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk."" The  agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all  non-essential trips.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she was  working with G20 countries to agree on a global corporate minimum tax  rate to end a ""30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.""","['SPGI', 'NDAQ', 'DOW']"

So to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever
Here's why I like these in short

So I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but also this is a diversified business and it's growing YoY.
Google and Facebook are one of the best in the world the advertising business is growing strong every year and there's no sign this will stop also they are entering other industrys
With Amazon it's another beast who's entering other industries all the time there cloud computing is growing strong and there advertising business are also growing.
With Unilever I like this because over 2 billion people use their products every day and it's growing in emarging markets.


I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.

Here's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them
So with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the ""lost decade"" he averaged 14% return every year.
He also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.
With the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.
Finally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure

Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations

* I *was* and *am* still super long on BABA. I don't see how this stock is not 300+. What I didn't *appreciate* properly was that the FUD surrounding BABA would far outweigh the fundamentals at least in the ""short term"" and not the other way around. I thought BABA found support after the initial drop from 320 to 250 in a 2 weeks timespan. Boy was I wrong. The FUD was just beginning and it's still going on. I went from +25% unrealized to -90% realized.

ml50d6,gtjn24v,stocks,comment,1617693146,"Real gdp growth is not something that is higher or lower than reported, only NGDP can be revised based upon RGDP number. RGDP is real output = income in an economy, so she's right that tech is hugely deflationary and has probably been the main driver that's pushed interest rates to low levels.

Inflation, on the other hand, can be fully determined by monetary policy absent supply shocks. Notice how we've not had significant supply shocks since the oil shocks, mainly because technology has improved our supply chains so that thing don't get bottlenecked anymore. This implies that inflation is neither determined by growth nor by technology, but by the Fed. If they see signs that NGDP picks up higher than RGDP for extended time (nominal income outpaces real income, or more money chasing goods not being produced with fast enough technological progress) then they tighten policy and vice versa. The nature of the technology, whether it's textile mills or supercomputers, is irrelevant.

Inflation numbers, whether you look at PPI or CPI or PCE or the GDP deflator or independent measures like billion prices project, all fall roughly in line, suggesting there's no systematic, artificial revision upwards or downwards.

mk9aak,,stocks,post,1617584936,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 yearsThe U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.""We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) can be an income machine for stimulus check recipients.

For example, the rollout of 5G networks should be a significant positive for AT&T. It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.


AT&T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months. This may have to do with subsidiary WarnerMedia releasing all of its movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they'll hit theaters.","['CMCSA', 'AMP']"

Look at the market before the crash in ‘08 and look at it now. The people who sold during the crash locked in losses.

problem with anything ""green"" or ""sustainability"" right now is that those ivestment opportunities that claim to be green / sustainable etc actually are not. once you look deeper you find plenty of traditional companies in them, especially in the energy sector.   
only because BP / Shell  etc invested heavily in green energy as well, it does not make them green at all.

mks6av,gthwlqm,stocks,comment,1617656767,"This company is still 75% owned by a private equity group. The balance sheet is quite leveraged and that is before the $1 billion of long term lease obligations. Do not ignore lease obligations when evaluating balance sheet risk for a retail chain. This is not to say it is dangerously leveraged.

It was taken private for $4.6 billion in 2015 and is currently worth $8.5 billion (before leases which are not usually counted in enterprise value). Personally, I think 14x EBITDA is a bit steep  for this company. FCF generation is also on the very low end for a mature retailer at 2% (FCF/revenues). HD is double that, for comparison, and pays a dividend and has none of the balance sheet risk for only slightly slower growth and a 16x EBITDA multiple.

I think WOOF is a much better risk/reward 20% cheaper from $21, \~$16-17.

ml1uvi,gtjgc27,stocks,comment,1617687180,"I can see the rationale behind the growth patterns.

Those with the highest influence on the profit margins will grow faster than those without.  This may be due to customers having a hands-on feel for the product, visual cues, as well as easier to market and develop from an end-user's perspective (you already know what they are going to do, so can tailor it exclusively towards that).

DevOps, CDN, and Cybersecurity are all expenses with no direct relation to the profitability of a company.  DevOps and CDN help development, but unfortunately the customers who do buy these tend to be more business oriented and think ""they are developers, they should be doing this anyways.  We don't need this since this doesn't drive profits.  Make dev work easier?  What do I pay you for?""  And cybersecurity is similar however it only crops up when breaches happen and people hear about it.  If no one hears about it, then did a breach really happen?  So most try to find the solution that is ""just good enough"" without hurting their bottom line.

Marketplace is the outlier here, as it's neither a cost or profit driven motive.  It's like an eBay of sorts, but it also depends on how it's monetized and utilized by it's users.  More users = more traffic.  More monetization can lead to higher profits and/or less users.  So like Social Networks, it needs to build a user base before it can monetize.  However it has additional leg work to do depending on what type of goods it's attempting to sell and the Marketplace not being user driven (compared to Social Networks).","['LEG', 'EBAY']"

mki9or,,stocks,post,1617621456,"Janet Yellen to call for global minimum tax rateJanet Yellen will use her first major address as Treasury secretary to argue for a global minimum corporate tax rate, Axios has learned, as she makes the case for President Biden’s plan to raise U.S. corporate taxes to fund his $2 trillion+ infrastructure plan.

Why it matters: Convincing other countries to impose a global minimum tax would reduce the likelihood of companies relocating offshore, as Biden seeks to increase the corporate rate from 21% to 28%.

“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” Yellen will say today in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to an excerpt of her prepared remarks obtained by Axios.
""It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.""
""We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom.""
The big picture: President Trump lowered the U.S. rate from 35% to 21%, arguing that U.S. companies were at a global disadvantage and were being incentivized to relocate offshore.

The average corporate rate in the G7 is 24%, with some nine countries recently lowering their corporate rate, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative tax group.
Biden’s plan would also raise the international minimum rate for foreign profits from U.S. companies from 10.5% to 21%, which would still be lower than the 28% domestic corporate rate.
Driving the news: Biden has tapped five Cabinet secretaries to explain — and sell — his plan to the American public, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

Yellen’s task is to make the international case. Her speech also is designed to set the tone for the annual spring International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, which will begin virtually this week.
Between the lines: Biden has been relying on Yellen to convince the business community and reassure Wall Street that his $2 trillion+ infrastructure proposal, on top of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package, won’t lead to inflation.

Now he’s deploying her to convince international finance ministers and central bankers that the world’s biggest economies need to act in concert on corporate rates to avoid a race to the bottom.
Go deeper: Yellen will also challenge the world’s economic powers to focus on climate change and on ways to improve vaccine access for the world’s poorest countries.

She will call for $650 billion in new “Special Drawing Rights” — essentially lines of credit at the IMF that can help developing countries access more U.S. dollars.
The Trump administration was skeptical of new SDR allocations and many congressional Republicans are still opposed.
The bottom line: By trying to convince other countries to impose a global minimum tax, Yellen is acknowledging the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.

“Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,” she will say.

Their most recent 3 billion dollar offering triggered the majority of events that lead to its slide. A large hedge fund was way over leveraged and betting on Viacom when analysts downgraded it and the offering news came the stock slid which triggered margin calls for the hedge fund and forced the liquidation of hundreds of millions of shares. If you look at the 1Y chart on Viacom you can see it made an outrageous run. 

In regards to future outlook, they are considered to be behind in the streaming game and are definitely still piecing together their vision while other streaming giants are already off the runway.

The multiple X is a number chosen based on looking at competitors or similarly structured companies, preferably in the same industry, the growth rate, and the risk. Fast-growing stocks get better multiples. Safe industries get better multiples.

For example, let’s say Cheese Inc is a service company with expected sales in 2021 of  $15.5B. Services usually gets a year-end sales multiple of around 15.

About $GLSI

&#x200B;

Greenwich LifeSciences (Nasdaq: GLSI) is a public clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of an immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences in patients who have previously undergone surgery, that is developing GP2, a novel peptide immunotherapy, and is planning to commence a Phase III clinical trial ([https://greenwichlifesciences.com](https://greenwichlifesciences.com)).

GP2 is derived from the HER2/neu protein, which is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including breast cancer.  Tumors with elevated expression of HER2/neu protein are highly aggressive, resulting in an increased disease recurrence and a worse prognosis.  In a Phase IIb clinical trial in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting, no breast cancer recurrences were observed after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized.  In addition, GP2 treatment is well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to GP2 immunotherapy were reported.

&#x200B;

Upcoming Potential Catalysts for 2021

April 9-10- Greenwich is to announces more GP2 data on at the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) annual meeting, where the company will release the final 5-year immune response results from its Phase IIb trial ([https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual)).

The AACR plans to publish two Greenwich LifeSciences abstracts on April 9, 2021 at 12:01 am EST and posters on April 10, 2021 on its Phase IIb clinical trial's final five year immune response data and its planned Phase III clinical trial updated design.

Obviously I can’t predict the future, but  I hypothesize- determinate on the outcome of the results- that price action will be fire in the premarket and could start as early as 04:00:01 est. For that reason I am planning to set a GTC, extended hours, limit order the night before (04/08) with a lofty price target as things can get crazy in the premarket with low volume and high volatility. 

Planned Phase III Trial: 9 amino acid HER2/neu peptide + GM-CSF immunotherapy for breast cancer in adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting (postsurgery) in HER2/neu 3+, HLA-A2 patients in Y2 following Herceptin or Kadcyla. 

You can see the clinical trial design here: [https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf](https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf)

Breast Cancer

I’m not going to go into an overview of what breast cancer is, if you want to know more->[https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F). But here are some easily digestible facts to illustrate it’s likelihood, frequency, and most importantly the unmet need for improved treatment

One in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, with approximately 266,000 new breast cancer patients and 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in 2018, all of whom have the potential to experience breast cancer recurrences (Source: American Cancer Society).

HER2/neu 3+ (“HER2-positive”) breast cancer patients comprise approximately 25% of all breast cancer patients (Source: American Society of Clinical Oncology).

For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. In 2021, it's estimated that about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancers.

Breast cancer became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

About 85% of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. These occur due to genetic mutations that happen as a result of the aging process and life in general, rather than inherited mutations.

The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are sex (being a woman) and age (growing older).

This is significant because these are not factors one can necessarily change, as opposed to being able to reduce your risk for lung cancer by not smoking, avoiding radiation, and radon, etc.

&#x200B;

So what does that mean?

$GLSI isn’t trying to replace current therapies, but work in tangent with them and is designed to be compatible with future derivatives:

		“GP2 can be the treatment that will naturally overlap with or follow Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu or any of the other Herceptin derivatives being developed” (pg. 6)

&#x200B;

So the way I see this, GLSI isn’t trying to come into the marketplace as a competitor to the current treatment options available (which would be a much harder pitch to doctors who are currently using Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu) but as a supplementary treatment. 

&#x200B;

“GP2 & GM-CSF starting in Year 2 act synergistically with Herceptin to prevent cancer recurrences, if fully immunized, reducing recurrence rates from 11% to 0% at median 5 years follow-up (p = 0.0338), with minimal to no side effects & no SAEs.”

“In the initial GP2 indication, approximately 17,000 new patients could be treated per year, saving up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year.” (pg4)

Side note: notice that the quote above didn’t really need to be said; and definitely not included in a presentation of clinical data (presumably every doctor scrutinizing the results can do simple math). As an investor, this is one of the many things that make me very bullish about GLSI. A company could get fantastic clinical results but as the average investor doesn’t know how to interpret the results, if the company doesn’t present them in an easily digestible form, many investors will (rightfully so) pass on trading that position.  And GLSI does that. You don’t even need a GED to open their PR, see “0% recurrence of breast cancer in 96 patients over 5 years” and “results indicate  GP2 could save up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year” to know that is great news and hop in a position trading on that news. More people trading => more volume, and on a low float stock like GLSI (2.69M shares according to yahfin) it will not take much to get the share price moving. If GLSI comes out and shows that the rest of their data is as good as their top-line, it will be a very profitable day for trading. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead of cancer, imagine GLSI was focusing on migraines and their medicine gets FDA approved. Now why would the doctor prescribe GLSI over some other company that he has been prescribing for years and years he knows works fairly well (so harder to get into the marketplace = less sales = less revenue)? Not to mention the doctor’s probably got connections and fiscal incentives already connected to the current treatment options, so again there would be less incentive to prescribe GLSI. 

But what if you went to the doctor’s with a migraine, got treated for your migraine using your doctor’s preferred treatment options (so he’s still happy) and then as a patient was provided with an option to take a booster pill. The doctor tells you, so far about 100 people have taken the booster pill and NONE of them have had ANY migraines in the 5 years since taking it. On top of that, there have been little to NO side effects after taking the booster pill.  So would you take the booster pill to safely and effectively eliminate the possibilities of a migraine every coming back (or at least, for the next 5+ years)?

Now replace migraine with breast cancer, and that booster pill is $GLSI 

&#x200B;

Breast cancer (ALL cancer) is extremely scary, I don’t even pretend to know what kind of impact that diagnosis  can have on one’s life. I am apart of a family who has been horribly affected by cancer and I know we would do anything to prevent having to relive that experience nightmare. And as breast cancer is the number 1 common cancer globally, I know my family is not alone in this feeling of desperation.

Additional Details

4 clinical trials. 138 treated breast cancer patients. ​

No cancer recurrences if fully immunized.  No reported serious adverse events.  Well tolerated safety profile.

Thus far, the safety and efficacy of the GP2 immunotherapy have been tested in four clinical trials, where 138 patients have received treatment to date. The past trials consist of three Phase I clinical trials and one Phase IIb clinical trial. 

In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center (16 sites) Phase IIb clinical trial led by MD Anderson and completed in 2018, no recurrences were observed in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized with GP2 (p = 0.0338). 

Full immunization was received in the Primary Immunization Series (PIS), which included the first 6 GP2 + GM-CSF intradermal injections over the first 6 months.  The PIS elicited a potent immune response as measured by local skin tests and immunological assays.  Further, booster injections given every 6 months prolonged the immune response, thereby providing longer term protection.  In the Phase IIb and three Phase I clinical trials, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the GP2 immunotherapy. 

89 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF, 91 placebo patients treated with GM-CSF

17 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF + trastuzumab

14 patients treated with GP2 + AE37 + GM-CSF

18 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF

Top performing IPO in 2020 ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28)).

On December 8, 2020, GLSI share price closed at $5.20 per share. Then GLSI published its 5-year breast cancer data from a Phase IIb trial on December 9, which showed 0% breast cancer recurrences over 5 years of follow-up. On that day, the company's stock spiked to $158 per share and closed at $57 per share, surging the next day to $128 per share and closing at $72 per share. 

This shows huge (positive) market sentiment towards the data and it is reasonable to assume the market will react similarly on similar news. Perhaps even stronger since this data set will be the complete results. 

The company experienced another spike in share price on March 8, 2021, opening at $23 per share, spiking at $53 per share, before finally closing at $37 per share when it was announced that Dr. Jaye Thompson would be brought on full time to lead the GP2 Phase III trial in the fight against breast cancer. 

A 130% increase in share price just on the news of HIRING someone for phase III shows the market is still very much interested in Greenwich’s GP2 trial.

Greenwich LifeSciences Announces Option Agreement for Pre-clinical Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates

“Snehal Patel, CEO of Greenwich LifeSciences, commented, “While we are focused on the upcoming GP2 Phase III breast cancer clinical trial, and are also exploring how to expand the use of GP2 in additional indications through supplemental clinical trials, we have decided to explore the addition of new immunotherapy product candidates to our pipeline at both the pre-clinical and clinical stages of development. The objective of the coronavirus vaccine program is to leverage the development team’s experience in achieving 100% protection against lethal levels of pneumonic plague infection to increase the percent protection and duration of protection of coronavirus vaccines under development. It is not clear how long one will be protected by the current Covid-19 vaccines and none that have been developed to date offer 100% protection. We are hopeful that our approach, which showed 100% protection against pneumonic plague, may lead to greater and longer lasting protection compared to existing Covid-19 vaccines under development.”” [https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates)

Personally- is this a reason to buy GLSI? No. Is this a reason to hold GLSI? No. Is this bad news for GLSI? Absolutely not. This holds no impact in my position of GLSI. It is definitely bullish news.

 As of December 31st, 2020,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In September 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering and raised $7,250,002 in gross proceeds and $6,207,502 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In December 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering and raised $26,400,000 in gross proceeds and $23,959,000 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Company met and exceeded those predictions thus mitigating any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05 and its ability to satisfy the estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements.

&#x200B;

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $28,660,375.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There’s never anything wrong with securing profits. A low risk strategy would be to secure profits on the run up by selling before the catalyst drops. 

One optimal approach is sell enough shares to cover your cost basis and let your remaining shares ride into the catalyst. 

Curiously, GLSI has waited until circa 1:20 pm est to run on multiple occasions- I can’t even begin to speculate why but unless GLSI hits over $150 in the morning I will most likely be hanging out in the position until at least 2pm est. 

Obviously, I’ll use TA to monitor the situation and will adjust my current strategy depending on new data. 

With such a low float, low volume stock, poised to release such great news, it makes a realistic price target very hard to chart out or even predict with any confidence. If $GLSI can break past resistance in the low 50s, it could easily gap back up over 100 with enough volume. The possibility is there, the likelihood is unknown. 

I will be watching GLSI closely on 04/09, and will use indicators to help navigate the best exit price. Note, on their topline data, RSI went well past 95, so if one sold at 70 there would have been a lot of money left on the table.

Couple final tips to help you determine when to sell:

Don’t be greedy.

No one ever went broke taking profits.

If it’s worth screenshotting, it’s worth selling. 

&#x200B;

Insider Trading

From [https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi](https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi) we can see there were several insider purchases of the stock before the initial topline data was announced and have not see any selling of the stock, even during it’s 3000% run. This makes me very bullish.

Institutional Ownership (cont’d)

All of the highlighted institutions opened positions for the first time in GLSI (17 out of 19). Institutional buy ins from major players like Vanguard, Blackrock, BAC, and Wells Fargo makes me extremely bullish.","['PG', 'PM', 'GM', 'BLK', 'NDAQ', 'BAC', 'WFC', 'IR', 'GPS']"

mldi24,gtkr1dw,stocks,comment,1617721131,"Share price is all determined on the supply & demand of shares for a specific stock.

When something causes demand to increase, such as good news, the share price will increase too. Vice versa, when less traders are interested, demand decreases, share price decreases too.

There are two types of positions in the market - long & short. Long positions are entered by buying stock, whilst short positions are entered by selling stock. If more people want to long instead of short, the price increases. More people want to short than long, price decreases. 

Selling a stock at a high price first is called short-selling; it’s when you expect the stock to go down. But how do you get these shares to sell first, if you don’t own any? In summary, you borrow shares from your broker and sell them on the market. When you want to exit a trade, you buy back those shares. If you sold high and bought low, congrats, you made some profit. Sell low and buy high = loss. 

To earn money in the market, it’s always buy low, sell high (which can be done in any order). You can research more of it 👍",
mldi24,gtksowp,stocks,comment,1617721869,"The whole market is one big auction.  It happens fast with big stocks, but if you look at little stocks with less trading going on, it slows down and you can see it.  You have people willing to buy at a certain price, and people willing to see at a certain price.  For example, you might see:

Last: $3.24
1500  3.24 x 3.26  750

This means there are 1,500 shares bid (willing to buy) at $3.24, and 750 shares asked (willing to sell) at $3.26.  If nobody budges, the share price stays the same.  But, if you enter a market order to buy 200 shares, it’ll hit the “ask” at $3.26.  The ask volume will drop from 750 shares to 550 shares.  The new market will be:

Last: $3.26
1500  3.24 x 3.26  550

...and so on.  That’s a stock sale (or purchase, because every trade is a buy and a sell).  The movement of that auction is what makes stocks go up and down.  Does that make sense?",

##**Engineering & Construction.** 
Analyst Sean Eastman says ""the reinforced focus on infrastructure stimulus and on climate resilience will be powerful multiyear themes.""

1. **AECOM** (NYSE:ACM) can expect a tailwind to its all-organic-growth strategy and ""transportation, environment, and water design/engineering"" represents 65% of revenue.
2. **Quanta Services** (NYSE:PWR) is ""a major enabler of the electrification of the economy, the interconnection of renewable power generation, and the modernization of the electric grid.""
3. **Dycom Industries** (NYSE:DY) is essentially a pureplay on telecom infrastructure specialty contracting and ""should be a beneficiary of rural broadband build-outs.""

##**Machinery & Equipment Rental.** 
Analysts Steve Barger and Ken Newman see ""particular upside potential for our construction machinery OEMs, equipment rental companies, and rail transportation manufacturers.""

1. **Oshkosh** (NYSE:OSK) and **Terex** (NYSE:TEX) are picks with a view that ""new and/or replacement buildings and infrastructure would drive increased utilization for AWPs, telehandlers and scissor lifts, cement mixers, crushing and screening equipment, and potentially fire and emergency trucks.""
2. **Federal Signal** (NYSE:FSS) will benefit from spending on replacement lead pipes and building affordable housing.
3. **Wabtec** (NYSE:WAB) should see business from modernizing public transit and investment in passenger and freight rail.
4. **United Rentals** (NYSE:URI) will get a broad boost from infrastructure spending because of the ""fungibility"" of its fleet.

##**Metals.** 
Analyst Phil Gibbs says the spending program will offer a demand catalyst in the ""intermediate term,"" but the size of the package will likely be closer to $500B to $1T.

1. Along with the broader group, direct beneficiaries with ties the infrastructure or earth-moving equipment will be, in order: **Commercial Metals** (NYSE:CMC), **Nucor** (NYSE:NUE), **Reliance Steel and Aluminum** (NYSE:RS), **Steel Dynamics** (NASDAQ:STLD), **Olympic Steel** (NASDAQ:ZEUS) and **Schnitzer Steel** (NASDAQ:SCHN).

##**Diversified Industrial.** 
Analyst Jeff Hammond thinks the entire group would benefit for fundamental and sentiment reasons.

1. **Colfax** (NYSE:CFX), from welding, **Harsco** (NYSE:HSC), **Eaton** (NYSE:ETN) and **nVent Electric** (NYSE:NVT), both for EV chargers, **Helios Tech** (NASDAQ:HLIO), **Gates Industrial** (NYSE:GTES) should benefit in transportation.
2. **Parker-Hannifin** (NYSE:PH), **ETN**, **NVT**, **Nordson** (NASDAQ:NDSN), **Altra Industrial Motion** (NASDAQ:AIMC), **Rexnord** (NYSE:RXN), **Regal Beloit** (NYSE:RBC), **CFX**, **Enerpac Tool Group** (NYSE:EPAC) will benefit in manufacturing.
3. **Carrier Global** (NYSE:CARR), **Lennox International** (NYSE:LII), **Trane Technologies** (NYSE:TT), **Watsco** (NYSE:WSO), for HVAC, should benefit in housing.
4. **CARR, LII, TT, WSO,** for ventilation upgrades, will benefit in schools spending.
5. **CARR, LII, TT** should benefit from federal building upgrades.
6. **ETN, Generac Holdings** (NYSE:GNRC) should benefit from alternative energy.

##**Auto Suppliers.** 
Analyst James Picariello says the plan is well targeted for the blueprints for mass EV adoption, which are ""strict and consistent emissions regulations, generous consumer tax incentives, and a determinable charging infrastructure buildout.""

1. **Aptiv** (NYSE:APTV) and **BorgWarner** (NYSE:BWA) lead EV supplier opportunities, followed by **Dana** (NYSE:DAN), **Meritor** (NYSE:MTOR), **Magna International** (NYSE:MGA) and **Lear** (NYSE:LEA), but the latter two would be disproportionately hit by higher corporate tax rates.
2. **MTOR** and **DAN** will also benefit from the impact on truck and off-highway markets.

##**Vertical Software.** 
Analyst Jason Celino thinks the plan would ""accelerate digitization opportunities across the architecture and construction industry.""

1. **Bentley Systems** (NASDAQ:BSY) gets 60% of total revenue from infrastructure, so the plan could lead to ""meaningful multiyear tailwinds.""
2. **Autodesk** (NASDAQ:ADSK) exposure to infrastructure of 15-20% of revenue and the ""completion of its Innoyze acquisition, providing solutions for water infrastructure assets, gives us incremental confidence.""
3. **Trimble** (NASDAQ:TRMB) has 25-30% of revenue from infrastructure ""geospatial, construction, and civil engineering offerings are well positioned.""

##**Chemicals.** 
Analyst Aleksey Yefremov highlights benefits for ""industrial coatings, polyurethanes, epoxy, PVC, and chlor-alkali.""

1. **Huntsman** (NYSE:HUN) will see higher end-market demand, with the most upside in polyurethanes.
2. **Olin** (NYSE:OLN) is a pick as the ""proposed spending package laid out plans for manufacturing spend, a key end market for caustic soda. Industrial coatings and adhesives is also a major end market for the Epoxy segment.""
3. **Westlake Chemical** (NYSE:WLK) is ""a beneficiary of strong PVC, building products (mostly pipe), and chlor-alkali markets.""
4. **DuPont** (NYSE:DD) has the most compatible portfolio for the spending bill.
5. **Albemarle** (NYSE:ALB), **Livent** (NYSE:LTHM) should benefit from a pickup in EV support.

##**Communication Services.** 
Analyst Brandon Nispel says the bill ""is positive for infrastructure providers (tower operators) and neutral to negative for network providers (wireless carriers and cable operators).""

1. **American Tower** (NYSE:AMT), **Crown Castle** (NYSE:CCI), **SBA Communications** (NASDAQ:SBAC) are picks in towers, which will be helped by improving investment in wireless networks.
2. **Altice USA** (NYSE:ATUS), **Cable One** (NYSE:CABO), **Charter Communications** (NASDAQ:CHTR), **Comcast** (NASDAQ:CMCSA), **WildOpenWest** (NYSE:WOW) may see a hit to discretionary cash flow due to a higher corporate tax rate.
3. **AT&T** (NYSE:T), **T-Mobile U.S.** (NASDAQ:TMUS) and **Verizon** (NYSE:VZ) are the most at risk of a corporate tax rate hike, with T and VZ seeing incremental taxes of $1.5B to $2B.

##**Entertainment and Video Games.** 
Analyst Tyler Parker says the plan for bringing high-speed broadband to every American will help domestic online vide games

1. **Activision** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts** (NASDAQ:EA), **Take-Two Interactive** (NASDAQ:TTWO) and **Ubisoft** (UBISFY) could see tailwinds.

##**Semiconductors.** 
Analysts John Vinh and Wes Twigg say ""expansion incentives would likely be a tailwind for semiconductor equipment demand while easing the capex burden on manufacturers.""

1. **Applied Materials** (NASDAQ:AMAT), **ASML** (NASDAQ:ASML), **Advanced Energy Industries** (NASDAQ:AEIS), KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), **Lam Research** (NASDAQ:LRCX) and **Teradyne** (NASDAQ:TER) would benefit in equipment names.
2. **Analog Devices** (NASDAQ:ADI), **Intel** (NASDAQ:INTC), **Micron** (NASDAQ:MU), **ON Semiconductor** (NASDAQ:ON) and **Texas Instruments** (NASDAQ:TXN) are picks among those with domestic manufacturing footprints.

##**Utilities.** 
Analyst Sophie Karp notes the majority of the impact on the sector would not come from direct spending, but from fiscal incentives.

1. **American Electric Power** (NASDAQ:AEP), **Southern** (NYSE:SO), **Duke Energy** (NYSE:DUK), **Dominion Energy** (NYSE:D), **Entergy** (NYSE:ETR) and **Edison International** (NYSE:EIX) can benefit from incremental grid investment initiatives and electrifications trends from an EV tide that will ""lift all boats.""
2. **Eversource Energy** (NYSE:ES), **Avangrid** (NYSE:AGR), **Public Service Enterprise Group** (NYSE:PEG), **NextEra Energy** (NYSE:NEE), **Xcel Energy** (NASDAQ:XEL), **AEP**, **Sunrun** (NASDAQ:RUN), **Sunova Energy** (NYSE:NOVA) will be helped by the extension of the investment tax credit and the production tax credit further boosting commercial solar and wind.
3. **Public Service Enterprise Group** (PEG), **Excelon** (NASDAQ:EXC) and **Energy Harbor** (OTCPK:ENGH) would benefit from any concrete federal program to support nuclear energy.

By Tsvetana Paraskova - Apr 05, 2021, 12:00 PM CDT

The United States has made the first step toward harnessing the potential of wave energy, a powerful source of renewable energy which researchers have been studying for decades.   
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued last month a license for what would be the first commercial-scale, utility grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States.
Oregon State University received that license to build and operate the PacWave South testing facility as the industry is developing technology and devices potentially capable of harnessing the power of ocean waves.
Despite decades of studies, wave energy is still little developed—both in the U.S. and elsewhere—because researchers are still looking at ways to reconcile feasibility and costs in a complex marine environment.
In theory, the potential is enormous. In practice, wave energy will need a lot more testing and technology development if it hopes to become a viable renewable energy source.
Nevertheless, a testing facility operational by the middle of this decade could give the impetus the U.S. industry needs to test various technologies for generating electricity from waves and attract investors in the most promising technology. The Biden Administration’s support of renewable energy could also help with industry innovation.
The U.S. is one of the best places in the world for ocean wave energy generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ocean waves have tremendous energy, and the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh). This equals around 64 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, the EIA says.Related: U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb
The potential is there, and it is tremendous. Still, the industry now needs to test and possibly show that wave energy can make a difference with viable solutions in the drive for boosting renewable energy generation.
Oregon State University’s project leaders hope to obtain from FERC construction authorization for the PacWave South testing facility later this spring. Current timelines suggest that construction could begin this summer, and the facility could be operational by 2023, OSU says.
“We know there is still work to do to make this project a reality, but this is a huge moment for this project and for the industry as a whole,” Burke Hales, chief scientist for PacWave, said in a statement.
The World Energy Council estimates that 10 percent of the worldwide electricity demand could be met by harvesting ocean energy, OSU said.
The PacWave test facility could be the companies’ place to showcase technology in order to attract investors in their proposed developments, according to Hales.
“Even somebody like Bill Gates isn’t going to pay somebody millions of dollars to do tests that they think will fail,” Hales told Grist’s Ysabelle Kempe.
Innovation and testing of devices could unlock the tremendous energy potential of ocean waves, which is highest along the Pacific shorelines: California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, according to a recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded by the Department of Energy. The study focuses on the technical resource—the proportion of the theoretical resource that can be captured using existing technology options.
The study found that utilizing just one-tenth of the technically available marine energy resources in the 50 states would equate to 5.7 percent of the current U.S. electricity generation, or enough energy to power 22 million homes. 
DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has identified “energy hotspots” of wave power along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.
“Wave power is a significant, sizeable resource,” marine coastal science advisor Simon Geerlofs says. Yet, he noted that wave energy still has challenges to overcome, including big hurdles like ensuring durability and efficiency of wave energy converters and cost-competitiveness with other energy resources. ",['PM']

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I figured many of you would know the answer to this question. There are two main parts:

&#x200B;

1) As I understand it the basic principle is to execute market orders which will change the price in your favor. This is would be extremely simple, but there is a level of complexity to how this is achieved. I tested this and found that multiple consecutive orders with the same price action need to be registered in order for any useful effect to happen. The best way to describe it is that these consecutive orders accelerate the direction of the price. It would be odd to have this just be a feature of markets, but I can only assume it's other investors creating this effect. Who is sitting there waiting for price action to make a limit order? Is that not literally what market orders are for? Also, why in the world would two market orders in a row make anyone more eager? I am completely confused how this works...

&#x200B;

2)Today I watched what appeared to be the accelerating effect I mentioned above. Both the ask and the bid sides were given forward momentum through market orders. I have never seen anything like this before, but I believe it had something to do with a limit order being spent. The underlying fucking leapt. I felt like I was in a whirlpool. You literally couldn't read any of the limit orders unless you were just focusing on the center. Even then it was anyone's guess what the next one up would be, so.... is this people being speculative, or is this abuse of a fundamental part of the market?",['WHR']

I would recommend you to Google and read up on **programmatic advertising**:  
*The use of automation in buying and selling of digital ad space*

in a very simplified way of explaining the ad tech (programmatic) ecosystem, there are 2 main sides: 1) Buy side 2) Sell side

**1) Buy side**  
Advertisers buy digital ads through **Demand Side Platforms (DSPs)** which represents the brands and marketing agencies that buy advertising inventory to market their products and services.  
Example DSPs: The Trade Desk $TTD

**2) Sell side**  
Publishers sell digital ads through **Sell Side platforms (SSPs)**  which represents the content publishers and app developers that sell that ad inventory to monetize their content and platforms.  
Example SSPs: Magnite $MNGI / Pubmatic $PUBM / Perion Network $PERI

**$MNGI**

MGNI is an industry leader. Magnite recently acquired SpotX which is one of the leading platforms shaping CTV and video advertising globally.  
Together, Magnite and SpotX will create the largest independent CTV and video advertising platform in the programmatic marketplace.  
If you're a long term investor, I would recommend long MGNI.

**$PUBM**

PUBM is the most generic of the various major Sell Side platforms (SSPs), and they are up against bigger & established competitors.  
If you're a short term trader, PUBM seems to have a higher beta (bigger swings) compared to the other adtech stocks.

**$PERI**

PERI has gone under the radar as its growth is slowly but steadily increasing with not much hype around the stock.  
ARK currently holds 1.33% weightage of PERI in their Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL).

**$ROKU**

ROKU is more of a streaming play instead of pure adtech play, but as you mentioned they are trying to build an advertising moat for additional revenue streams.  
ROKU recently acquired Dataxu a demand-side platform (DSP) company that enables marketers to plan and buy video advertising campaigns.  
As an example, advertisers can use Dataxu to buy ads on Roku and retarget consumers on mobile and desktop.",['GOOGL']

This year alone I've done almost $40K in profit, and I've enhanced my technical, fundamental and macro analysis to make decisions on whether to go long/short etc and then initiated vertical spreads from there. (30-45 DTE)

Having said that, I'm thinking about finally creating my own portfolio. I've never done this, despite having a finance background.

My goals are quite simple: 1) Set a sector weight cap limit for each sector, so that if there's a breach, I sell some stock and bring it down. Also setting a ""stock"" weight limit, etc. So I'll be watching those carefully and then I'll know when to take profits or rebalance my positions.

That's the cigar-butt-strategy, that's not a goal. But why the focus on sectors? And why would you sell a company when you made a profit? I mean, if Apple announces new iPhones and iMacs and MacBooks, they report that their sales doubled in the last year, increased their profit margin and the dividend payout, and so on, selling for the sake of rebalancing doesn't sound like the best idea?

&#x200B;

Dividend yield: You should also check the dividend history. Lots of companies don't pay a dividend or pay a smaller amount when they had a bad year. Some don't. And getting dividend when the markets are down to average down is also great...

> This is just a sample portfolio, and I'm going to do more research on  the names... But I'm just wondering is 16 stocks too much for $50K?  Should I increase the Value per stock to $5K instead of $2.5K? 

Well, personally I think 16 is too much, but that also depends on the company. You could buy Apple and probably forget about them for the next 5-10 years. But when you buy AMD now, you maybe have to check what for instance Intel is doing, what CPUs smart phone manufacturers are ordering, and so on.

&#x200B;

Q1) 

Why oil? Oil prices are cyclical and can be very volatile ... and imho clean tech is a better long term investment.

Why four tech companies? Why do you think those four listed will make you more money than for instance Nvidia or Microsoft?

Q2) Well, you don't have to start with 16... If you want to research thoroughly: the annual report of one of my companies is 178 pages long. With \~4 competitors, times 16, that's 14k pages. You know, you can also start with 4 companies and 1/3 of your available money. 

Q3) I wouldn't focus on sectors. I mean, just imagine you picked 10 companies that you like, that are in a really good financial position, growth predictions look wonderful. Now you miss a position in a sector and you have to find a company just for the sake of having a position in that sector. What if you can't find one with the same or better outlook?

What’s the point of shooting for 3-4% in dividends? If you’re from finance them I’m sure you’re aware of the paper “Dividend Policy, Growth, And The Value Of Shares” by Miller and _____(I don’t know how to spell the second guy’s name).

I think you should do a basic index fund portfolio and allocate 20% to be towards individual stocks. For that 20%, invest in what you know and what you deem to be undervalued.

mkn20q,,stocks,post,1617635799,"Reasons to be Bullish about Novavax (NVAX)I have been following NVAX for a while and think that it will be the big winner at the end of all this COVID stuff. I found an excellent writeup/summary which touched all the important points and thought it would be useful here, which I'll summarize below.

[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5edc0eff6a4d6a35f30f4869/t/606805acba16b241de2b06be/1617429937628/NOVAVAX+-+An+Overview.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5edc0eff6a4d6a35f30f4869/t/606805acba16b241de2b06be/1617429937628/NOVAVAX+-+An+Overview.pdf)

**Novavax's vaccine is crazy effective, cheap to make, and easy to transport.**

""The way Novavax’ vaccine works is different even from the ones previously mentioned and approved for use in the United States. NVX-CoV2373 (the formal name for their vaccine) is a protein-based subunit vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. It is adjuvanted 4 with Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-MTM which enhances the immune response and stimulates high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This vaccine candidate does require two doses, spaced three weeks apart. ""

"" Second-generation vaccines, of which Novavax is one, are identified based on their potential to provide protection with a single dose, exhibit stability in greater temperature ranges, remain stable throughout the manufacturing process, yield an improved or differentiated immune response, and use a diverse range of antigens. They are historically cheaper and have had higher levels of efficacy and safety. ""

**They already have over a 200 million orders and they have a worldwide supply chain and distribution already set up.**

""To date, Novavax has increased its projected global manufacturing production rate of NVX-CoV2373 to be over two billion annualized doses when they’re at full capacity, which is expected to occur in mid-2021. Of this anticipated capacity, approximately one billion doses will be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL). Novavax has developed partnerships with entities across the globe to increase its manufacturing capacity and vaccine supplies ""

""Novavax has entered into advanced purchase agreements with various countries globally that, if the vaccine is approved, are expected to result in the delivery of approximately 200 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 throughout 2021 and into the first half of 2022 ""

**It looks like coronavirus is not going away, so people will continue to need boosters and shots to take care of the variant strains.**

""From what I’ve learned about Novavax, they seem to be well-positioned to give COVID-19 the knockout punch. Their underlying recombinant nanoparticle technology has the ability to accurately target viral pathogens and create protein antigens organized around a polysorbate-based nanoparticle core, the assembly of which resembles the native presentation of the pathogen being targeted. This process creates highly-immunogenic, long-lasting, yet safe, vaccines that can tackle not only COVID-19 and its variant strains, but also a wide variety of other disease organisms. One of Novavax’ near-term clinical development work is evaluating the viability of certain combination vaccines, which, if successful, could potentially lead to a seasonal 3-in-1 or 2-in-1 vaccine shot that would take care of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV ""

TLDR: Honestly, no company has the combination of (1) 90%+ efficacy, (2) easy transport and storage, and (3) easy modification like Novavax does. I think this vaccine, along with Pfizer/BioNTech (which I owned last year) will end up the big winner from all this. Moderna is behind Pfizer, AstraZeneca is an absolute mess (the clots appear to be real), and Johnson & Johnson is simply not all that effective.

Price targets on eTrade on average are $323, that's 74% upside. Catalysts coming in April (UK) and May (US). Obviously, all vaccine plays carry risk, but there's no logical reason for the recent downward pressure on NVAX's price. It's part of my well-diversified portfolio.

In super-simplified terms, Xray machines have two key parts: an emitter (which I'll call a light bulb or light tube) and a receiver/detector.

NNOX has apparently only invented a cheaper lightbulb (emitter), not a new detector.  Sounds great, right?  But in reality, the ""light bulb"" component of legacy X Ray machines virtually never fails, and if it does, it's always covered by the seller/leaseholder of the machine for free.  So they're effectively replacing something that nobody who thinks it through will care about.

And supposedly their light bulb is very limited in what parameters it operates, whereas the legacy light bulb sources can be dialled in for all kinds of uses.

If NNOX had invented BOTH a cheaper light tube AND a cheaper detector, then that would be compelling.  But apparently they haven't.

Maybe that take is wrong, and maybe there's some opportunity for slightly lowering the capital cost and the necessary building wiring for a new clinic install.  But it's apparently not as revolutionary as the company promoters make it sound.",['XRAY']

This could mean the difference between paying higher taxes on short-term capital gains (for stocks held less than one year) compared to long-term capital gains (for stocks held longer than one year), for instance.

Most importantly, if you sell any stock at a loss, you can't repurchase it until the 31st day after the sale or else it's considered a wash sale, and the capital loss is disallowed. Selling at a gain and repurchasing immediately isn't a problem.

There's no need to sell everything at once. You could gradually sell positions in RH, wait for the trades to clear, then transfer the cash out and into your new Fidelity account. If you don't care about the tax implications, selling everything and transfer the cash all at once is certainly easier -- just postpone repurchasing any stocks that were sold at a loss until after 30 days.",

mkidra,,stocks,post,1617621851,"CVM (CEL-SCI). Pharma Play for April.**Who:** 

CVM (CEL-SCI)

&nbsp;

**What:**

 CEL-SCI is a biotech company running a Phase III clinical trial with its flagship compound, Multikine.  Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) is an investigational immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a potential treatment for head and neck cancer, and cervical dysplasia or perianal warts in HIV / HPV co-infected patients. If it were to be approved for use following completion of our clinical development program, Multikine could be part of the next generation of cancer immunotherapy because:
•	It is being developed as an off-the-shelf investigational therapy making large scale manufacturing at a reasonable cost possible.
•	It is being developed with both active and passive immunity, which means that no external antigens are needed; and
•	 It is being studied for administration prior to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, when the immune system may be more intact and thus with greater potential to be activated.

&nbsp;

**Why Now:**

In April 2020, CEL-SCI announced that the last event required to complete the trial had happened. The data lock phase has taken longer than expected due to COVID constraints and for the length of the process required to gather the data of this 10 years lasting multi-center and multi-country trial. CEL-SCI management has stated the 298th event has not occurred which hints that Multikine is effective. Survival of cancer patients going through S-RT or S-CRT is 57.4% at year 3, and 48.2% at year 5 in America. Based on current information we can safely conclude that patients are living much longer than they should already. There is speculation that the expected survival rate could be increased to 74.4%!

&nbsp;

**Why CVM:**

CEL-SCI says even with new treatments being researched and discussed. The use case for Multikine will remain because it is administered BEFORE starting any other treatments. The objective is to extend the life span with a certain quality for patients to receive treatment and prevail. This is also the largest study of head and neck cancer to date. 

&nbsp;

**Positions:**

300 Shares. Planning on upping to 500 EOD.

**Additional Stats:**

Short Interest: 20.70%

S3 SI Float: 17.15%

Unusual Whale Activity: None

Harsh truth: Probably won’t happen


For Fun: By the year 2053, you will need $132,225 a year to have the equivalent of $60k in today’s money. The current yield of the S&P500 is 1.43%. This means you’d need $9.2M invested by the age of 65 to be able to live off dividends. However I assume you’re used to a much more expensive lifestyle because 5k a month is what you’re willing to throw at stocks. At 5k a month until you’re 65 you’d end up with around $6.5 million. 


Another harsh truth: Honestly there’s no logical basis for you to prefer cash from a dividend over cash from selling shares before taxes and fees.

Because it’s had a historically poor performance. You would’ve blasted yourself in the foot by investing in that. 


Also don’t take advice from here very seriously. This sub and Reddit in general is full of novices who think they’re better than Warren Buffett. That confidence is often borne out of ignorance. 


> Is it worth investing thousands a month into this fund? Is there something else more attractive?


It would be better to invest in a good balanced portfolio of index funds or a target date fund or two depending how hands-on you want to be. 


Target Date Funds, the most hands-off approach: 


VFIFX: 2050 Target date fund 


VFFVX: 2055 Target date fund 


VTTSX: 2060 Target date fund. 


If you want a more hands-on approach that will give you the best results, go with index funds: 


https://www.bogleheads.org


r/bogleheads 


VTI: US Total market fund


VXUS: Total International 


AGG: US Aggregate Bond Fund 


What I’ve heard some people do is look at the Target date fund’s holdings and then mimic it with their index funds for a cheaper expense ratio. Example: 


VFFVX’s holdings: 

54% in VTI 

36.3% in VXUS

6.7% in BND

mjxjyf,,stocks,post,1617547533,"Great write up about what happened with Goldman/Archegos last weekYou remember those mysterious “block trades” and everyone worrying about what’s going on in the market and why banks are selling so much?  Here is why... 

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html?referringSource=articleShare

“Until recently, Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out.

Mr. Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March, Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS, effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure, since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments, called derivatives, created by the banks.

That changed in late March, after shares of ViacomCBS fell precipitously and the lenders demanded their money. When Archegos couldn’t pay, they seized its assets and sold them off, leading to one of the biggest implosions of an investment firm since the 2008 financial crisis.”

Also, from another article, interesting that “Unlike holdings of shares, which require investors to report ownership above 5 percent in a single stock, over-the-counter equity swaps offer exposure to stocks without the SEC reporting requirements of shareholdings.”",['VIAC']

For this vote to take place, shareholders must vote for a reverse stock split as well as the change in control and issuance of new shares. 

Should these votes be positive, the two companies will merge, creating Palisade Bio. In the case of a merger, Seneca shareholders will own about 26% of Palisade Bio and enjoy a contingent value right, or CVR, giving shareholders rights to 80% of proceeds from Seneca Biopharma’s legacy assets. 

In the video, the CEO explained that the merger would be beneficial to Seneca shareholders, who are frustrated with historical stock performance. He went on to explain that through the merger, Seneca shareholders will enjoy ownership in a company with a world-class management team, several valuable ts, and a focus on providing shareholder value. 

Leading BioSciences has a strong pipeline of gastrointestinal drugs and a management team that has a strong history of performance. Moreover, not only will Seneca shareholders receive access to this management team and pipeline, should the merger be approved, shareholders will also enjoy an 80% share in legacy assets, So, you’re really not giving up much here.

Other than that there are some penny stocks. I’m not sure what the sub rules are in naming pennies, but most of what I found that were public are pennies. GMEV is an umbrella that owns Foundation Farm Corp, a vertical farming concern that is in the startup/expansion phase in Canada.  PVSP is building a large indoor farming set up for marijuana.

APPH, AGFY, HYFM. And UGRO

All are fairly recent IPOs. They all seem worthwhile and I've owned them all at one point. SV with Aerofarms is another, it seems. But to me, the very under the radar and now best valued pick is the last one -- UGRO

It uplisted recently and got mentioned in some newsletter it seemed and had a ridiculous run. Now it's settled down. I've been accumulating simply based on the fundamentals and because it remains deeply undervalued despite having a sterling balance sheet now, great earnings, and expansion into Europe and more backlog than ever. Market cap of 69 million, with tiny float of 4.75 million (https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UGRO -- all the PR and news is listed here, too). It's also notable that they don't seem to specialize (or even mention) cannabis and are focused on all manner of ""controlled environment agriculture"": https://urban-gro.com/ To my mind, this gives them more pick and shovels appeal as a ""pure play"" agriculture company, not a ""weed"" one with all the baggage and gyrations that carries.

""long_investor"" at ST (https://stocktwits.com/symbol/UGRO) has done amazing DD and here is a comment from him laying out the details:

""revenues grew 115% from 1st half of 2020 to 2nd half of 2020: From $8.2M to $17.6M (once Covid lockdown supply issues resolved). 

$9.2M reported today for Q4 alone is 30% growth over prior Q4. And most recent two qtrs UGRO turned EBITDA positive. 
$50M
 in cash still, as of yesterday 3/30/21. 

In Q1/2020, 
$UGRO
 had $4.3M in revs. Fast forward one year, entering Q1/2021, UGRO already had 
$14M
+ of signed contracts. What % growth will the next ER show over Q1/2020? And in Q2/2020, UGRO had 
$4M
 in revs. How about the YoY growth for this Q2’s ER? 

Depends on how many projects they completed. Though given they just reported $9.2M for Q4 revenues, odds seem good for our tiny micro-cap to show very significant growth compared to the $4.3M and 
$4M
 from Q1 and Q2 of 2020.""",['MMM']

Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming a new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are regulated.

The Crypto Council for Innovation will lobby policy makers, take up research projects and serve as the burgeoning industry’s voice in championing the economic benefits of digital currencies and related technologies. Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

The council’s launch comes as prices of many digital assets have surged, drawing in new mainstream investors and the banks and brokers that serve them. Earlier this year, the total market value of bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, touched $1 trillion for the first time.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

“Crypto is at a mainstream inflection point,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Paradigm and Coinbase’s former president. “It’s in its very early stages and, much like the internet (once was), it’s very fragile while it’s in that stage.”

The internet emerged as a major force in global commerce in part because of a handful of key policy decisions, including those that legalized data encryption and resolved questions over sales taxes, Mr. Ehrsam said. The nascent cryptocurrency market is sure to face its own crossroads, even if it isn’t yet obvious what they are, he said.

“It’s challenging because policy makers want to balance risk and reward, and even people who spend time in this space would struggle to predict where this will go in the coming decade,” he said. “It was very hard to say where the internet was going to go.”

The council plans to appoint a board that would include representatives with each of the four initial members. In time, Mr. Ehrsam said, the group will add an executive team.

Mr. Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang founded Paradigm three years ago to invest in both cryptocurrencies and the companies that focus on that market.

Fidelity, an investing colossus with nearly $10 trillion in client assets under administration, opened in 2018 a custody business that stores and trades bitcoin for hedge funds and other professional investors. Last month, the Boston firm became the latest money manager to seek regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.

Square, an electronic-payments company, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. And the firm’s Cash App consumer-finance platform allows users to buy and sell the digital currency.

Coinbase, founded in 2012, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. The company, which serves 43 million customers in 100 countries, plans to go public later this month.",

mlamxt,,investing,post,1617712565,"ChargePoint Alternative Play  

**DESCRIPTION**  
 Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that *designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions* for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for *corporate, public, & residential customers*. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.  
 
History

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for ***72% market share of total level 2*** charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with SBE (SPAC) late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (network subscriptions & equipment) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

· Market Cap: **$6.99bn** 

· Shares Float \~ 300mln

· ***Short Interest \~70%***, per latest short numbers the short interest is **85%**, but it's an old figure, which might have dissipated as price fell from ATH $49.48, an update due later this month.

· Institutional ownership **\~5%**

· **2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;**

· **TAM $190bn**

· No Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents \~$650m. Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with  
 41% Gross Margin.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K Level 2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", giving $CHPT \~53% of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of Level 3 '*Superchargers*', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, Level 2, \~75% and Level 1, \~3% of market share.

**Challengers**

· $VLTA (SNPR) Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The only things they don't do are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s and 6 DCFCs I wouldn't put too much stock in that. It's basically chargers-as-billboards, selected to boutique locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it.*

· SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of Level 2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers, offers warranties and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a DCFC offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).

· $EVGO(CLII): EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW DCFCs, and DCFCs are their game. AFDC data says they only have 403 Level 2s but 1.4k DCFCs which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (looks like 0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer DCFCs. They also have a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the DCFC focus.

· $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells Level 2 and DCFC chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:  
 *""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""* 

· $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): DCFC focused company, it enjoys 2.5k DCFCs. EM also sells a Level 2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts** 

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: *""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""*

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical now how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, *former $CHPT board member is in current administration.*

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans   
 \- Transit electrification dates   
 \- Incentive programs   
 \- All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating - 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st. 

**MOAT**

· First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)

· Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)

· Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)

· Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology

Why am I interested in $CHPT?

Is because it entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry?

Is because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now

**And** is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Is it because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum? + ESG and inevitable supremacy and prevalence?

Is it a small market cap in the market that will ***explode no matter what?***

*That’s* ***bananas*** but not the main reason. The main reason is high short interest well over 50% which can be taken advantage of. That's first way of making money on $CHPT. The second way, after squeeze should squoze, this is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~5% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it?  The valuation will go - **bananas.**

**This is not a financial advice, do your own research.**

The numbers in Germany right now are 2h usage per week and those are ""highly"" frequented stations. So companies right now don't achieve revenue with the stations alone.

Hence, Volta achieves revenues with ads, not electricity. Both Volta and the property owner don't have to worry about how often a charger is used in a certain period of time - the only thing which matters is how many people see those ads on the chargers and $PLTR can certainly help them with the search of lucrative locations. And that's why I strongly believe in the business model of Volta.

Buying a property as an investment and not a home seams like an extremely high risk play. The money i could get for rent here would probably only break me even on taxes in my state, let alone the other expenses that go into being a land lord. What I've been told here is that you're looking to levarage the money you borrow from the bank and make money on the appreciation of the property. 

What if the neighborhood turns to shit?? What if you buy at the peak moments of the sellers market and the value of the home drops drastically. Isn't that leverage going to be equally as bad to the downside? If i put down $100,000 for a $500,000 home and the value drops to $400,000 by years end...

First, Real Estate is not a liquid asset like your stocks.  It's something you put into a (likely) minimum 5-10yr time-frame with regards to financial analysis. 

Secondly, you own the entire thing. This is not shares in a company that you have no control over. Your DD on buying a property should be way higher than DD on a stock. You should know the neighborhood and know the risks and be willing to take them.  You should be fiddling with pro-formas constantly to decide if a property works for you. If it doesn't then don't do it.  Also, people forget while there is an advantage to leverage, YOU can decide how much you leverage. If you want to have a 50% leverage to feel safer and have a better cash-flow, then you can. Nothing stops you from doing that. 

RE is a great hedge against inflation. Your cost for money stays static mostly, while inflation goes up and so do your rents and so does the value of your asset. In the same vein you're taking tax breaks on deflation and other expenses. 

Of course your stocks won't call you at 3am on a weeknight letting you know that the water heater has exploded in the garage :) 

Lastly, all your ""what ifs"" apply equally if not more to any stock. What if there's a global pandemic and my airline holdings can't fly anyone. Would you have predicted no one would be watching movies in theaters for 9-12 months?

mla9be,,investing,post,1617711303,"DD on fundamentals and growth of Super League Gaming $SLGGFrom user u/whobangin

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.  


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5c7pfn1qgr61.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02a6df6d2de3a51a0842765b61cde1f361d748e

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",['AMP']

A) Creating lots of bag holders at the secondary offering price when the stock does crash as expected because the value just isn't there.

B) This secondary offering price solidifying a new floor and ""analysts"" updating their target prices as such one by one.

C) ???

mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",['TSLA']

ml5nfg,,investing,post,1617691914,"Playboy - Excitement for you and your wallet (Potential 2-4x) DD on PLBY

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought of NFTs on hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at only fans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style& apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming & lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty & Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style & apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming & Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty & Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

[https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast)

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['CHD', 'CVS', 'GPS', 'WMT', 'NKE']"

ml5nfg,gtjulec,investing,comment,1617700769,"Did not know that Playboy was still around.  It appears to be a shadow of its' former self per Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy\_Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Enterprises).    


March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed  - now completely digital.  No more glossy centerfolds.

It also appears that the adults now own & run the business, Hugh Hefner died in 2017 and his daughter who ran the company from 1988 to 2009 are no longer an issue.  It is also apparent that most of the losing enterprises from Heff's day have been dropped.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises’ had merged with Mountain Crest - a SPAC.  


According to Schwab:     
Canaccord Genuity Initiates PLBY Group at Buy Rating With $28 Price Target

Craig-Hallum raises price target to $35 from $25

Roth Capital raises PLBY Group's Price Target to $26 From $18, Keeps Buy Rating

Also up 19% yesterday and 4% After hours.  

If I were to buy into PLBY would have to see what their Asian operations & casino openings slated for the next 3 years are.  And what the former Asian operations financials were before they closed them down.    


As to their brand/product - to be crass the product is a commodity.   Not sure if it has any cache anymore.  As to hawking other brands: "" Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. "".  Every company that can,  works with (pays extortionate rates for) celebrities which is a tried-and true way of doing business.  Also pretty tired method.   If you need a reminder of celebrity abuse and how useless it is: doughy-faced Tom Bosley of Happy Days TV show fame gave a rousing recommendation for a swindlers failed investment scheme. 

*On buying sentiment:*   
PLBY has a former reputation to live down, using celebrities to pitch their brand (at very best neutral rating),  their product is barely distinguishable from other brands,  and ""Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals \[like 50% of the population - women\] – ..... I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women"" - this could be insurmountable.   


Seeing the Penthouse Magazine in its' heyday and what it is now and comparing it to PLBY is kind of the flightplan I see for PLBY.  Went from being misogynistic and vapid to totally vapid.  


***In total - good OP analysis of the positive points but PLBY has some serious perception drawbacks.***  


Think PLBY is a sell for the immediate future not a buy particularly given the runup yesterday and last night.  PLBY is still in their first year of a shakedown cruise  trying to see what works with todays clients.   More distance will have to be put between the past and what they are currently going to do to make money.  Also only time will tell if their new clients gained during the pandemic are sticky or flaky (Jesus that has unintended under/overtones).  The cache of going to a Playboy mansion is dead.  Celebrity endorsement is a big bucket of who cares.  But in 5 years - with a considerable amount of re-branding, some outstanding PR, and dropping of certain lines of business - they could make a go of it.    


But then again, I could be hopelessly out of date.  PLBY could be a total surprise.  For me, it is a pass since it has ""faddish and transitory"" stamped in big letters all over it.  Rather like cigarette stocks; except cigarette stocks pay a dividend.  Maybe PLBY is more of a day trade or swing trade.  Definitely not a buy and hold for me.  


***To the OP: good analysis of the positive side of PLBY.  Think you could very successfully write their promotional material for them.  Look forward to seeing your next DD analysis.  If this post is any indicator you are good at this.***",['BEN']

I have a large sum to invest (partly inheritance) ie around 0.5m . I have some experience of investing, but not a lot, and the recent increase in my portfolio means there's now a lot more to lose.

I don't really need the money as income (have other sources), so what I want to do is invest it for long term (30 years or so) and may not touch it before I die, and pass it on. 

I would like to grow it as much as possible, and of course not lose it.

So my thinking is index funds. I have to accept that I am not educated enough in finance, and probably not smart enough to get sufficiently educated, to be able to do successful stock picking, much as I would like to. I also don't trust a third party to manage the money fairly or well (not saying my lack of trust is justified, just that I have it).

So then the question is - which index funds?

Although people often suggest that index investing is a simple activity, I would have thought it matters greatly which index you pick.

So my questions are:

- Should I pick an S&P 500 index, even though the P/E ratio looks very much on the high side?

- Should I pick something like the British FTSE 100, which is thought to be undervalued at the moment? And then maybe come back to S&P 500 later?

- Should I choose an emerging markets ETF?

- Or stay in cash until S&P 500 cools down a bit?


I would certainly want to get more than inflation, and more than bonds would give me. I'm happy to sit through ups and downs, I just feel like the decision I make at this point is going to have long-reaching ramifications on my final portfolio.

mjwo8q,,investing,post,1617544552,"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policiesThe waste industry is more than just hard-working gentlemen and women collecting trash from your home or business. It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

It seems that Biden doesn't support full-fledged federal legalization. He seems more interested in federal decriminalization and let the states decide what to do for now. If that is the case, these vertically integrated multistate operators (MSOs) will have get a bigger and bigger market share as time goes on. The sooner federal legalization happens, the sooner they can lose market share to opposition (Canadian companies, big tobacco, etc). But because weed is federally illegal, they can't be listed on the NYSE. Being an OTC stock means less hedge funds and big whales invested in these highly profitable companies. Federal legalization can lead the way for them to up-list. Hopefully seeing a boost. 

So I'm bullish because I don't think we'll see federal legalization in the next year, maybe two. It'll let these companies expand. 

As for Curaleaf, they recently saw their bump because of NY legalizing weed. As well as Green Thumb, Cresco, and many other northeast operators. Additionally, Curaleaf has one of the highest market caps of them all with the most share dilution. It'll take big money to drive the price higher and higher. They can lag relative to their industry peers.",

""This may be surprising for some,but I’m going to try to explain why in my opinion this is an undervalued,and misunderstood company. First you have to understand southern car culture. There isn’t a lot to do in the southern states,and middle america. This results in most people pouring money into their cars as one of their main hobbies. My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth. They are rapidly taking over the aftermarket part market through acquisitions. Including expanding into the aftermarket EV car market. In my opinion this is a low risk - medium to high return trade.""

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['GOOGL', 'NOV']"

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

mijlje,,investing,post,1617367458,"U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.",

The company, via the direct listing, could be valued at more than $100 billion.
Coinbase will list on the Nasdaq with the ticker COIN. The company initially announced its intentions to go public in December.
But the company cautioned that recent trading prices in private transactions may have little or no relation to the company's opening public price. The filing didn't indicate a trading date.

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k).

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality.

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

mj2qmk,,investing,post,1617430149,"Drd gold , a vertical growth gold mine(first dd, constructional critism will be welcomed)
disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",
mj2qmk,gt9lulr,investing,comment,1617472924,"I'm not an expert by any means, but maybe I can help you examine this in some more detail because on the surface this does look interesting.

Most of my gold mining knowledge (which is not much) comes from my time working as a land surveyor [in Colorado gold country.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B047'33.2%22N+105%C2%B031'33.3%22W/@39.792556,-105.5281017,700m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d39.7925558!4d-105.5259125) All those piles of brown from there all the way south and west beyond Idaho Springs are tailings, and there's still gold up in them there mountains. From what I understand, this stuff is exactly what this company would be targeting for processing, but currently the tailings in CO are just being sat on until gold reaches a threshold price where the owner will then start processing the tailings at a profit. I don't know what that threshold is but it hasn't happened yet and there hasn't been activity here since the early 1980s.

So my questions, and these are intended to dig a little deeper, maybe think about things from a different angle and stress test your bullish hypothesis, I'm not trying to shit on your DD or anything: 

1.  Are they purely a tailings-processing company now or do they also operate traditional mines? Looks like purely tailings now, but you also mentioned looking at surface mining internationally in the future.
2. What are their current reserves? Do they have enough tailings in SA to keep them busy at current levels until 2023? 2025? 2030? Their plan seems to be focused on SA until 2026 so I'm trying to get at the scale of revenue and earnings growth for the next 5 years here. Basically if they stay in SA the jump they saw in 2020 may plateau once they hit full operating capacity until they scale up internationally.
3. Specifically related to gold tailings, are the tailings in South Africa more concentrated? Or is DRD's process more cost-effective than traditional processing and allows them to profitably process tailings at a lower price of gold? If their process is significantly and demonstrably more cost-effective then that could be a big disruptive factor for the company. If it's just that the tailings in SA are better quality, then I'm more skeptical.
4. What was the investment required to build the processing plant? And if they expand internationally, will they have to build plants locally, work with local companies (sort of leasing their process), or ship the tailings to their SA plant?
5. Has processing platinum tailings begun? If so when did it begin or if not when is it expected to begin?
6. If platinum isn't up and running, there's more risk inherent there in that case. What is the difference between gold tailings and platinum tailings? Is it a similar process (using the same methods and chemicals) or is it significantly different? Can we expect similar margins from this as the gold?
7. What's their competition here? What other companies are in the gold/platinum tailings processing space?

I don't expect you'd have all the answers to these questions, but maybe there's some things there to think about.

In short, I'm intrigued. If their processing is indeed more cost-effective than traditional tailings processing, then long term that's potentially a good sign for big growth and big scaling. That would mean a potential disruptive factor within that industry and would provide a good competitive moat/advantage. If the jump is simply related to getting a plant up and running and processing high-quality trailings, then I'd expect the growth to stabilize once platinum is up and running (if it's not already) and they'd be more vulnerable to competition especially once they start trying to scale internationally.",

* ETFs holdings from:
https://stockanalysis.com/etf/VTI/holdings/
* Price and analyst target prices from https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&c=1,2,3,7,9,33,34,59,65,69&t=AAPL
* I also used GOOGLEFINANCE to fetch some of the prices. Seems that stockanalysis, finviz and googlefinance don't always agree which investment product a ticker represents (e.g. TILT) so there can be some data mistakes.
* mostly works for companies listed on US exchanges

I did this for my amusement, it's not investment advice.

For some ETFs that saw a huge dip, e.g. ARKK or ARKW, the computed target was close to the historical maximum, so I wonder how much price bias is there in the target price published by analysts (i.e., analysists try to reason current price, rather than coming up with a proper valuation).

I'm going to track this for a while to see how useful this information is.

Edit 1: I explained here how I computed the table: https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mijk9h/i_computed_the_weighted_average_upside_for_100/gt563uy. tl;dr:  ETF's upside is computed from the allocation weighted upside of the individual stocks comprising the ETF.

Edit 2: I added a few more etfs, and I decided to publish the entire doc here for the transparency sake. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR5HjnlzG0EA6wrGmPGZDl9oISgf8ekECzlHUj4zPBW-z-MUH4-N9dwFjOXvD1qcTA29vEoxYT87Unp/pubhtml

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs). Also it doesn't work with non-US listed stocks (e.g. finviz doesn't have data for the ESPO stocks https://stockanalysis.com/etf/espo/holdings/)","['ARKK', 'AAPL']"

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

>New York Attorney General Letitia James' office says it found that Tether sometimes held no reserves to back its cryptocurrency's dollar peg. It said that, from mid-2017, the company had no access to banking and misled clients about liquidity issues.

>In a 2019 filing, the attorney general's office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether's cash reserves to Bitfinex.

>”Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,"" James said in a statement Tuesday.

>”Tether's claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,"" she added.

>”These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.""

**What is tether?**

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

https://assets-bwbx-io.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/irp9oaPu51XM/v0/-1x-1.png

**What happens now?**

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

Tether will soon face a quarterly report, filed with the AG, may shed more light on how exactly Tether’s money is invested.

People only use tether because it’s the cheapest option for getting  1 dollar US outside of the US. We don’t need it here for obvious reasons. But if Tether crashed people would move into other stable coins USDC and DAI. But there are other complications with that such as supply. 

Fact is nobody knows what will happen if Tether dies. But I do believe it’s a sort of ticking time bomb and something to be wary of. They should definitely be audited by an outside source regularly.",

But efforts are underway to transition to a low-carbon economy and therefore a 2 deg C increase. How much is the investment needed? Around 190 trillion (Edit: 90 trillion) USD by 2030!!

In other words, there are *opportunities* in transition to a green economy, and one that has been enshrined in pledges both by public and private institutions. New energy generation, energy efficiency technology, sustainable practices, increase in carbon price and changing customer demands.

A very obvious one: carbon price. It is expected that carbon price needs to be at around 100 USD/eCO2MT in order to achieve the 2 deg transition. What is the current carbon price now? In Europe (the highest) it is only \~37 EUR! And yet the targeted emission reduction in the next few decades already mandates that there be 7% increase in carbon price per annum!

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

* ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.
* ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.
* HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia
* KRBN: tracks the carbon future price of the European Emission Trading Scheme and that in California. The best performing commodity in 2020, and arguably in the years to come. Unlike other commodities, the fundamental case is quite strong.

I understood that it was a lot, but I figured I’d get a good job and get there one step at a time. 

I recently finished paying off my student debt (50k) four years after college (6 years out now). I lived way below my means to make this happen. Recently, I have gotten into investing and I am very focused on compound interest. I started maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, and also started a brokerage account for additional stocks. I continue to live below my means, and I like it that way. Investing makes me feel fulfilled, like I have a real goal I am working towards. 

When I think about those items mentioned above, I no longer get excited. I see them as mountains of debt. I want to buy a house, but I don’t want to do it in this seller’s market. The other items just seem like unnecessary obstacles to reaching my investment goals. I don’t make enough money to accomplish both.

""The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures.""  
""A group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. “We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,” the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract.""

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people.

But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent.

mi3bt3,,investing,post,1617306304,"Micron Soars On Chip Shortage ""Perfect Storm""In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving

mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

> SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m   

Debt and accumulated equity deficit are not the same thing. Debt of a company is the total liabilities. Which in the case of SUNW is only $18M, mostly short term operational debt. Their long term liability is only a few million.  

The -$88m is their total accumulated equity deficit since inception. Not money they owe.  

> SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020. 

This appears to be because they generate most of their revenue from commercial solar projects, not residential installs.  Smaller number of large scale project, which is how they generate almost $40M in revenue from 500 installs.

In general, with a focus on commercial I’m not surprised they took a revenue hit. But they ended 2020 with $39M in the bank. Added another $49M through a stock issue. They don’t have a cash problem.  

And last year they lost $15M, $4 of which was Goodwill and $3M in one time legal fees and bad debt. Nothing unusual here.

It is still over valued IMO but there is nothing wrong with their balance sheet and they have plenty of working capital. They have a lot of cash and they appear to be using it to acquire smaller solar companies.",['MMM']

I have been seeing, for the past few months, a lot of news regarding the Turkish lira and how it lost so much value and how Turkey's economy is in shambles, etc. Not only that but Erdogan doesn't make things easier and might very well take the country to total economic collapse.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision? As far as I see it, because the lira devalued so much, it would be much cheaper for someone holding other currencies.

mh6l6f,,investing,post,1617198775,"Goldman Sachs is close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clientsGoldman Sachs is close to offering its first investment vehicles for bitcoin and other digital assets to clients of its private wealth management group, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

Horizon 10-15 years

20K to begin with, topping at least 1K per month.
 
I read a couple of books on investing over the weekend and came to the conclusion that with my (lack of) knowledge of the markets my best bet is to go for maximally diversified portfolio,  and put it all into shares for now, to (hopefully!) gain some momentum to begin with. I’d be also inclined to tilt it a little towards growth and tech for the coming year.
 
So I’m thinking:
 
75%  Vanguard FTSE All-world (VWRP =  VT in the US) TER 0.25%

15%  Nasdaq 100 (=QQQ) TER 0.30%

10%  S&P SmallCap 600 TER 0.375%
 
I’m not sure what to think of the overlap between Nasdaq and All-World. It adds exposure to that sector of course, but it tech has done so well over the past 5 years…
 
One alternative would be to keep it super simple and just go for All-World. There’s also a cheaper All-World option on my platform, although it hasn’t done as well as the Vanguard one.

mhr8j1,gt11ba2,investing,comment,1617283478,"I just began investing again in January, and I've been buying fractional shares of certain stocks like Amazon and Tesla. Just looking for general feedback on my portfolio.

I have AAPL (7 shares), AMZN (.13 shares), TSLA (.6 shares), DIS (2 shares), CCIV (31 shares), CMG (.13 shares), COST (.64 shares), VYNE (12 shares), RWT (20 shares), VHT (.5 shares), VNQ (5 shares), VOO (.2 shares)., ARKK (1.4 shares), THNQ (2.15 shares), BOTZ (.6 shares), ARKQ (.29 shares) and ARKX (2 shares).

My goal was to continue buying fractional shares each pay check in Amazon, Tesla, Costco and Chipotle so I can slowly accumulate more equity over time, but I'm beginning to wonder if it makes more sense to just sell my fractional shares and re-allocate those investments into VOO and ARKK. I do like holding single stocks of Apple and Disney and since they aren't quite as high in cost I've been able to buy whole shares which is nice. I guess I'm not sure if trying to obtain a single share of Amazon over time is even worth it, or if I'd see a greater return putting $3k into VOO. I do plan to eventually get rid of VYNE, I bought that on a whim and am in the red but I've been waiting for it to bounce up.

So I guess I'm just looking for general feedback on whether it would make sense to continue beefing up my standings in some of these stocks over time or if I'd be better suited to just put those dollars into indexes and ETFs for the most part?","['AAPL', 'DIS', 'ARKK', 'TSLA', 'CMG', 'AMZN']"

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

**Thanks for reading, and would like to hear any thoughts**

**Disclosure: Long ZDGE obviously**

**TLDR: 80% revenue growth for FY21, heavy insider buying, pe ratio of 45**",['MMM']

mhaez0,gsxqvf2,investing,comment,1617212160,"This may sound hand-wavey, and I suppose it is, but something doesn't smell good to me. The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up. Like I said, I don't know if this is true, and I didn't see an answer in my 5 second Google search. Having tried literally all options myself (/s), it's now up to you.",['GOOGL']
mhaez0,gsxplgr,investing,comment,1617211588,"Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

Imo analyzing a company is a bit like war gaming.

mh4gbw,,investing,post,1617191640,"My take on Gold's longterm outlookFrom a technical perspective, gold is in a 10 year long c[up and handle](https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1617190625002.png) pattern, and it could go sideways for many more years until a breakout target of about 2900 is met. The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",

mh1zc3,gswgjxp,investing,comment,1617186949,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['ADP', 'SPGI', 'NDAQ', 'DOW']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

The etf is up 20% for now. 
That's higher than the usual return you get on such an etf.

What's best practice in such a case? 

1.) Realize the gains and reinvest 

2.) Realize the whole fund and wait for the (inevitable?!) correction to re-invest at a lower point

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

mgwrdt,,investing,post,1617159948,"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market. It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys. Stuff like WDI Corp, which runs restaurant chains:  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3068:JP

Edit 2: The model has settled down- now 2000-2500 a day in late April. That's still state of emergency level, but regular state of emergency level, such as closing restaurants early. Maybe better to just wait this out and buy the dip.",['GOOGL']

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

It appears he was only around 5x leveraged and we know prime brokers can offer long-short funds up to 10x leverage, sometimes more.


Do we feel bad for Hwang? I certainly don't. His stocks ran up hundreds of percent in the last 6 months and instead of easing up it looks like he doubled down and paid the price for it.

It is not the least cost solution, nor is it good for air quality or climate change. Not to mention that this proposed solution is to add more gas plants to solve the problem of gas plants shutting down due to cold weather and making the largest contribution to the dropoff in electricity production. This proposal would end up being an expensive, underutilized boondoggle for Texans. The solution in Texas is winterization of their electricity supply chain and more solar paired with batteries and other energy storage, NOT polluting and expensive new gas peakers. There is a reason that new natural gas plants are only expected to be 16% of new electricity capacity in 2021.",

mfs7vk,,investing,post,1617032204,"Stock Scraper Trending Data as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

Good luck and have fun all! Hope this helps someone!","['GOOGL', 'TWTR', 'AAPL']"

As of now, searching under Reddit all, there is roughly 450 tickers under 500. So you will then go through the 450 tockers and delete any that aren't real. So maybe it goes down to 400. Not sure. Now after you do a few other steps you're left with 10-15 tickers. My question is how do you manage to go from 450 tickers down to 10-15. This would be a week-long project for myself.

Management review:

* Compensation
There is a significant bonus for the Board of Director as stated in its annual report 2018:
**""The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs (including stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity""**

In the same period (CMIIW), the company fire 800 employee.

you can check the detail here:
https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions
but I quote here
**The disparity between bottom-line executive compensation and what the 800 people laid off were making is staggering. Bobby Kotick has become the villain in this story. Kotick drew a $1.75 million salary plus another $26 million or so in stock and other equity awards in 2017. Dennis Durkin, who recently returned to the CFO role and was also put in charge of “emerging business” (figuring out where the company will make its money in the coming years), was given a $3.75 million cash bonus and another $11.3 million in as-yet unearned, performance-based equity**

Maybe this policy makes people judge The CEO, Bobby Kotick is a profit-oriented person - but honestly, which CEO doesn't?

* Destiny exclusivity for Playstation: Wrong strategy? But Bungie Games has divorced with Activision.
* Forcing microtransactions: Do it really bad? Even when the gamer doesn't like it, they keep playing the franchise.

Note:
I'm not a gamer, I play Deck Heroes, Mythgard, other TCG or CCG (unfortunately I don't play Hearthstone), FIFA (a long time ago). Thus I don't have expertise in the genre that Activision published.

Any comment would be very appreciated.

_______________________
Revision I

I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...
_______________________
Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

You present several statements that raise certain questions.  For example:

1.	""Its PE ratio is similar to EA.""  It's trading at 15x book value... Why should I invest in EA or Activision if I can find a dozen or so companies that are trading at a significant discount?  You invoke the Graham/Buffett concept ""margin of safety"" but DCF analysis puts  its fair value between $71 and $78 per share.  That's the opposite of margin of safety.
2.	""has no intangible assets"" ... No? What's the $1.8 billion in accumulated intangible amortization?  You can't amortize assets you don't have.
3.	""Strong balance sheet""... what was the $18 million unrealized loss in Q3 of 2020 due to?
4.	How about the $6.8 billion in Goodwill?  That's an intangible asset.  What acquisitions are related to this and if they're still carrying this value, why would it be better for them to spend the $8 billion on more acquisitions than stock repurchases given that:
5.	"" but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance.""  Is it?  I see $11 billion in APIC.  Again: In these economically uncertain times, why would more acquisitions be better than share repurchases?
6.	""Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.""  What's the $194 million write down of AR in Q4 2020?  There's a quarterly carrying value around $83 million as a provision for doubtful accounts.  What's the connection between these two items and why could its resurgence to 2017 levels present a material impairment to their business, particularly under current economic conditions?

What concerns me is that you approach the analysis from the Graham angle of value and margin of safety, yet present no discussion of the indicators of the same.  The underpinnings of due diligence are in the data, which aren't presented or discussed in your analysis.  It's not that the above questions all have displeasing answers, but rather that these are the kind of questions you should be anticipating and addressing in your due diligence.

Due diligence is not an attempt to pitch me the prettiest profile of the company.   It's got to be a kicking of the tires, asking the tough questions, and seeing whether your hypothesis holds up to serious scrutiny.... and these are just questions I, as a relatively average FP&A guy, came up with glancing at the financials for five minutes, and it's not because I have a particular view of the company, but that is precisely the point.  Your analysis needs to be thorough and objective.",['EA']

mfkoyj,,investing,post,1617005626,"BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial ResultsUp until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

mfbyli,,investing,post,1616971610,"Investing in Helium - DMEHF DD **Investing in Desert Mountain Energy (DME.V, DMEHF)**

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

"" Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon "" Helium demand did not exceed supply last year, largely due to decreased use during the pandemic. 

"" Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining. "" Terming this companies financials as ""good"" is uh... a stretch. They raised some money (not enough to execute their plan) and they don't spend much because they aren't doing much.

"" Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day."" Test well (singular) has shown this. As mentioned previously the second well is much much worse, mostly in terms of flow rate, but the helium percentage is a bit over half as much as well.

"" Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less. ""  This seems to assume all wells are as good as the first and not as bad as the second. 

Finally, you use analysis from the cormark report here: [https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom\_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom](https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom)"" but gave a $20+ price target while ignoring their $4.25 price target.  If you're going to use their info you should probably also at least mention their price target.

I am by no means trying to convince people to stay away from this one. I just am presenting the other side for you.  You should be aware you're paying 128 million for 13 million, a plan, some leases and a few holes in the ground at least one of which seems to produce a significant amount of helium. That's pretty much how most companies start, but people should be aware this is still really early stages and a lot could still go wrong.",

mfdia0,,investing,post,1616976808,"Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice.",

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.

mf2pu6,,investing,post,1616944490,"Coursera: A DD IntroductionDisclaimer: This is my first DD, so please forgive any gaps, omissions, or mistakes. I welcome any and all (constructive) comments and criticisms. Secondly, as is obligatory, *this is not to be construed as financial advice*.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['DE', 'ICE', 'TSLA']"

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['GS', 'ED', 'WAT', 'SPGI', 'BAC', 'ES']"

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC

* 10% AVUV
* 16% XEF

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments.","['GOOGL', 'SPGI']"

meu01j,gsk1rtx,investing,comment,1616911277,"I think Schiller did a lot of detriment to his stellar reputation with excess CAPE. This concept is pretty controversial among prominent investors and economists. It’s like, here’s one very overpriced asset and another very very overpriced asset and when we compare them to each other they don’t look so expensive. Like houses in LA are really cheap because houses in San Jose are expensive. 

I’m a big CAPE believer, just think excess CAPE is nonsense.",
meu01j,gsomxj5,investing,comment,1617023727,"I have a portion of my active investment allocation in a tactical asset allocation strategy that uses expected excess returns of SP500 relative to 10 year treasuries to determine allocation. SP500 10YR expected total returns are forecast using a valuation model (not CAPE but similar enough) to predict price return plus current dividend yield. 10YR treasury expected returns are estimated as current yield. The historical error in forecast versus realized realized 10 year return is used to evaluate the probability that stocks will outperform treasuries. I use this probability directly as an allocation target. In other words, if stocks are predicted to have a 90% probability of outperforming treasuries I allocate 90% to stocks and 10% to treasuries. If the probability is 50%, I allocated 50/50. I use a 24 month moving average of the probability to smooth the allocation and slow down transition in allocation. This slows transition from equity to bonds and vice versa. 

In general, I find that active strategies that use a probabilistic transition in allocation are more robust and easier to live with than strategies that make an all in 0% to 100% switch in allocation. Valuations don't switch instantly so I don't see why you'd want a strategy to switch allocation instantly. You're ""optimized"" 2% threshold probably has closer to 50/50 probability of either stock or bond outperformance - it makes more sense to take a 50/50 allocation until the valuation becomes more extreme one way or the other.

As you say, historically it's rare for the 10 year forecast of stock return to be less than the forecast for bond return so this strategy tends to be heavily allocated to stocks.

This incredibly simple strategy has actually been one of the most consistent performing of strategies I follow over the past 2 years.",

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

lbyb4o,,investing,post,1612386455,"Why I’m feeling bullish on Gap Inc (GPS)I recently bought into GPS at about 22.50, and I really think GPS has the potential to go to at least 30 this year. Although short interest has increased for the stock (roughly 10%), different analyst reports have set target prices for gap anywhere from 19 to 27 dollars, and so I think it is a relatively stable stock right now. 

What I really think is going to boost this stock is the upcoming Yeezy collaboration with Gap. This collaboration was announced in July 2020 and is reported to be a 10 year deal. The target release date was slated to be first half of 2021. Aside from a small leak of potential designs in October 2020, there has been no news ever since. 

One thing I know about Yeezy branded stuff, is that it gets instantly sold out whenever there is a new drop. Despite the intentional pivot to affordable clothing ($50-100 for an item instead of $300-500), I truly believe that Yeezy Gap will also see similar supply and demand issues. 

None of the market reports I have read mention Yeezy at all. 

Essentially the thesis of my argument is that stock value isn’t always inherently tied to company value. A large amount of it can be hype, and when it comes to hypebeasts, Yeezy is a holy grail.",['GPS']

I have tried Wallstreetzen but the only offers Nasdaq stocks, but I really like their simple UI for a quick an dirty analysis. They have a Zen-score and some forecasts I like, also some financial points. It is good and free. But only viewing Nasdaq stocks are not great. Same for Simply Wallstreet but I think their model is a bit expensive for what you get. But on the other hand you get a lot more stocks. 

Do you guys know any other stock analysis tool that use simple UI and simple analysis? Those tools give me a quick look on the stocks. I know they are lacking some data and far from perfect but as a quick look I like them.

**This is how I use this tools**  
1. First I find a interesting stock, maybe on this forum maybe on youtube or a podcast.  
2. Secondly I use above tools to make a quick analysis based on some personal preference. If they pass the quick test I continue to step 3.  
3. Lastly, I do a larger DD. I search on Twitter/Reddit for the ticker, other forums, I google a lot and check their investor presentations and double check the financials. If all looks good I decide the risk level and buy some stock. High risk = less stock, low risk = more stocks. Something like that.

We ran to new highs so fast now it needs a pause to catch its breath... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... [https://youtu.be/TNAxYC-wd44](https://youtu.be/TNAxYC-wd44) 

Today is a pause and catch your breath day, and in anticipation of this I grabbed a couple of 12 April 21 puts at 15:46 to take advantage of this. Right now, the market as a whole seems calm, volatility had fell below 18. All these things over time can lull you into a relaxed state. Don’t relax. Today is breather but this run will give us some nice opportunities this week. This run has already put us at the top end of the market makers expected move of 406.97. This was the expected move for the entire week and it was done in a day. So later in the week there should be some great pullback opportunities. Now to today's outcomes: 1) if we hold support at 405 area, we consolidate between 405 and 407 areas. 2) We break thru support at 405 and giving us a target of 402 area. Today on this breather type day its simple, so I will keep it to just two outcomes and address some comments. A lot of people don’t understand my analysis. They say the market only goes up or down, and if you trade options, you should understand that this is not correct. The market moves up down and sideways, the sideways movement is very important to theta (time decay of options). There are options strategies that profit primarily because of that sideways movement. This is usually the reason for 3rd outcome. 

1) if we hold support at 405 area, we consolidate between 405 and 407 areas. **45% probability** 

2) We break thru support at 405 and giving us a target of 402 area. **55% probability**",

[DD on PLBY ](https://preview.redd.it/cmjzgct0yhr61.png?width=113&format=png&auto=webp&s=0795d4700fe00e7b8b55fbfdc58993ceff193311)

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought .. oh NFTs + hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at onlyfans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity. 

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention. 

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term. 

**Marketing/Branding** 

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sroon9mpwhr61.png?width=206&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9a7791738891873313bfab2847279201f592d7b

https://preview.redd.it/3fw26v4qwhr61.png?width=491&format=png&auto=webp&s=26c4b959ac6bfaaab9a52c57407135836df3fdec

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets. 

https://preview.redd.it/48i52tsrwhr61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e50e26426b6a45e60340ef22178512cf230fba4

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)** 

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021. 

https://preview.redd.it/f89e77xhxhr61.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=b647432fd882f8041c1e343e97b3d50ff59ec475

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website. 

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kj08sprixhr61.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=60d77671a8f96aef6b22ec8a5fca130673781732

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.  

 

https://preview.redd.it/dl5x59njxhr61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=c02bb215962442940f90d50f38d4d16cb947c1a5

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination. 

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8efrrufkxhr61.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d0544ca46ca518439812b092b6f0a89c4bed3a9

**Financials** 

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly. This was pulled from their SEC filling. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h9tubwslxhr61.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef44bdb33107f5d22280da651b37037c14ca396

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz) 

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/le7kl3mmxhr61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afcff1937035a3c03028ee93ad2eb2dfda5975a

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing. 

**Other Analyst and Stock Price** 

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

&#x200B;

**Downsides for the company** 

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion. 

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand. 

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy.  In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR** 

Pros 

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue 

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics) 

\- Companies has royalties they can collect 

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them. 

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons 

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business 

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['CHD', 'NKE', 'GPS']"

Is there a real reason that so many younger people with this huge purchase looming are investing/risking so much? 

I found myself coming to the realization during this downturn that it is quite important for those of us that are younger or in a house buying situation to only invest a smaller amount that wouldn't be devastating to lose, so I ended up trimming down a large percentage of my portfolio to sit on the sidelines. I.E I had up to 50% of my cash worth in my investing account, and trimmed that to about 25%

mktwol,,StockMarket,post,1617654045,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.""We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) can be an income machine for stimulus check recipients.

For example, the rollout of 5G networks should be a significant positive for AT&T. It's been a decade since the last upgrade of wireless download speeds, which suggests that consumers and businesses will be jumping at the prospect of updating their wireless devices. Since AT&T generates its juiciest margins from wireless data, an increase in download speeds can only improve its operating margins.


AT&T also stands to benefit from its push into streaming. Despite a slow start to the launch of HBO Max in late May, AT&T's subscriber numbers have picked up significantly in recent months. This may have to do with subsidiary WarnerMedia releasing all of its movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they'll hit theaters.","['CMCSA', 'AMP']"

I am researching the recent insiders' trading of a Canadian company listed on TSX using the Canadian Insider website. Not being a finance/accounting person, I do not understand some of the terminology used and how to interpret some of the figures presented.

So for the stock I am looking at, there are the following entries for the director of the company recently:

So has the director of the company recently bought 15792 shares and sold 38703 and 121334 shares (which seems to be a negative sign for the stock)?

Could anyone explain to me the meaning of ""Exercise of third party derivative"" and ""Redemption, retraction, cancellation, repurchase"" in this context?

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is dutchy corps [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

There's basically no way to sell a covered call, either, so, all calls are naked by default, and exercising them just withdraws the funds from the seller's account (which are presumably held as affected buying power, anyway)

I'm not exactly sure what a MM does to hedge their bets here, but I'm guessing it has to do with spreading out their sales across a long enough period that a single spike isn't going to devastate them.  VIX usually jumps up for very short periods of time.

Kodak  received $310 MM new capital in Feb 2021. The company announced they  will grow into a pharma company. KODK may spike to $60.

    Private Equity (PE)/Venture Capital (VC) investments in pharmaceutical  companies have grown by more than 3.5 times in 2020 and for the first  time crossed $1 billion to touch $1.69 billion during January to  September 2020.  According to experts, the industry enjoys respect and enduring  relationships among investors on the back of good exits. Fund managers  said investors remained positive on the pharma manufacturing activity in  India, which further strengthened during the Covid-19 period, on  account of restrictions imposed on pharma imports from China.

mkqgj9,,StockMarket,post,1617644883,"How will a reverse split affect options?Hi there,

New to options trading  and I was wondering how a reverse split would affect this? 

As an example, let's say I have options on a call with a strike price set to $10 and the stock is currently sitting at $5. For some reason the company decides to run a reverse split on their stock. If the reverse split happens so that the stock value is now at $10, how would this affect the option? Will the option always be corrected for this?

Any help would be appreciated. Let me know whether this is making any sense or not. Like I said, I'm new to options trading so the ""lingo"" might be off.

CECORS, INC. (OTC PINK: CEOS) (""CeCors"" or the ""Company""), is pleased to announce that the Company is transitioning into the Psychedelics Market, with a direction that includes a complete overhaul of the management team, bringing the Company to current status and delivering exciting growth for our shareholders.

**The newly appointed management of PsyKey Inc. will oversee operations of CeCors as we look ahead to build a viable, sustainable, and innovative company that will become a category leader as psychedelics become legal in more and more jurisdictions.** The previous officers and/or directors no longer have any relationship with CeCors, and we wish them well in their future endeavors. The Company has begun the process of becoming current in its reporting obligations with the OTC Markets, beginning with financials, completing a successful audit, and updating new director biographies accordingly.

The Acquisition Agreement between the two companies allows CeCors to purchase all outstanding shares of PsyKey Inc., a Canadian federal corporation. PsyKey Inc. will operate as a wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary of CeCors until the Company achieves current status with OTC Markets. At that point, they will look to a name change to PsyKey World. The Company has completed an Authorized Share increase of 250 million shares, for a total of 500 million Authorized Shares in order to accommodate for the acquisition. There are no outstanding convertible notes, and all shares issued in consideration for the purchase of PsyKey Inc. will be subject to standard regulatory restriction periods.",

I'm apart of a research group working on a project about financial transparency and how Gamestop shook it up, particularly on the retail side of things. We've put together a quick, anonymous survey that we will use to gauge sentiment on reddit, get some statistics, and have a better picture of what happened from different perspectives. We may use some direct quotes but of course they will be anonymous.

To be clear:  We have no position in this issue nor an underlying motive. We're just trying to put together a little paper analyzing Gamestop through a certain academic lens. Unfortunately we can't provide a reward or anything for filling out the survey, but if you're feeling generous with your time we would be super grateful to hear from you!

 Do I have an extra month to pay my taxes?

Yes. The May 17 deadline is for both payments and filing returns.

###### Who does the delay apply to?

The delay applies to individuals filing Forms 1040 and 1040-SR. It doesn’t affect deadlines for corporate, partnership or nonprofit tax returns.

###### What about first-quarter estimated tax payments?

The postponement doesn’t apply to first-quarter estimated tax payments for 2021. The deadline for them remains April 15. On March 29, the IRS reaffirmed the April 15 deadline.

###### Do I need to take any action for the delay to apply to me?

No. The extension is automatic for individual taxpayers. The agency says there is no need to call the IRS or file a form to qualify for this extension.

###### Does the May 17 deadline apply to contributions for 2020 traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and HSAs?

Yes, it does. This issue had been unclear, but on March 29 the IRS issued Notice 2021-21, which postpones to May 17 the April 15 deadline for 2020 contributions to these accounts.

 What about state tax deadlines?

“We expect most states to conform their deadlines with the new federal deadlines,” says Mary Peterson, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, a state-tax group.

I collect all the posts and analysis from Reddit day by day:

On Monday:

[Earning release](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgeno4/aso_earnings_release/), and it’s “$1.09 vs the expected $0.56” 

[It pretty much doubles its expected earnings.](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Academy+Sports+and+Outdoor+%28ASO%29+Tops+Q4+EPS+by+57c%2C+Revenues+Beat%3B+Offers+FY21+EPS+Guidance+Below+Consensus/18193794.html)

And remember -- it is one of the most shorted stock, and we are going to see a very interesting move today probably.

On Wednesday:

[As I mentioned 2 days ago](https://www.chatanalytic.com/post/daily-analysis), ASO got a lot of attention when it beat its earnings. People are excited today because they expect there might be a squeeze for this heavily shorted stock.

Watch out for possible moves before April 16h.

On Friday:

Guess what? People are getting more interested in discussing ASO because it beats the earning, has tons of cash, and is heavily shorted. People on Reddit believe there could be a great upside because “[Short interest is at 39%, public float is 31M and market cap is 2B, 9.1 days to cover](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi2oum/aso_and_why_you_apes_are_gonna_be_mad_you_missed/)”. There could be [a major break before Friday next week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi73g6/im_betting_on_aso_heading_for_a_major_breakout/). And here is [a potential for a gamma squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi07tr/dd_aso_options_ladder_is_enticing_high_short/). People approve of this, and they are in.

Good morning Traders, Markets reopen to new levels and volatility shows the trouble can has been kicked down the road for now ... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things...[Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 4 5 21](https://youtu.be/RtQpFWSZScI) 

📷

Markets reopen to new levels and volatility shows the trouble can has been kicked down the road for now. With futures being open on Friday but equities being close how will things shake out in the new week. The first thing that caught my attention was the volatility can has been kicked down the rd. The Volatility curve seems to have normalized with fear now put off to June and beyond. With this being the beginning of the month, I usually look for continuation to the upside in the form of a lopsided range day type structure on the second trading day of the month. So, with the actual equites open for business today and futures already having jumped on Friday I look for a little equalization in the form of consolidation before decision to continue higher. Let's get into today's outcomes: 1) we hold support at 401area, which opens a path to 405 after a little consolidation between 401 and 403 area. 2) We have a trend day up type day. We try to fill the gap by retesting but not making all the way back too 400, then a straight up toward 405 area. 3) we break below 401, opening a path to 398. Look to short retest pushes back toward 400. 

1) we hold support at 401area, which opens a path to 405 after a little consolidation between 401 and 403 area. **40% probability** 

2) We have a trend day up type day. We try to fill the gap by retesting but not making all the way back too 400, then a straight up toward 405 area. **35% probability** 

3) we break below 401, opening a path to 398. Look to short retest pushes back toward 400. **25% probability**",['GPS']

mka3zb,,StockMarket,post,1617587787,"Long term gains SaleHello, 

I'm trying to sell my Delta shares in order to fund my new investment, Delta was a huge win for me, buying in last year however now I have a different stock in mind that I think will perform better than Delta from current position, not that anyone asked but it's Icahn Enterprises, however I want to make sure that every stock I sell will fall under long term gains for me.

So I have been buying Delta since March 2020, By April 4th, 2020, I've had 25 shares, so it has been a year since I have held them. I kept on buying until September 2020, 450 shares total, except for one occasion where I sold 40 shares on May 18th. 

So to keep long story short, if I were to sell let's say 25 Delta shares tomorrow, will they be taxed as long term gains for me since by this point last year I already had 25 shares, or would the fact that I sold 40 shares in May 2020 would have already sold those oldest owned shares I've had, and I'd have to wait for the next date when I've had more that 40 shares last year?

 I am using Robinhood by the way if this differs between brokers.

&#x200B;

This was in back of my mind for a while now, since I knew soon would be a year since many of my purchases occurred, so would be grateful for the insight.

Honestly this seems like a pretty big issue that should really be tracked on the app, showing short term vs long term shares, in my case I'll be taxed at 22% instead of 15% because of a few days.

- so you sold 40 shares in 5/2020, so you just have to backtrack and go look at your history. So those 40 shares would have been the first 40 in your lot that got sold. 
- so your original 25 are sold based on what you are saying. 
- to keep it simple, just wait until 9/2020 to avoid any confusion. Or you can take a look at purchase history and no. Of  share that you bought totals more than 40 by today then they ate long term for you.",

How DeFi Is Being Used Now

DeFI is making its way into a wide variety of simple and complex financial transactions. It’s powered by decentralized apps called “dapps,” or other programs called “protocols.” Dapps and protocols handle transactions in the two main cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
While Bitcoin is the more popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum is much more adaptable to a wider variety of uses, meaning much of the dapp and protocol landscape uses Ethereum-based code.
Here are some of the ways dapps and protocols are already being used:

Traditional financial transactions. Anything from payments, trading securities and insurance, to lending and borrowing are already happening with DeFi.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Right now, most cryptocurrency investors use centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini. DEXs facilitate peer-to-peer financial transactions and let users retain control over their money.

E-wallets. DeFi developers are creating digital wallets that can operate independently of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and give investors access to everything from cryptocurrency to blockchain-based games.

Stable coins. While cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, stable coins attempt to stabilize their values by tying them to non-cryptocurrencies, like the U.S. dollar.

Yield harvesting. Dubbed the “rocket fuel” of crypto, DeFi makes it possible for speculative investors to lend crypto and potentially reap big rewards when the proprietary coins DeFi borrowing platforms pay them for agreeing to the loan appreciate rapidly.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs create digital assets out of typically non-tradable assets, like videos of slam dunks or the first tweet on Twitter. NFTs commodify the previously uncommodifiable.

Flash loans. These are cryptocurrency loans that borrow and repay funds in the same transaction. Sound counterintuitive? Here’s how it works: Borrowers have the potential to make money by entering into a contract encoded on the Ethereum blockchain—no lawyers needed—that borrows funds, executes a transaction and repays the loan instantly. If the transaction can’t be executed, or it’ll be at a loss, the funds automatically go back to the loaner. If you do make a profit, you can pocket it, minus any interest charges or fees. Think of flash loans as decentralized arbitrage.

The DeFi market gauges adoption by measuring what’s called locked value, which calculates how much money is currently working in different DeFi protocols. At present, the total locked value in DeFi protocols is nearly $43 billion.
Adoption of DeFi is powered by the omnipresent nature of blockchain: The same moment a dapp is encoded on the blockchain, it’s globally available. While most centralized financial instruments and technologies roll out slowly over time, governed by the respective rules and regulations of regional economies, dapps exist outside of these rules, increasing their potential reward—and also increasing their risks.

Risks and Downsides of DeFi

DeFi is an emerging phenomenon that comes with many risks. As a recent innovation, decentralized finance has not been stress tested by long or widespread use. In addition, national authorities are taking a harder look at the systems it’s putting in place, with an eye toward regulation. Some of the other risks of DeFi include:

No consumer protections. DeFi has thrived in the absence of rules and regulations. But this also means users may have little recourse should a transaction go foul. In centralized finance, for instance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) reimburses deposit account holders up to $250,000 per account, per institution if a bank fails. Moreover, banks are required by law to hold a certain amount of their capital as reserves, to maintain stability and cash you out of your account any time you need. No similar protections exist in DeFi.

Hackers are a threat. While a blockchain may be nearly impossible to alter, other aspects of DeFi are at large risk of being hacked, which can lead to funds theft or loss. All of decentralized finance’s potential use cases rely on software systems that are vulnerable to hackers.

Collateralization. Collateral is a thing of value used to secure a loan. When you get a mortgage, for instance, the loan is collateralized by the home you’re buying. Nearly all DeFi lending transactions require collateral equal to at least 100% of the value of the loan, if not more. These requirements vastly restrict who is eligible for many types of DeFi loans.

Private key requirements. With DeFi and cryptocurrency, you must secure the wallets used to store your cryptocurrency assets. Wallets are secured with private keys, which are long, unique codes known only to the owner of the wallet. If you lose a private key, you lose access to your funds—there is no way to recover a lost private key.

How to Get Involved with DeFi

If you’d like to learn more about DeFi in a hands-on way, here are a few ways to get started:

Get a Crypto Wallet

“Start by setting up an Ethereum wallet like Metamask, then funding it with Ethereum,” says Cosman. “Self-custody wallets are your ticket to the world of DeFi, but make sure to save your public and private key. Lose these, and you won’t be able to get back into your wallet.”

Trade Digital Assets.

“I recommend trading a small amount of two assets on a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap,” says Doug Schwenk, chairman of Digital Asset Research. “Trying this exercise will help a crypto enthusiast understand the current landscape, but be prepared to lose everything while you’re learning which assets and platforms are best and how to manage risks.”

Look into Stablecoins

“An exciting way to try out DeFi without exposing oneself to the price swings of an underlying asset is to try out TrueFi, which offers competitive returns on stablecoins (AKA dollar-backed tokens, which aren’t subject to price movements),” Cosman says.
The key to any foray into a new financial space is to start slow, stay humble and don’t get ahead of yourself. Keep in mind that digital assets traded in the cryptocurrency and DeFi worlds are fast-moving and there’s significant potential for loss.

The Future of DeFi

From taking out the middleman to turning basketball clips into digital assets with monetary value, DeFi’s future looks bright. That’s why people like Dan Simerman, head of financial relations at IOTA Foundation, a DeFi research and development group, see both the promise and potential of DeFi as far-reaching, even though it’s still in the infancy of its capabilities.
Investors will soon have more independence, which will allow them to “deploy [assets] in creative ways that seem impossible today,” Simerman says. DeFi also carries big implications for the big data sector as it matures to enable new ways to commodify data, Simerman says.

But for all its promise, DeFi has a long road ahead, especially when it comes to uptake by the general public.
“The promise is there,” says Simerman. “It’s up to us to continue educating people about the potential, but we also need to keep working hard to build the tools that will allow people to see it for themselves.”

mjo72o,,StockMarket,post,1617507470,"ET DD I did today for a discord I’m in.   This is a DD I wrote for my friends and I discord, thought I’d share.

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

Does it decline if the S&P is less volatile than usual, or does it decline when the S&P is simply not volatile? They sound similar I’m just having trouble wording it.

I’m just a bit confused, because if it keeps up at the same pace, it seems as though it could be sub $5 within a few months. Is that actually feasible?

Buffett made a famous bet that hedge funds would underperform the market over a 10-year stretch, which he won, but he's also famous for overperforming the index (on average) for decades. The standard argument is that if you take the S&P500, remove the companies that you think are worst (poor management, obsolete business model, etc.), and if you're not charging yourself fees, you could stand a decent chance of beating the market. As long as you have the temperament. 

In the real world people's emotions get the better of them, and they end up buying high and selling low. A classic example is the Magellan Fund--the fund itself grew at 30% per year, but the average investor in the fund lost money, because they weren't able to control their emotions.",['SPGI']

mlcol4,,wallstreetbets,post,1617718653,"Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested!By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. 
 
&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. 
 
&nbsp;
  
Ok, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. 
 
&nbsp;
 
**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**
 
&nbsp;
 
Hedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: 
 
1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. 
  
2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  
 
&nbsp;

 
Retailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. 
   
&nbsp;

Let's look at the short interest over time for ASO: 
 
&nbsp;

|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|
|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|
|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|
|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|
|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|

&nbsp;

We can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. 
 
&nbsp;

Most shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. 

&nbsp;

Some may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, 
&nbsp;


>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.
&nbsp;


So, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. 

&nbsp;
 
**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**

&nbsp;
 
[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  
 
&nbsp;

Did someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: 
 
&nbsp;

|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|
--:|:--|:--|
|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|
|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|
|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|
|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|
|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|

&nbsp;
 
Price at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. 
 
&nbsp;

Let's see that in a table: 

|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||
:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||
|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||
|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||
|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||
|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||
|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||

&nbsp;
 
Now, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. 

&nbsp;

 
|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|
--:|--:|--:|--:|
|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|
|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|
|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|
|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|
 
&nbsp;
 
I'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. 
  
&nbsp;

**Indicators** 
 
I don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) ""crossing over"" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). 

&nbsp;
 
**Conclusion** 
&nbsp;

For me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store.

Thanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.


&nbsp;

Positions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.
 
&nbsp;

Edit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps ""gapping up"", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.

 
&nbsp;

Edit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30. Will assume that is the floor for now.",['GPS']

mlfhvd,,wallstreetbets,post,1617726231,"Building off the post from yesterday, I built a dashboard that tracks congressmen’s returns from stock trading over time. You can use it to see who’s a fellow member of WSB and who’s actually making money.[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.

[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)

A while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I’ll copy that below:

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.","['GE', 'AMD', 'SPGI', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'MU']"

“This allows industrial customers whose capital assets are equipped with thousands of sensors each — such as airplanes, oil wells, and manufacturing plants — to stream and ingest millions of new data points per second.”

Any company in any data-driven industry can benefit from PLTR software.

To all the “and the stock will drop on good news...always does” Debbie Downers...

PLTR is just getting started...big insider selling headwinds...will diminish in a few months.

PLTR’s capabilities have been developed over the past decade with DOD/DARPA support.

Name one software company that can challenge PLTR for Big Data analytics.

If I was the CTO/CIO of a F500 company I’d definitely want to see what PLTR could do for my company.

ml8wrq,,wallstreetbets,post,1617706339,"Walmart SetupHi guys,

This is my first post here, so if there are some aspects not to your liking, please let me know.

I am a pattern trader, and today I noticed a double bottom forming and other entry signals on Walmart (WMT) :

Here is an overview of the situation and the move I will be making on it when I get confirmation:

**The catalysts :**

* Double bottom pattern
* 50 day moving average (MA) breakout.

Now, when there is more than one signal forming on a single stock, the probability of the trade going your way is much higher than when there is just one signal.

**The play**

Today I will wait for confirmation of the breakout (the stock trades higher than yesterday's close) and I will enter using the following **setup:**

**Entry price :** 140$ (breakout confirmation)

**Stop loss :** 137.5$ ( half way through yesterday's bar - breakout failure - setup not valid anymore)

**Risk :** 2.5$/sh

**Target :** 147.5$ ( the next resistance level, also the target level of the double bottom)

**Profit :** 7.5$/sh

**Risk/reward :** 3:1

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Screenshot**

**TLDR:**

**Enter:** 140$

**Set Stop loss :** 137.5$

**Set limit sell:** 147.5$

&#x200B;

**Edit :** some are complaining that the short interest data is wrong. I edited it out , but it's ok, this setup is not dependent on a squeeze happening for it to succeed.

Have now been sober for over two months and this sub has changed my life in the processAs I mentioned [over two months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2wx2p/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gkfnqqi/?context=3https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2wx2p/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gkfnqqi/?context=3), I was going to rehab holding GME, and I checked in on Jan 25th. During the first couple of days, I was seeing you all on TV and it really made my days. I was so proud of this sub. Before leaving, I had set my limit orders and then didn't have any computer access until January 29th.

In the meantime, most of my limit orders hit. When I finally got computer access on the 29th for five mins, I sold the rest of my holding.

I've now been completely sober for over two months for the first time since my early teens. For a while I had wanted to do something special for my parents as they're getting older. With this GME money I was able to buy them a car, straight cash.

**Now that I'm back, only one question remains. What is the next YOLO?!**

mkk7u7,gtgg1y8,wallstreetbets,comment,1617632738,"Congrats on the recovery dude. You should know, the rate of co-morbid substance and gambling addiction is incredibly high. “The next YOLO” definitely doesn’t sound like healthy and thoughtful investing. And while I know everyone shits on that here, your buying pattern on GME wasn’t a YOLO, it was a thoughtful strategy that you leveled into and sold thoughtfully. Don’t let the rush of a huge win make you into a gambling addict now that you don’t have the rush for drugs. **Think seriously about joining the theta gang** now that you’ve got the capital to do so, especially in this market condition. 

Again, congrats on the recovery. It’s a hard fought win and don’t take your eye off the ball.

It all started last year in February of 2020 right when the pandemic was really starting to batter the U.S. 

I was playing some 5/5/15 PLO at my buddies game, when my friend who we all just call “milk man” began to open his stupid mouth about how “this and that” is going to send the price of sweet cream butter skyrocketing because of some bullshit about how grocery stores will be understocked and Martha will need a fuck ton of sweet cream butter to feed the family while everyone’s stuck at home. We all call him milk man because he’s literally a cow milker, has a big farm, and always wears this hat with a cow on it. 

I use derogatory language when regarding milk man now, but then, his stack was tall and mine was short. I was tilted and also drunk when something in me clicked and said “this is it. butter futures is the yolo that will make me rich.” I was working a great job in finance at the time and had some capital to work with.

I listened to milk man go on and on about butter for the rest of the night. The next morning, Monday. I yolo’d into CME cash-settled butter futures expiring March 15th, 2020. Naive me at the time thought COVID would be over with within a couple of months.

Then it all went to fucking shit. 

So supposedly I didn’t yolo into sweet cream butter futures but I just flat out yolod into butter futures. I honestly didn’t even know what the fuck I was doing but I just figured all butter was going up crazy so it didn’t matter. Well I was dead wrong. 

These fucking worthless dairy farmers couldn’t keep up with the demand so they began to either put palm oil into the butter or the fed the cows too much palm oil to the point that it got into the butter. I’m still not sure what they did, but it doesn’t matter. Half of god damn Canada was complaining that their butter is rock solid at room temperature. How the fuck do you expect them to spread it on toast? It was a disaster. Butter tanked. I was ruined. 

Fast forward a year later and looking back it’s all not so bad. I have a really steady job now and the pay is pretty good. The only downside is every time I’m milking cows on milk mans farm he says the same dumb joke every time. 

“Make sure that’s sweet cream milk and not regular milk!”

Fucking dick. Sweet cream futures thrived. Up nearly 20% since February 2020.",['CME']

mkhdou,gtfy0k4,wallstreetbets,comment,1617622062,"In their filing with the SEC, you can see them say “we filed something identical to this in December, and didn’t sell any shares through the program.”  It’s the equivalent of putting in an application to trade options (if it had to be renewed every 4 months) - it doesn’t mean you’re trading them already, just that you can if you want to.

Woke up to the news, did some due diligence, but this form of stock sale potential will allow GameStop, if they want, to slowly sell securities to raise money.  They won’t do it all at once, because it’s not in their interest to promote panic, (no panic or price drop is  the purpose of this type of offering, versus a bulk sale, new share issuance, etc)

Minus that minor morning heart attack I’m extremely bullish on the company and the squeeze.  Almost thought it was a major dilution or something dumb af based on the headlines.

Edit:  Here’s the prospectus from the SEC if you want to see, bullet point 2 shows that no sales were made on the last version of this.  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm#supprom160986_12

mlc389,,wallstreetbets,post,1617716996,"The Billy Hwang Gang Bang and Why I Am Still Balls Deep In $VIACAIn a [previous post from last Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhp1fe/spongebob_vs_hwang_gang_and_the_banks/), I outlined why I thought $VIACA would moon like $DISCB. I bought the calls, envisioned the massive money I was going to make, and was promptly kicked in the dick. I am ride or die so you can bet your ass I am still in the trade.

The premise was that the big banks that were holding the Billy Hwang’s Archegos’ bag, most notably Credit Suisse and Nomura, were about done with selling. As it turns out, the risk management department at Credit Suisse is more retarded than I thought, and Monday’s trading was still filled with lots more selling.

**What changed**

In the afterhours last night, Credit Suisse showed just how shit their risk management department is by revealing that they only managed to sell 3m of its 37m $VIACA/$VIAC shares over the course of a week. Credit Suisse is running/ran a sale process in the afterhours tonight to [get out of their remaining 34m shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/credit-suisse-said-to-offer-viacomcbs-vipshop-farfetch-blocks). I speculate Credit Suisse’s large, unmoved block of shares was an open secret around the Street and inspired traders to keep pressing shorts until Credit Suisse visibly raised the white flag. Well, we know Credit Suisse has now folded.

With the Credit Suisse selling out of the way, I am guessing that there will be a lot of short covering and rebuys coming in the next week or so to conclude the trade on the short side. My preferred way to play Viacom is with $VIACA for the same reason $DISCB was the way to play Discovery. I believe $VIACA is now primed for takeoff and will probably buy more tomorrow because I am a degenerate.

**TL;DR**

VIACA 4/16 $50c, $60c, $65c, and $70c

Most options expire worthless and these probably will too.","['MMM', 'VIAC']"

**DESCRIPTION**  

 Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that *designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions* for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for *corporate, public, & residential customers*. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

 **History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for ***72% market share of total level 2*** charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with SBE (via Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle) late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (network subscriptions & equipment) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

· Market Cap: **$6.99bn** 

· Shares Float \~ 300mln

· ***Short Interest \~70%***, per latest short numbers the short interest is **85%**, but it's an old figure, which might have dissipated as price fell from ATH $49.48, an update due later this month.

· Institutional ownership **\~5%**

· **2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;**

· **TAM $190bn**

· No Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents \~$650m. Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with  
 41% Gross Margin.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) certainly shows that they have the largest market share at 42.8K Level 2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", giving $CHPT \~53% of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of Level 3 '*Superchargers*', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, Level 2, \~75% and Level 1, \~3% of market share.

**Challengers**

· $VLTA (SNPR) Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The only things they don't do are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s and 6 DCFCs I wouldn't put too much stock in that. It's basically chargers-as-billboards, selected to boutique locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it.*

· SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of Level 2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers, offers warranties and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a DCFC offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).

· $EVGO(CLII): EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW DCFCs, and DCFCs are their game. AFDC data says they only have 403 Level 2s but 1.4k DCFCs which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (looks like 0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer DCFCs. They also have a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the DCFC focus.

· $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells Level 2 and DCFC chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:  
 *""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""* 

· $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): DCFC focused company, it enjoys 2.5k DCFCs. EM also sells a Level 2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts** 

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: *""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""*

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical now how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, *former $CHPT board member is in current administration.*

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans   
 \- Transit electrification dates   
 \- Incentive programs   
 \- All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating - 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st. 

**MOAT**

· First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)

· Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)

· Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)

· Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology

Why am I interested in $CHPT?

Is because it entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry?

Is because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now

**And** is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Is it because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum? + ESG and inevitable supremacy and prevalence?

Is it a small market cap in the market that will ***explode no matter what?***

*That’s* ***bananas*** but not the main reason. The main reason is high short interest well over 50% which can be taken advantage of like an ape should. That's first way of making money on $CHPT. The second way, after squeeze should squoze, this is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~5% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - **bananas.**

**This is not a financial advice, do your own research.**

mkt7qi,,wallstreetbets,post,1617652200,"The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against AmericaDisclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.

Disclosure: RIDE stock will triple by September. 🚀🚀🚀 Do what you will with this information.

I hadn’t posted on reddit until recently when [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report. 

Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down. 

And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:

1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.

2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.

Okay, let’s get started.

&#x200B;

**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**

Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”*

“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.

&#x200B;

**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**

I’m from Ohio, and about 2 years ago now, I saw [over 1500 people in our small community lose their jobs when GM closed their state-of-the-art facility](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gut-wrenching-day-ohio-gm-assembly-plant-prepares-close-n980136). Words couldn’t accurately portray the amount of hurt and pain that hit Ohio as a result of this. 

But a couple of months later, I heard about LMC. I heard GM was going to invest in LMC in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). I then had a couple of friends get hired there who told me they were getting a jump start in the EV industry with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). Keep in mind, this was 2019, so large-scale production of EV’s was a relatively new concept. 

Nonetheless, this was exactly what our community needed – some hope and excitement. American-made electric vehicles in small-town Ohio – helping create a more sustainable future and adding thousands of jobs in our country. Plus, this was a massive opportunity, as the [global light duty vehicle market is now valued at \~ $600B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market).

Fast forward 2 years, and [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all). 

&#x200B;

**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**

I will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**

Hindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.

Well, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.

The betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**

Well, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report. 

Ultimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.

To address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/). This is huge for LMC to have their battery supplier as a next-door neighbor.

Btw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx). 

Plans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV. 🚀 🚀 🚀

This claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders** 

First and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.

This is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.

Additionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.

Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period. 

&#x200B;

**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**

Lordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.

Developing these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

Sure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.

LMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.

LMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).

u/DrReginaldWexley owns and operates his own small fleet of vehicles. I found [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/md063x/the_transition_is_real_its_happening_now_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I thought was useful to learn more from a customer’s perspective.

&#x200B;

**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**

I decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did? 

What I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”

&#x200B;

**Why is this finding significant?**

Well, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.

Think about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.

I would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.

&#x200B;

**Proof of Concept for LMC’s Endurance truck**

LMC is showing their level of confidence in their vehicle by enrolling in [one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd) – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17. Get your popcorn ready, this **major catalyst is now less than 2 weeks away** and will be publicly televised. 🚀 🚀 🚀

LMC is also in the [final due diligence phase for the ATVM loan](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which could be announced any day now. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means there has been substantial digging into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring.

Sure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.

&#x200B;

**Brief Technical Overview**

From a technical perspective, the chart shows that this same downward movement has happened multiple times in the past 6 months, and each time, the stock has (quickly) rebounded back to $30. Violent moves downward are frequently followed by violent moves upward in these low-float, volatile stocks. 

I recently saw some extremely detailed [technical analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/me2bro/weve_all_heard_the_fundamentals_for_a_bull_case/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this stock for if you’re more of a trader than an investor. For folks who trade stocks based on indicators, the [recent Beta release](https://www.truckinginfo.com/10140497/lordstown-unveils-two-betas-of-endurance-pickup) could be the catalyst we needed to begin an upward trend back towards $30 and beyond. 🚀 🚀 🚀

&#x200B;

**Position:**

1500 shares that I will be holding onto for several years, and a few October calls for once they are pumping out trucks this fall 🚀🚀🚀

I’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.9B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story. It’s a damn shame that Hindenburg wrongfully attacked a company in small-town Ohio that is bringing 1000’s of jobs to our country. My advice to Hindenburg: Never bet against America.

I RIDE with Lordstown. #WorkForIt #MadeInAmerica

When this stock hits $150 in a few years, we’re all going on a RIDE to Vegas to celebrate. 🚀🚀🚀","['UPS', 'GM', 'TSLA', 'NDAQ', 'TWTR']"
mkt7qi,gths6ek,wallstreetbets,comment,1617654735,"**Also, as I mentioned in my post, here is a $TSLA example on how Wall Street capitalizes on FUD from SEC involvement:**

In the summer of 2019, a “highly regarded” analyst at Morgan Stanley named Adam Jonas came out with a (pre-split) [worst-case price target of $10 for Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html). This was right around the time Tesla was being looked at by the SEC.

When the news of this broke, one of my friends I roomed with in college told me he made the decision to sell the stock. He was new to the market, and he was worried he was going to lose all of his money on this investment. I’m sure many other retail investors made the same decision to sell as Wall Street succeeded by inducing fear into $TSLA investors.

**A year and a half later, how much $TSLA does Morgan Stanley own?**

[Morgan Stanley now owns over 3.5 million shares of Tesla which equates to over $2.5 Billion dollars](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/morgan-stanley). 

And guess what? That same Morgan Stanley analyst, [Adam Jonas, now has a Wall-Street high price target of $810](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/morgan-stanleys-adam-jonas-raises-tesla-price-target-to-a-wall-street-high-of-810.html) (which would equate to over $4,000 before the stock split).

Must be nice – lower your price target to scare retail investors, load up on the stock when the price drops, and then increase your price target to drive the stock way up. 

Wall Street does this all the time, and this is the reason we despise these crooks.","['TSLA', 'MS']"

I was into Aphria, the pot company, when Hindenburg Research called them a ""shell game"" and released a lengthy report which turned out to be pretty dubious as well. I doubled my position then on the dip after reading their report and was rewarded nicely when the facts came out. I think any shorts report is incredibly self serving and probably skirts on the edge of libel in a lot of cases.

The big difference between LMC and Nikola is these guys actually have a product, they are producing them. As well, having LOI for 100k fleet vehicles means a lot more than the 8 billion in pre-orders Nikola had that you could order on their website without giving ANY information whatsoever.

Similarly, US comp Doordash lost 40% between mid February to mid March. Comparing the two:

**Doordash** (**$DASH**)

* 2020 revenue: $2.9 billion
* 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 226%
* Market cap: $42 billion
* Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 14.5x

**Deliveroo** (**$ROO**)

* 2020 revenue: £1.2 billion
* 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 54.3%
* Market cap: £5.6 billion
* Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 4.7x

So Doordash is trading at 3x the multiple that Deliveroo is trading at, with 4x the growth rate. Also, Doordash is the dominant player in a much larger market. Looks like a pair-trade.

mkljmv,,wallstreetbets,post,1617631731,"AMD Increasing Production by 20% in Q2, buy before earnings!Remember that there is no chip shortage. It's a chip demand. AMD is making more chips than they ever have in their history but demand is even greater than that. For an explanation, see this on youtube /watch?v=3A4yk-P5ukY So when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su says that the chip shortage is a good thing for AMD, you can start to understand why. And also start to understand why AMD's stock can soar on earnings.

The news article on AMD increasing production in English is here:

[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/)

They're getting the information from Channel Gate, which is in Chinese. It says that AMD will increase chip supply by 20% in Q2 compared to Q1. Now, this is rumors so the market isn't making any moves based on it yet, but it's likely that this means AMD is increasing chip production by 20% in Q2 relative to Q1. This follows Dr. Lisa Su saying that they are working on ways of increasing production to meet demand in an interview with Cramer a few weeks ago. You can find that interview on youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc So the rumor is likely true here.

Because AMD is selling everything they make, the increase in production will translate directly into an increase in earnings. Therefor, I expect AMD to make the official announcement of the increase in production along side a revised earnings expectation for the year in the next earnings report. In this market, you can't just beat earnings, you have to increase earnings expectations going forward, and that's what I believe will happen with the increase in production.

Another, unrelated positive for the company is that, due to retailers jacking up prices on AMD products, AMD has started to sell more and more of their products directly from their own store, cutting out the middle man. [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us) They're doing this to ""ensure gamers can get AMD products at MSRP"" But really it means AMD is making an extra 20% off each chip. Brilliant.

I've been posting over the last month that I believe AMD is going to $120 and the jump will happen within the next 3 months. I still think this is true.

mkljmv,gtgggtm,wallstreetbets,comment,1617632945,"It is funny that AMD used to be this subreddit's darling yet very rarely we see anything AMD make front page. The bullish thesis on AMD is unbelievably strong. AMD is doing 50% revenue growth WITH chip shortages. Margins are growing rapidly and market share as well. AMD is entering new industries and new partnerships rapidly. Lisa SU has conservatively guided another 40% this year but with their usual beats this will be another 50%+ year, if chip shortages resolve could be 60-70%. Tesla AMD partnership has yet to be officially announced. It is likely waiting for the vote on AMD's Xlinix acquisition to be completed before they formally announce it.

AMD currently has P/E of 40 ..... for a company jumping 50% revenue a year. The stock price is heavily weighed down this past 6 months from Xlinix acquisition (which is done through stock sale giving XLNX holders a fixed AMD stock amount). Once Xlinix acquisition is completed and chip shortages are resolved, this rocket ship will take off and likely stock will jump 50% in a matter of months.","['XLNX', 'TSLA', 'AMD']"

"" Liu also confirmed for the first time that there is a serious ""double-booking"" effect in the industry, in which clients place orders for more chips than they actually intend to use.

I think this should be added to the equation before betting on one of TSMCs largest clients.

Their margins are historically pretty low, so they carry lots of debt. 100 year old company that decided last October was the time to go public. Wonder why? It's so they could put their two best quarters ever (by 150%) on the 10q, the stock would go up, and the insiders/execs could cash a bunch out of the business to ""dumb"" public markets instead of shark private equity if they hadn't gone public.

They are using the $200,000,000 from the IPO to pay down debt and update stores. They're not using it to a bunch of new stores. They have too much debt and their margins are too low to go on a big growth spurt.

They typically net $120,000,000 a year on 260 stores, be careful. This $305,000,000 year is a covid anomaly. 

Another thing to watch out for. They've got 222,000,000 rounds in the chamber in the form of shares they are authorized to issue if they so please. Don't be surprised if they go full AMC.

Can’t compare market cap to revenue — one is an equity metric and the other is a capital-structure neutral metric. (For companies with significant debt this becomes a bigger issue.)

Run rating Q2 revenue only works if there’s no seasonality and/out an outsized quarter for exogenous reasons.

Biggest thing: Revenue divided by shares is not equal to share price. Market cap divided by shares is the only way to get there. You can determine what you think market cap should be by doing an intrinsic valuation (DCF) or a relative valuation (using a median multiple of comps or precedent transactions to build to enterprise value and then backing out net debt to get to equity value. Then dividing by shares to get to price per share.) Right now your math has no basis in reality. It’s of roughly the credibility of saying, “They sell 200k kayaks divided by selling 2.5k fishing rods = $80 fair value)”

Stock could definitely be attractive but you’re running the wrong math. Happy to provide some resources if you want to brush up, but don’t think you should be guiding people towards spending their money until you do.

If you ran those analyses the answer could very well be that ASO is undervalued...just gotta do the right work to confirm that. I generally don’t like shitting on people who are trying to learn like some people on here but I do get frustrated when folks pump stuff with factually incorrect information trying to get others to spend their/their family’s hard-earned savings.

That is not cool man/lady.

Edit: Funny enough I’ve been long ASO since IPO but probably selling soon after these outsized earnings that I view as atypical.

I would like to present to you a long-term value play, that includes short-term technical profitability as well a potential short squeeze.

# The service and Product.

&#x200B;

[General information on how SDC does business.](https://preview.redd.it/q3hif166rkr61.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b93787de857cb99c9bd688b61b65e5526a217ca)

SDC is a telehealth dental company that provides clear aligners for 1/3 the cost of $Align and mom and pop orthodontists. SDC has developed a vertical integration system where the customer has the ability to work with them in a couple of different ways.

&#x200B;

1.) Work solely through SDC where they scan their teeth at home or in one of their dental offices where the scan is sent back to the production facility for their aligners. The aligners are molded and shipped directly to the consumer thus cutting out the middleman and overhead.

2.) Work with an in-network orthodontist and have the orthodontist submit the information to SDC and the same process is completed at a fraction of the cost.

The consumer then has regular checkups as they begin adjusting their teeth with an easy in-person meeting or call over the phone.

# Partnerships and contracts.

1.) SDC has developed partnerships with major insurance companies from blue shield to MetLife thus helping customers have little to no cost.

2.) They have also developed a payment plan to help customers who do not have dental insurance to afford the payments.

3.) SDC has developed partnerships with major network orthodontists and dentists across the United States and other countries. Dentists get paid for their time and a referral fee for having SDC recommended.

4.) Agreements with CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Sam's club to present their ancillary teeth whitening product line that is normally given as a bonus to those who pay for the teeth straightening kit. This promotes brand awareness because they are on every shelf in America as well as a small amount of revenue.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals

SDC IPO'd just before covid and suffered as many other companies did during that time. Since then they have been growing QOQ, paying off high-interest debt by securing 0% convertible notes, bringing on power marketing players to the board of directors, and soon will be increasing their gross margins by \~10%.

&#x200B;

1.) QOQ growth.

[During a pandemic, a discretionary income product and service was able to create QOQ growth.](https://preview.redd.it/hc639k7uskr61.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc848aa4163d3b0aae464f732452ae4e12b7fac)

As seen above SDC was affected in q2 over 2020 significantly, but was able to survive and bounce back. Now it is only a matter of time before SDC is a name in every home.

2.) Debt Paydown.

&#x200B;

[Elimination of high-interest debt with 0&#37; interest capped calls.](https://preview.redd.it/vcqjsp9gtkr61.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a578d5ffe592d4830fa43ad3336212f5ddab02)

As seen above SDC has recently been able to enter a large cash position with this convertible debt offering. This debt payoff provides a few benefits. No interest is eating away at their profits, it protects current shares holders from dilution under the lower cap of $18, and it puts SDC in a great cash position to further their expansion into international markets.

&#x200B;

3.) Marketing and New board members.

Ted Ward has recently been brought on for his expertise in marketing. You may know him from developing Geico's marketing. [https://capitolcommunicator.com/ted-ward-geico-named-one-of-10-ad-ages-power-players/](https://capitolcommunicator.com/ted-ward-geico-named-one-of-10-ad-ages-power-players/)

Also as seen below, SDC has been growing significantly QOQ with a reducing Marketing budget. They are seeing a healthy referral-derived customer base. This is only expected to increase as SDC further expands its operations.

[Less Marketing with Growth](https://preview.redd.it/hcmf03sgukr61.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3dcf5aa04e9d80470257c6d1d7ab57f01b147cd)

4.) International Expansion.

&#x200B;

[SDC has its sights focused outside of the U.S. where teeth straightening is unaffordable for most other middle-income workers. ](https://preview.redd.it/99wiosr1vkr61.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=73d76ef4c9627794b2551ee8c676f5201e58ce79)

SDC has been setting up small brick-and-mortar and pop-up locations in countries around the world. (Most recently Mexico city).

&#x200B;

# Technicals and Mechanics

&#x200B;

[1-year chart SDC](https://preview.redd.it/bzkeq05kvkr61.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6c684bf21d768232e144758cbf46cf784f45147)

&#x200B;

SDC at the current moment has been on a downward trend since February where it reached around $16. It has been consolidating since where it has met heavy support at $10. It set for an upward trend soon however the shorts have been having their way for quite some time. Essentially ""training or choo chooing"" this company.

1.) 30% short interest. That's all.

# Counter arguments. Weakness and Threats.

1.) Rivalry amongst existing competitors. SDC is up against every orthodontist in the U.S. that wants the process of getting braces or a clear aligner from $align to stay the same. This is affecting their pockets and unless SDC is able to continue building trust with orthodontists to use their product, sadly SDC will lose market share.

2.) Bargaining power of suppliers. Nonexistent because smile direct owns and operates the creation of the straighteners.

3.) Bargaining power of buyers. Yes, consumers have many different options when it comes to finding a way to straighten their teeth. However, find a company that provides the same service at the same cost as SDC. You simply cannot.

4.) The threat of substitutes. Yes, people could choose to decide, ""Hey I don't want straight teeth. It is what is on the inside that counts. He/she will choose me for my personality.""

5.) The threat of New Entrants. Non-existent. SDC holds a patent on their process. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141799/0/en/SmileDirectClub-Granted-New-Patent-for-SmileShop-Retail-Concept-and-Digital-Customer-Journey.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/08/2141799/0/en/SmileDirectClub-Granted-New-Patent-for-SmileShop-Retail-Concept-and-Digital-Customer-Journey.html)

I am long and hard. I do agree that I am not sure when this company will spike, but I am not looking to have this jump next week. Just wanted to share what I have seen over the past six months or so.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some demand for a TLDR.

\-Large Cash positions with convertible debt at 0% interest that will only be converted above the $18 share price

\- Patent on their process. Not even Align can do what SDC is doing and ALign is in the 4-500 price range

\- New Company that has 30% short interest that has been growing quarter after quarter even with covid

\- The guy who created ""So easy a caveman can do it"" is now running their show. Ted has control over their marketing. Big players are involved now.","['WMT', 'CVS']"

ml4imd,,wallstreetbets,post,1617687178,"DD on $WKHSAii to be clear this is neither a bull nor bear case for WKHS, it's just regular DD. Also I'm not putting emojis in this shit. 
 
**What does WKHS do?**
  
They make last mile delivery vans C-650 and C-1000 (these numbers denote storage capacity, not mileage or battery capacity). They have been making them for more than half a decade, whence they started by converting diesel vans into plug in hybrids. Their actual EV offering only began around 2018-2019. This is also the time they started showing off their drone delivery tech (which is not the point of this post, but it is why they are in ARKX). This is one of the only major EV companies that actually shipped (albeit very few) product.
  
**Fundamentals**
  
I don't know too much about what everyone looks for in fundamentals, and I'm absolutely garbage at reddit formatting but here's what I know. Since the financing that occurred from end of last year, they have a huge cash position and own the 250k sqft factory in OH. Their cash positions is hundreds of millions of dollars, so they are in a position to continue developing their production. This financing came from the 10% stake in Lordstown Motors, which recently put out two beta trucks and operates in the GM factory in Lordstown, OH. 
  
They came to fame when they were in the running for the USPS truck which obvs they didn't get and went to OSK, a decision which has a tonne of scrutiny on it (but probably won't change for at least another 6 months until DeJoy is ousted). 
  
They currently have a MKT cap of under 1.7B, despite having a backlog of 8000 trucks (easily 400mil worth of product). In comparison, ARRIVAL (which hasn't released anything yet) has a market cap of 9.5B, and NKLA (which has neither a factory nor a product) has a dwindling MKT cap of 5B. 
  
The stock itself follows $RIDE closely, and I'm mad bullish on $RIDE, so I expect to it at the very least take off when $RIDE takes off. Also, they have a 50% institutional holding, showing pretty solid support.
  
**Good Stuff**
  
So there is some good stuff about this company. 

1) They have shipped products - we know it's not vaporware. 
  
2) They own 10% of Lordstown Motors, which has a crazy high potential despite the hindenburg report. 
  
3) They are partnered with Hitachi to help them develop and finance the scaling of the manufacturing line. They are getting proper experience to help them build this line up. 
  
4) They developed this truck with UPS - they worked to get everything that UPS needs in a truck. 
  
5) They have a pretty high short %ge. Not enough to cause a squeeze IMO, but y'all like hearing that. 
  
6) The 10% owner of Lordstown still has some 5.5million/6million shares, and the CEO has 75% of their shares (down from around 490k to 350k). 
  
7) they are working on a holistic solution with their truck, including the drone (they've started the FAA certification to fly it)
  
**Bad Stuff** 
  
There are also reasons to be bearish on this company. 

1) They will eventually have a lot of competition. Most are 2-3 years out from making anything, but that competition will be Ford e-Transit and Mercedes Sprinters 
  
2) They are making 3 cars per day right now. They want to triple that by end of Q2. That's still 10 cars per day. that's not a lot. 
  
3) their drone solution needs some WORK. It's designed to be integrated with the truck but they haven't shown anything useful. I honestly see no reason this company should be in ARKX tbh. 
  
4) Although the CEO retained 75% of his shares, he still sold around 25%. Don't blame him, he'd been working there for at least 5 years, but it's still not nice to see. 
  
**My Opinion**
  
Based on the fact that they have a lot of strategic partnerships (namely Hitachi) and they own 10% of Lordstown motors, and how undervalued they are compared to competitors (especially those who haven't shipped anything yet) I expect them to climb up to about the $20 mark until about Q3, at which point the increased Q4 production rate should allow them to start really going past EPS rates. 
  
TLDR: WKHS is 1/5 the value of Arrival and is the only company currently shipping vans. Proceed with caution.  Maybe 2022 calls or Oct calls.

The USPS is increasingly being called on to halt and/or reverse the USPS decision. WKHS still has a chance but with or without it this company can achieve great things IF they ramp up production.

mkxprj,,wallstreetbets,post,1617664751,"XLNX Arbitrage Merger with AMD on April 7thXLNX is merging with AMD. When the merger is complete, every XLNX share will be turned into 1.7234 AMD shares.

The window for regulators to object the merger has passed. The last major hurdle for the merger is the shareholder meeting on April 7th.

Currently XLNX is trading at $130 while AMD is trading at $81. With the merger XLNX is 1.7234 * 81 = $139.6 versus $130 (current stock price). There's an arbitrage opportunity, and on April 7th the biggest threat to that arbitrage is very very likely going to be removed.

https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing

So what do you, an ape, do with this information? Well you buy XLNX calls expiring April 9th of course. It's mostly algos trading options at the moment, but it looks like right now you can buy calls at $132 strike price for $2 a pop, and $126 calls for $5 a pop, which are completely reasonably prices compared to their equivalent AMD options. But unlike AMD calls, you wouldn't need AMD to go up for this YOLO to pay out. If the valuation gap closes after the yes vote on April 7th, and AMD stays the same price, you make 350% and 160% returns respectively. And obviously , if AMD goes up a few percent over this week, you make even more.

Full disclosure: I'm not a financial advisor. I lost 17k in a GME option play right when Vlad decided to stop trading on RH.

...but I still went all in on this play. 137c on 4/9


edit:
AMD has to drop to 75.43 (130/1.7234) to break even. If it's lower, then it's a loss.","['XLNX', 'AMD', 'GPS']"
mkxprj,gtimndf,wallstreetbets,comment,1617669788,"April 7th approval is basically assumed... positive price action from April 7th is minimal to zero 

On the extremely small chance that the merger is declined the negative price action on XLNX would be extreme. 

There is no real arbitrage opportunity, they will slowly start to trade more in line with eachother as a merger date gets closer and risk of no merger decreases... AMD can move down, XLNX can move up to achieve the ""correct"" price ratios. People can look at the APHA/TLRY merger if they want a current example of two companies doing the same thing right now. 

There is limited to zero upside, the eventual merger is already assumed and mostly priced in, in the unlikely event of a rejection the downside would be massive and instantly make your XLNX calls worthless. April 7th date is irrelevant to your short term weeklies, you will lose a ton of theta and might even lose some to IV decrease after the approval.","['XLNX', 'AMD']"

mkc5ei,,wallstreetbets,post,1617595208,"Institutional Investors Recently Buying GME and Not Exiting Full PositionI wanted to take a deeper look into GME and what the hedge funds have been doing recently with the stock. I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop. If we take a look at Institutional Ownership, there have been no fully executed exited positions with Hedge Funds recently. Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble? I believe so, here's some data to back that claim up.

Edit: I had to remove the screenshots from Fintel ,but I can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently.

If you take a look at GME stock during the dates of 25MAR2021 - 27MAR2021 and then compare that to the buys from Fintel, you can see there is a correlation. I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. 

Edit \^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip. We all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they don't get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction. In my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows? That is why I always encourage to buy shares not options. When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to? That's why I only buy shares with CASH NEVER on Margin.

Also a tip, use the indicator ""Accumulation/Distribution Indicator for analyzing Charts (Indicator available in Yahoo Finance)  Anything above a +5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors. Unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect it's price that dramatically. Anything under an Accumulation/Distribution Indicator of 0 leads me to believe that the price is going up due to retail investors buying the stock.

This is not financial advice, I just believe dearly in this stock and what it might be able to do for others in the future =)

May God Bless All of You

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

mk5h3m,,wallstreetbets,post,1617572208,"The US Gov't has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation**TL;DR: The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation. A 1% underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year. It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades.**

For background, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates inflation. It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque, and has been changed numerous times over the years. The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number. [\[1\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)

Many government revenues and expenditures are inflation-linked, either directly or indirectly.

**Directly linked:**

1. Social security payments

Social security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI-W (very similar to the CPI) [\[2\]](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/COLA/colasummary.html). Every year, the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation. It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth \~**$37 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by **$370 billion.**

2) Tax brackets

Tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation [\[3\]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp). This means, when the government underreports inflation, more people move up into higher tax brackets. It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues.

3) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities

These are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back, in both interest and principle, according to inflation. They are linked to the CPI. These securities (known as TIPS) compromise \~8% of the US federal debt [\[4\]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/tips.aspx). This is **\~$2.24 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by **$22 billion.** There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt.

**Indirectly linked:**

1. Debt interest payments

Investors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation. The US government has **\~$26 trillion** in Treasury debt. The yearly cost of servicing this debt is \~1-2% of that, roughly **$378 billion** in 2020. If investors were to expect higher inflation, this yearly cost would go up by \~**$260 billion** for every 1% increase in expected inflation.

There are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation, these are just the main ones I could find. When we add up all these policies, we see that underreporting inflation by just 1% can save the government **between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year**. This is 30% of the entire tax revenue of the US government. Underreporting inflation by 3-4% a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year.

**Evidence of underreporting**

There has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited. Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation?

1. Changes to the CPI formula

""Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living.1﻿ Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).

Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI."" [\[5\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)

Essentially, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported. When a good is considered to be of ""increased quality,"" its price increase is lowered to reflect this. When the price of one good goes up, its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another, lower-priced good is ""substituted"" for it.

2) Rent

In 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [\[6\]](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/). This is an increase of **54%**, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [\[7\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL), which is only a **31%** increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by **1.1%** per year. Keep in mind that, during the period just mentioned, the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen, during the 2007-2008 crisis. The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 [\[8\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA). Nonetheless, rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI.

What do you think? Is the US government massively underreporting inflation?",

mkxi0w,,wallstreetbets,post,1617664109,"$GOEV - Bullish theory - USPS Truck ContractDisclaimer: Not financial advice, I eat crayons.


Once I saw the Canoo trucks on their promotional video I thought there is promise for the modularity of them being good candidates for the new USPS truck. But the USPS truck contract was given to Oshkosh Corporation, right? Well maybe. Turns out someone bought 55 million shares before the contract went public. Speculation: If the SEC finds misconduct will the deal be null and void? The vehicles are not due till 2023. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oshkosh_Corporation (I have no idea how government contacts are dealt with)

If the bid is undone I think there are a couple good reasons they are a valid candidate.

**E.V. low speed efficiencies**

Electric Vehicles have insane gains on energy consumption at low speed. 

[Power Consumption Curve for Tesla Model S](https://i.stack.imgur.com/e98Er.png) ([post](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-physics.101931/)). Now I found an [article^1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213624X17300974) that concluded that switching Austin's USPS trucks to diesel trucks would cut down emissions. They used a speed of 15 mhp to run their simulations, note motor vehicles do not get the same energy gains at low speeds as e.v.[1]. I am not gonna even try to factor in the speeding up and down or the real characteristic of the battery pack (there will be energy loss but its Tesla's job to make these batteries as efficient as they can be). The [NEDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) estimates that full charge of 85 kWh can be discharged in 315 miles. User [Frank99](https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/177605/full-charge-range) found he can ride at around 244 Wh/mi for 40 miles at 70 mph. This took Frank 4/7 h or 0.57 hours.
 

With a size of 75k Wh for a total battery comes out to 75k Wh / 244 Wh / mi  = 307.38 miles. Pretty close to the NEDC estimation.

307 mi * (0.57 hours / 40 miles) = 4.385h of driving for an entire charge.

Total Watt hour consumed: 244 Wh/mi * 40 mi = 9.760 kWh

Referring to the first graph the car would be around 300 kW 'consumption' for the majority of the time. The energy spent to hold at that level was 9.760 kWh for 0.57 hours of driving at 70 mph. Now suppose you only need to run to say 15 miles an hour well now you would just need to hold it at 125 kW. Now here's where real research people would know how much of a reduction  in total power consumption this would be. I will guess the reduction to be around 1.5x (9.760 / 1.5 -> 6.467 kWh) this puts the range of the Tesla Model S to over 450 miles before a recharge, but you can kinda just plug in value here and then multiple it with 307 to get your new range. I think anything between 1 and 2 is a good estimate because the reduction in the overall energy cost is a little over 2. 

Now I could not find information on this but I think a USPS truck travel less than 450 miles a day. 

Canoo is probably following Tesla and just letting/following the EPA give their estimated ranges or not even publishing them because so much of the battery life is dependent on the driver's habits.

For viewing pleasure: https://www. yt .com/watch?v=rbnvZlPZZQc

**Modularity**

A general problem for the U.S. has is finding parts for stuff that is old.
The previous USPS fleet truck was designed as Life Long Vehicle and their repair cost went through the roof as time goes on. The USPS even acknowledged this back in 2010 ([pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20100714015726/http://www.uspsoig.gov/foia_files/DA-AR-10-005.pdf)). Per Canoo's promotional video they are focusing on reliability and resell ability.


**Replacing other LLV**

The deal with Oshkosh Corporation was for 50,000 to 165,000 to be produced. In 2010 there were 189,000 LLVs. There could be a cap for 165k LLVs now. Oshkosh could be capped at 50k if the USPS decides to revisit this after the investigation, as I do not think the plan of leaving 90% un-electrified fits with the current party.


[1] Tractor and stuff run at pretty low rpm on diesel so there is a chance to get close to e.v. levels of gains with new science but I haven't done the research, but pulling from article^1 the power consumption is 10x greater with their Diesel van than their electric van listed and they just use money. Coal factories as bad as they are way more efficient than car's when it comes to making energy.

mkk98g,,wallstreetbets,post,1617628007,"TSLA effective short interest could be as high as 26% - potential incoming short squeeze**TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction & options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

mktnmp,,wallstreetbets,post,1617653356,"Options are for Apes too (just not GME)# What Motivates an Ape

I started this project due to the **lack of options data available to the everyday ape**. While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. 

I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.

I've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. 

For this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization\_of\_all\_open\_option\_contracts\_on\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme/)

# Comparing MSFT to GME

My presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).

**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. 

If you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** 

**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**

[Absolute prices for the entire option chain of GME and MSFT. Options price behaviour is non-linear, making it difficult to trade based on tables\/numbers alone.  This was from last week, but data is collected daily. ](https://preview.redd.it/ipbfo81pjer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb896e446c085da7b5ede7ca88160da4d62d7d5e)

The main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. 

For sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  

**No one is buying GME Options!!**

If you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). 

&#x200B;

[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https://preview.redd.it/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)

Notice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. 

**Implied volatility and why/how thetagang makes money**

Implied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. 

What is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. 

This phenomenon of high IV at extreme strikes seen for the upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protecting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. 

Thetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. 

Implied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/io2zsncfuer61.png?width=11250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cad59452807ab45e7ef7094373b7d23a402f9f

Notice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.

# Conclusion

GME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.

Use the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).

mkpdvv,,wallstreetbets,post,1617642027,"Follow the breadcrumbs of AMRN buyoutAMARIN a $2.5 Billion company is probably going to get bought out by years end. 

Here are the breadcrumbs I followed to get to the conclusion.

1. The company recently won EU approval for its drug VASCEPA with exclusivity.
2.  China exclusivity will probably come online by end of year. Already got the ok for Hainan Medical Hub.
3. Insiders recently sold shares on Form 4's, but the bear minimum to cover taxes most likely .
4. Paid off all long term debt in one fell swoop. Plus has $900 Million loss carryforward.
5. But here is the kicker. They recently added the line ""**In the case of a Change of Control**"" under remarks. That wasn't there before. Link to one of the Form 4, if the picture doesn't load.

 I couldn't figure why big money was holding it down at first. But once I followed the breadcrumbs it makes sense. **🤟💎💎🤟🚀🌕 GL.**",['GL']
