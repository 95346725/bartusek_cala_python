Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

New investors (of which there are tens of millions now) need to know that on average the return of the market is around 10% (it ranges from 7%-11% depending on your metric, but for simplicities sake we'll average it to 10%).

If you have gone beyond that 10%, that is a good thing, but it is not the average, and in the long term few investors beat the market as time goes on. Generally, beating the market is an anomaly and hard to replicate over 10 and 20 year periods.

I think as a whole investors have been spoiled by the last year. The market was so awash with cash (and continues to be) from FED action that a monkey could throw darts at a board and make a lot of money.

I make this post only to say that for newer investors, those who have been investing just in the last few years, don't be disappointed when your performance doesn't match that of 2020. As far as statistical returns show us, that was far and away an anomaly.

I think it's prudent to temper your expectations. I don't mean sell, I don't mean you won't beat the market in the future, I just mean to say temper your expectations so that you don't become disenchanted with investing as time goes on. If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing. However, expecting 30%-500% growth in less than a year is only going to make you feel disappointed when your stocks don't meet that expectation.

https://twitter.com/PalantirTech/status/1390562068315656194?s=20

May 07, 2021 02:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today the renewal of its contracts with the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy for its Palantir Foundry platform. Palantir’s software is used by the Royal Navy across a broad spectrum of areas from strategic workforce planning to supply chain management to the COVID-19 response.

Palantir is enabling naval personnel, as well as civilians and contractors, most without programming expertise, to access and engage with a curated, single source of truth. Users are empowered to run complex models to test scenarios to make better decisions, faster. The Royal Navy has developed its own digital skills and data expertise through its adoption of Foundry - a growing number of naval personnel are programming and building directly in Foundry, showcasing their growing self-sufficiency and new technical competence.

The renewed agreements will allow the Royal Navy to continue reaping the benefits of a more empowered workforce, whilst keeping tight control of security and privacy of its data, and full ownership of the logic behind its data model.

The investment the Royal Navy made in Foundry meant it was able to react quickly to the COVID-19 crisis early last year. It took the Royal Navy less than 48 hours to stand up a Recognised People Picture in Foundry using self-reported updates to inform leadership of the impact of the pandemic on its force. The Royal Navy is applying this new data-driven approach to ensure readiness of its strength, proactive alerting on equipment health and inventory risk, fully transparent and informed maintenance delivery, all combined to increase the availability of its forces.

The February 2021 edition of Navy News noted that Foundry had “allowed the Personnel and Training (P&T) organisation to establish 200 temporary units, tasks, and positions to support the Covid response: from drivers for semi-refrigerated trucks to engineers conducting maintenance tasks to Royal Navy medics supporting the government’s broader pandemic response, ensuring resilience to operations. Looking ahead, the development of a strength modelling process in Foundry will allow better understanding of the pandemic’s long-term impact on future force readiness. Strategic planners can model a variety of scenarios quickly and independently, so that they can make sure there are enough training courses and promotion opportunities for example, to help the Royal Navy continue to adapt to changing circumstances.”

“We are proud to be supporting the Royal Navy in its important mission and delighted to see the way in which it is using Foundry in support of the First Sea Lord’s objective to use technology and innovation, in a much bigger way than the Royal Navy has been to date, to drive everything it does” says Shyam Sankar, COO of Palantir.","['TWTR', 'COO']"

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”  

I am all in on VWAPY and POAHY. I am a bit biased - drive Porsche Macan and love it. Will be switching to Taycan within 12-18 months but apparently they are already back ordered for months. 

And no, this isn’t intended to be a detailed DD, so don’t come at me for that. :). Just sharing what I read this morning.

EDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.

The main problem with IBM is that they need more current IP. Lots of their old patents are less and less useful by the day. At the same time their real growth is pretty bad outside of Red Hat, everything else only goes down. So, discounting RH, with IBM you are paying like 100 Billion for declining businesses.

My thinking is that that the market opens and closes to reflex the 9-5 workday, when someone actually physically needed to execute trades. However this is no longer the case, as trades can be made relatively instantly on a phone. 

So this brings me back to my question, why does it open/close each day? My conspiracy brain tells me it’s because the “big boys” use this time to game the market. And I can’t really come up am with any other rational.

I’m thinking in terms for tax purposes, where my understanding is if you have a stock for over a year the tax implications are different.

I don't mean to self promote, but I originally made this research report on my blog ([http://tedinvests.com/posts/](http://tedinvests.com/posts/)) and I'm now posting it on Reddit for anyone looking for an in-depth understanding of this company. While I posted a decent amount of it on here, the report goes far more into depth and provides charts/graphs and videos.

(I don't receive any sort of payment for the report, I simply make them to help myself and others)

**Company Description:**

Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in the United States and offers consumers a range of various plant-based meats. This company’s mission is to build meat directly from plants and have their final product consist of the same attributes as actual meat products. Beyond Meat’s products are designed to be more nutritional than that of regular meat, although the nutritional aspects of plant-based meats have been questioned. While plant-based meats may or may not be more nutritional than regular meat, by shifting to plant-based meats people can positively affect growing global issues. The issues which this company is trying to address include human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare. Their products consist of the Beyond Burger, meatballs, sausage, beef, and more. Besides certain Beyond Crumbles, all of their products are certified Kosher and Halal. As of December 2021, you can find Beyond Products available at approximately 122,000 retailer and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries. In addition, Beyond Meat has an e-commerce site which offers consumers bulk packs, mixed product bundles, and trial packs. This company is constantly innovating and their R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of the biggest food companies (Nestle, Kroger, etc.) at 7.8%. Their state-of-the-art innovation center is a 30,000 sq. foot building located in El Segundo California. This company’s mission is simple to understand, through a unique and innovative approach make the best product that gets as close as possible to real meat all while benefiting the planet.

**Total Addressable Market** (TAM)

In 2020 the plant-based meat market was estimated to be valued at $4.3 billion and is projected to reach $8.3 billion by 2025. All that growth registers a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. Much of the growth that we are witnessing is due to the growing vegan, vegetarian, and health conscious trends people are adopting. Also, many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products. All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy, but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems. While the plant-based market may not be the largest, Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry. The global meat industry is valued at $1.2 trillion and had a CAGR of 2.4% between 2015 and 2019. Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price. Beyond Meat’s Beyond Sausage sells for $10.30 a pound, that is about 70% more than regular pork sausage. One pound of factory-farmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around $3/pound, while one pound of Beyond Meat’s Beef Burger will run you around $6.25/pound. While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot, that doesn’t mean that people don’t buy Beyond Meat products. Going forward we’ll have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat market.

**Recent Developments/Acquisitions**

**The new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide (April 27, 2021) –** Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35% less fat and saturated fat, and fewer calories than 80/20 beef. This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd. It will be available in a 2-pack, the brand’s first ever value 4-pack, and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack. Dariush Ajami, the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat, said ” We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plant-based beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience. The new Beyond Burger’s rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef, and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring on-par with 80/20 ground beef burgers.” According to the University of Michigan’s 2018 Life Cycle Assessment, when compared to traditional 80/20 beef burgers, the Beyond Burger has 99% less impact on water scarcity, 93% less impact on land use, requires 46% less energy, and generates 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

**Beyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe (April 12, 2021) –** Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations. The plant-based foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49% over the last two years. In the U.K, Sainsbury’s said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide. Also, Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage. The retailers together increased Beyond Meat’s presence in 445 stores. In Germany, Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1,000 German retail stores through Kaufland, Tegut, Famila, and Real. In Austria, the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1,500 retail stores. Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores. Nearly 1,000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince. Chuck Muth, the Chief Growth Officer at the company, said “These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europe’s appetite for plant-based meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise.” Moreso, in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first co-manufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen World’s Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude Netherland.

**Beyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation (April 7, 2021) –** Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai. Ethan Brown, CEO, said “The opening of our dedicated plant-based meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meat’s ability to effectively compete in one of the world’s largest meat markets. We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth, and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.” Just a little over a year ago, Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks. In addition to Starbucks, Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Jindingxuan, GangLi Beijing, Slow Boat Brewery, Hema, METRO China and more. Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that they’ve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market, Beyond Pork.

**What could go wrong**

**Foodservice doesn’t pick up –** Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries. In the past we’ve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically, only to fall back to where it was before a few days after. Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, KFC, and a number of other restaurants. Looking at the foodservice side of their business, they’ve seen tremendous YoY growth. While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales, many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back. While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward, I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out. Impossible foods is their main competitor and they’ve partnered with the likes of Burger King, White Castle, Red Robin, and others. These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue. The questions that remain to be asked are, in the long-run, how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat? Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plant-based protein products and how many others will follow? Furthermore, Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales. There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then? Nonetheless, I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years.","['KR', 'SBUX', 'WMT', 'EL']"

For a variety of reasons:Steel manufacturing companies are set to make record profits in the next few years. Demand is up huge. [The post-COVID boom is starting.](https://www.appraisalbuzz.com/biggest-construction-boom-since-2006-best-2-weeks-for-rates-in-a-year/) The rotation out of tech is under way. And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:

-----------------------------------

**Steel prices are obscenely high**

These are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 – 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) 

And this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) 

This means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).

--------------------------------

**Inflation**

The hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation? Many expect inflation to climb regardless as there has been so much money printed. During periods of high inflation, Michael Burry thinks you want to be in [real estate and commodities](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859/photo/1). 

And even if inflation doesn’t cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.

------------------------------------

**China's rebate**

In 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world’s steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.

But now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. 

Starting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff & 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it’s getting a lot worse.

Starting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor’s product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.

**Where in particular to invest?** 

Steel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)

There is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.

CLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will ""look after shareholders"" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.

CLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.

As people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. 

MT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade. [Commodities Boom Grips Steel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/arcelormittal-reports-best-quarter-in-decade-as-steel-joins-boom)

n6xzai,,stocks,post,1620392547,"Investing in tech in the current regulatory climate - theory and discussion.Hi all,

First time poster. I have been thinking about the future of tech investments. As some background, I work in the field of competition law & regulation. Currently there are cases against Google and Facebook in the US, the latter may even lead to divestiture or total breaking up of the ecosystem.

Aside from that there is regulation on the way in the EU, the DMA and DSA will have far reaching consequences for the profitability of app stores, causing me concerns about Apple. Aside from that Amazon is under investigation as well. Aside from app stores there are also strict rules surrounding search engines. 

Right now I feel like only Amazon and Microsoft will be able to deal properly with the fallout of the changing regulatory landscape. Amazon as it is so diversified that it's a safe bet somewhat. However, I'm worried that Amazon is already so high (and public opinion of their employment terms are so bad) that there will be some inevitable fallout.

Now I'm left wondering if Microsoft is the right long-term investment. They are not overly data reliant and are building up positions in more and more areas for professional software. The only thing that concerns me is that Microsoft has a bad track record when it comes to being innovative. I fear some of their projects will ultimately fail as they are becoming perhaps the ""dinosaur"" of the tech world. 

I was wondering about your views and opinions. How likely do you think it is that new regulation or antitrust interventions will significantly harm the growth potential of these stocks? Am I missing something in my evaluation?","['FB', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']"

n6ynt9,,stocks,post,1620394587,"Can someone explain why selling and buying a stock/asset back at a lower cost is a stupid idea when it dips?So yes I am a new investor and I’m trying to understand this. Let’s say for example Stock X is $10. It has a good run up to  $70 over a course of 2 months and because of its high run up and RSI, you know that there will be a pull back. Let’s say now you invested 100k. This 100k has essentially 7x to 700k, but since you did not sell it at $70, it then pulled all the way back to $30 so you now have 300k. You've essentially lost out of 400k profit before tax is considered.

Why do people say it’s stupid to sell it just to rebuy it back? If you knew there would be a pull back due to the RSI, sell at $70, then rebuy the dip when it’s back at $30? Sure you pay short term capital gains but you’ve now doubled your position at the same price, assuming you reinstate all that money back into that stock. You can now increase your position, but just pay a higher average cost of $30 rather than at $10. What am I not understanding for those that hold when you know the RSI will indicate a strong dip?

n6xphy,,stocks,post,1620391716,"CRWD valuation and upcoming earnings on May 31Crowdstrike is a cyber security company that provides end host security to prevent breaches and data theft. They have earnings on June 3 for Q1FY22. They posted Q4FY21 earnings on March 18, at one of the brutal red days of the Nasdaq+tech fuckfest.

Currently, CRWD is trading at December 17 levels. Lets take a look at its current valuation and try to understand its short term and long term upsides. We can also compare CRWD to NET and see where the valuations sit.

First lets look at Q4 and FY2021.

https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/8906/html

The biggest thing to note here is that CRWD is on a 100% yoy revenue trajectory. This is impressive as they've done this for 4 years straight. In FY2021, they were able to pull in $874M revenue, growth of 81% yoy. Their profit also grew 89% comparatively as they were able to drive down the costs of both their product and services increasing margin for both.

Taking into account FY21 revenue, their current P/S value is 48 (42B mktcap by 874M sales). If CRWD announces first quarter revenue of $380M, which would project it for another 80% YoY growth, then consider the stock price to go back up to $220 as we'll try to project to a P/S of 48. If CRWD earnings drop below that, I could see the stock drop to $150 at growth has slowed and the P/S would no longer justify its valuation.

Looking at their projections from their April investor relations deck:
https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/2852082c-2ce8-4d5d-96ad-0e2cb1bd8edc

CRWD is expecting to hit $3Bn ARR in 2025. As of FY2021, they are are $1Bn ARR. 

Overall, I think CRWD is fairly priced currently at $190 compared to other high performing industryplayers. I think CRWD can easily get to $220 based on speculation or if they have a good revenue Q1. I think $240 is very reasonable by end of year due to secular trends in security concerns. Their investor presentation is compelling, showing large TAM growth and tailwinds in cybersecurity. Additionally, over the next 4 years, CRWD is planning to release new products that break into new markets that increase their TAM by 2x (from 44Bn in 2021 to 106Bn in FY25). Compare this to how the market reacted when NET released their serverless platform and the stock jumped 15%. Tackling a new market creates strong tailwinds in growth.

Betting on CRWD at this current price is betting that cyber security and endpoint protection will be critical for large businesses going forward. Do you believe that corporations will see nation state and corporate sponsored cyber security attacks going forward? If so, Crowdstrike is a place you should be seriously considering putting money.

I got into CRWD at $185, but I unfortunately averaged up to a cost average of $209. Seeing CRWD at $190 feels like a fair price, and anything below $180 feels like a deal. The upside potential with regards to risk/reward feels good below $180. At around $200, it could go either way and you may just break even short term.

Long term, I think CRWD has the legs to grow 20% this year.","['NDAQ', 'IR']"

n6xphy,gx9plpq,stocks,comment,1620393056,"Personally, I think they're overvalued, and they've now gone up further pre-market. The other red flag is that their revenue has almost doubled YoY for the last 4 years, as has their gross profit, but their earnings have remained at a similar value (in the negative). They also took on a massive amount of debt in 2021. Still a very speculative play. I hope it pays off for you, but its still a very risky position.",

n6gx5p,,stocks,post,1620333190,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 6, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

In short, it seems like the entire tech sector went out of favor for the last quarter. But... if there's a turnaround in the segment, they have some good lights ahead of them. 

TL;DR - Why I'm invested in them. I really do like the company. I'm big into these guys. Maybe with GME's PC Sales push, that'll shine some light on CRSR. Maybe they'll get bought out by MSFT or AMZN who wants a more substantial play into the gaming and streaming market. Not sure, but I'm long on the stock with XXXX shares. 

**Positions**:

# Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy. 

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)). 

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR. 

# Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.  

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing. Grassroots matters, but more is needed to go from early adopters to mainstream market.","['MSFT', 'PPL', 'AMZN']"

So when you buy a call option you are buying a contract with the ""Right but not the obligation"" to buy the stock at the strike price but you aren't actually buying the stock.

So IF GME went up to $805 before the expiration date the value if you sold the option the profit would not be huge, it would be it would only be a few dollars per share",

To give some context, they had to do a product recall on their treadmills due to some injuries. Their treadmills represent about 2-3% of their total sales and the stock dipped about 15%. Quite honestly this seems like a massive overreaction. Don’t see a massive risk here as their bikes are the major driver of their business. Even pricing in a few lawsuits and costs related to the recall, I don’t think a 15% dip was justified. 

Basic math/logic above coupled with the fact that everyone I know who has a peloton bike is absolutely obsessed with it lead me to scoop up some shares around $83 this week.

Seeing their incredibly low churn rate on subscriptions and high engagement in their content  (26 workouts / month?!) is encouraging. Yeah, the fitness market is tough, but their secret sauce is and will be content, talent and ecosystem. The subscription model is cheap compared to a gum membership for their target market and they have plans for more hardware to attract more customers.

Biggest threat is probably Apple - they launched their own fitness content and already have strong shares in hardware and adoption.

DON'T SELL A SINGLE SHARE right now. 

Energy is a very good place to be as we exit the pandemic.  And although you are right that most of the profit was winter storm Uri related, it was all good news for ET this quarter. In the conference call management stated they are seeing record volumes in their system right now.  They are also locking in long term contracts at good prices. They guided EBIDTA up and leverage down. 

Also, ET has been a very, very controversial stock. Not so much on reddit but check out how many negative articles have been written about ET on Seeking Alpha.  And ET's price has been very depressed due to a combination of poor strategy (Kelcy Warren is incapable of not buying companies), over leverage, Covid, DAPL pipeline woes,, fossil fuels being in disfavor, etc.  Now all of these factors are starting to move back in ET's favor.  The ENBL acquisition was great!  ENBL had a hell of a quarter (2× estimates).  Market conditions are improving.  DAPL is priced in.  And most importantly, management has finally figured out that the single most important metric right now is reducing leverage.  They have gone from ignoring their over leverage to bragging about reducing their leverage.  They will soon go from credit watch negative to stable..  As these positive factors get priced in you could see a big move up in ET.  Look at MPLX as a guide for what ET will do when the leverage is reduced and they  can repurchase units.

As such I figured I'd just make a quick post to recommend what I feel is the best way to get started in the stock market.

**Step 1: Take 90% of your capital that you would like to invest and put it in a total market index fund like VTI or FZROX**

You're new at this, no matter how much research you have done you don't know what you're doing and will make mistakes. Putting your money into an index fund will give you good returns along with the security of knowing with 99.999% certainty that if there is a dip it WILL recover (and if it doesn't you probably have bigger problems to worry about). It will also help you get used to the ups and downs of the market without getting emotional.

**Step 2: Start paper trading**

Most brokerages offer a ""paper trading"" account. These are accounts where you invest with fake money and can track how you would have done with these investments. I know you're excited and want to start investing now so you can make money, but you're new and will likely fall into one of several common pitfalls of new investors, better to do this with fake money than real money. And besides if you follow step 1 your money *is* invested and you are getting good returns.

**Step 3*: Start using your 10% cash to make real stock purchases**

 Once you do well after a few months to a year of paper trading (it seems like a long time I know but trust me the stock market will still be there when you're done), take some of your remaining capital and start buying stocks. Real investing is not like paper trading when it comes to your actual money, keep that in mind. You will find yourself panicking for the first time here, that's fine, remember the vast majority of your money is in a solid investment with little risk and good returns.

**Step 4*: Start moving more into stock picks**

After a few years of doing well with your 10%, if you feel like you'd rather pick your own stocks over using an index fund then start moving money out of your total market index funds into individual stock picks

And that's it, that's (in my opinion) the best way to get started in the stock market. Any additional tips from you guys?

*These steps aren't actually necessary, you can just leave 100% of your capital in total market index funds and you will be fine, in fact that's what I would recommend you do but I realize that many people, especially those that come to this subreddit, would rather take their chances and try to outperform the market",['UPS']

n6byd0,,stocks,post,1620320311,"VIAC is very undervalued in an overvalued market and just had an amazing earnings reportVIAC is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping.","['NFLX', 'VIAC']"

However, it seems the market won't value this company more than it is.

Look at their [2018-Q4 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/d50946cf-2bb8-441f-a8ad-a8e118ff44cf): Revenues: 7B, EPS: 1.43. Share price back then: $43.72

Look at their [2021-Q1 results](https://ir.viacomcbs.com/static-files/78a9d2e0-5f09-4f6f-b890-45b139769eff): Revenues: 7.4B, EPS: 1.42. Share price now: $38.15

So they had the same results in 2018 than on 2021 and the share price is just $5 dollars of difference.

The market is showing the same love for this company now than in 2018.

Why is this company more worth now than in 2018? The competition from Netflix and other online platforms can't be ignored.

EDIT: look at the PEG ratio fo this company.. is negative.

My investments are pretty diversified; Real Estate, Stocks, CDs, Pokemon cards (joking!), etc. I've been reading a lot of positive things about having a portion of your portfolio dedicated to dividends. I'm interested and looking for ideas. I'm sure if we get enough heads
 together we can come up with some ideas to not only help me but other people as well.

Personally, I'm looking for mostly sideways-ish trading stocks, low priced, with a decent dividend payment. Doesn't have to meet those things exactly I guess it mostly just depends on the stock/company.

For example, $ORC (Orchid Island) mostly trades sideways. Has a monthly dividend of .07 and is low priced at currently $5.50 per share. That means with a 150k investment you could buy 27,272 shares and have a monthly dividend payment of $1900 per month (roughly).

Do you have a sexy dividend portfolio or ideas for one? I'd love to pick your brain and I'm sure many other people would as well.

n6uhtc,,stocks,post,1620379484,"Is 9 stocks enough? (mid-term dividend portfolio)Hey guys,

I put some money in a target retirement fund in a Roth IRA every year.  Recently however for various reasons (Covid, stimulus, etc.) I'm sitting on a lot of extra cash.  I already put a lot in series I bonds (inflation-protected), but I think I can do better than that and want to invest a good bit in taxable account as well.  For now I don't need the money, and I've got my 1st tier (cash) and 2nd tier (savings bonds) emergency funds set already.  But looking at a 3-5 year time horizon there's a lot of uncertainty for me right now and I may have some big purchases (major home renovations, back to school, new car, etc.)   Again, though, I don't just want to sit on cash or savings bonds and miss out on gains.

Right now my taxable account has 50% index funds (VTI and VXUS).  These are great long-term plays but I'm worried about having total market exposure in the event that I need to pull out equity at some point.  The absolute worst thing that could happen would be for markets to drop 30% right when I need to access that cash.

Thus I'm considering creating a fully defensive portfolio for the meantime, collecting dividends with some hopes for modest capital appreciation.  I have 9 stocks that I already own or that are on my watchlist.  My question is that if this will provide enough diversification for the short-to-mid term.  If you're interested, here they are:

1. MSFT
2. AAPL (these two are not for dividends, I just think they're solid companies worth holding in any portfolio)
3. BTI
4. IMBBY
5. PM
6. MO
7. UVV (3-7 are tobacco companies)
8. KO
9. PAAS (mining stock / inflation hedge)

Everything would be about equally weighted with some minor variations.

Obviously I'm way overweight on tobacco but I've done research into the industry and in the next decade or so these companies aren't going anywhere.  Hell, I'm confident even on a longer time horizon and already hold a couple of these in my portfolio.  I do see long-term risk because it's a declining industry, but again, I anticipate ample time to get out and/or rebalance.

I don't anticipate any of these companies suddenly going bankrupt... they have good balance sheets and strong cash flows.  That said, I am concerned that some unforeseen event could wipe out 10%+ of my portfolio.  I think mid-term this portfolio makes sense, but I'm new to this, so I just want to see what more experienced people think about the soundness of this allocation.

I'll also take any recommendations if you want to help bump me up to 10+. =\]","['KO', 'PM', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'MO']"

There are surprises that could happen that you’re not ready for - though it looks like you’ve considered this and is a risk you’re willing you take. I would suggest you pick the one or two tobacco stocks you are most confident in and load up on just them (my personal vote is BTI). 

Other stocks/industries that held up like soldiers last March are telecom, defense, and big pharma. VZ, LMT, LHX, BMY, MRK, and ABBV are ones off the top of my head. You’d get some industry diversification with those and Buffett owns the listed telco and big pharma stocks.

For what it is worth my portfolio looked similar to this and I eventually moved most of it into big tech. I think Google, Facebook, and Amazon are great investments but probably more variable than what you’re looking for.

NET got clobbered today because FSLY put up weak growth numbers and the market reacted heavily.

NET was trading at $25 before the COVID mess took over, and its been on a 3x rocket ship trajectory ever since.

NET has higher margins than FSLY, operates in a more diverse space and has a different value proposition. With a wider base of customers and larger margins, NET may fair better than FSLY in earnings.

That being said, what is a good valuation for NET in your opinion?

The lowest NET has gotten in the past 6 months is $61 on March 8 at the bottom of the bump.

Do you think that's a fair price for NET?

I'm a big holder of NET, and have been adding over the past year. Its a shame to see it get blown up and caught up in the recently reversion to mean of cloud stocks.

As a relative measure, on February 11 NET had their annual report. Their revenue was $431M, up 50% yoy with a cagr of 50% yoy for 5 years. To maintain that growth, NET needs to put up revenues of about $160M. The current estimates are about $130M. If NET misses this price at all, I think it free-falls all teh way to the low 50's.

They're definitely an expensive company, and depending on your horizons getting in at $60 may be a good entry. But with a volatile stock like this, consider a DCA strategy since it can bounce around a lot.

If you do decide to lump sum into NET, consider buying PUTS to hedge against short term bounces.",

I got a list of 4000ish tickers and dropped them in then brought in the data using excel. You can then start to calculate some of the key ratios.

You can cut it up by sector, market cap, whatever you want and look into things. So if for example I saw the current shortage in semiconductors and I wanted to look at the companies producing them due to the demand, I’d filter down and have a look at those. You only have to pay for excel which you can use for so many other things (you could do something similar in a free alternative) rather than a screener website subscription. 

There are a ton of sources out there as well, such as Seeking Alpha, OpenInsider or Whale Wisdom which can help with ideas once you have something you’re looking for. I’d recommend reading a lot before diving in though as knowing what you’re looking for is 90% of the battle.

Peloton is recalling its Tread+ and Tread treadmills, the at-home fitness company said on Wednesday, less than a month after it fought the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission as it warned that dozens of injuries and one death of a child had been linked to the machines.

The commission, which issued an “urgent warning” for the machines in April, urged people who own the treadmills to immediately stop using them. Peloton is offering a full refund for the $4,295 machine with a 32-inch touch screen that allows runners to work out with the aid of instructors.

John Foley, the chief executive of Peloton, said in a statement Wednesday that the company had “made a mistake” by fighting the agency’s request to recall the treadmills, and apologized for not engaging “more productively with them from the outset.”

“The decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s members and their families,” he said in the statement.

The machines were sold in the United States from November to March. The company is working on a repair to be offered to customers “in the coming weeks,” the commission said in a statement. The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.

“Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products,” Robert S. Adler, the acting chairman of the commission, said in the statement.

The commission said it had received 72 reports of adults, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Twenty-nine involved children, including a 6-year-old boy who died.

After the death of the child in March, the company urged users to keep Peloton products where children can’t get to them and store safety keys away from children",['MS']

**Key Numbers**

Price: \~$18.54

Market Cap: $3.73B

**Description**

Genius Sports ($GENI) recently reverse merged with DMYD to become a publicly traded company. GENI provides sports data and solutions in multiple ways. Recently, they centralized all of the NCAA’s sports data and stats. This would be 1,100 universities and colleges among three divisions. As such, they were able to provide sports data for 50,000 events in their first 18 months of going live. NCAA basketball, football, volleyball, ice hockey and soccer leagues all use the Genius Sports LiveStats software. 

Furthermore, Genius provides media solutions for both sports teams and sportsbooks. For example, the Vancouver Canucks hired them to target ads to fans for special offers on tickets. This led to an 875% return on investment for the Canucks, so it’s a service they’re likely to keep using. The media department is just getting started as Genius just [doubled their revenue in that department](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/).

Most importantly and what amounts to 74% of their revenue, Genius Sports provides sports betting data in a variety of ways. First and foremost, they supply 40% of the sportsbooks with their betting lines, and this includes live betting. DraftKings, FanDuel, bet365, and many other Sportsbooks use GENI’s software and data for line setting. What this means is that it doesn’t matter which sportsbook does the best, as GENI supplies data to many of them.

Genius Sports is currently the leader in their field, and they have exclusive rights with multiple leagues. Among those are FIBA (pretty much every basketball league not in the USA), the NCAA, NFL, English Premier League, and many more. GENI actually has employees in attendance at the games to ensure they get the data in real time. Genius currently covers more than 240,000 events each year of which 110,000 are exclusive, and they have more than 650 long-term partnerships with sports leagues and sportsbooks.

Their operations were sourced from the SEC 4K below. Look specifically at pages 154-170 and 205-221 for the business and products.

[https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-010240/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-010240/)

**Sports Betting Outlook**

Sports betting hasn’t even come close to hitting its peak in the United States. In 2018, *Murphy v. NCAA* ruled that the federal government couldn’t make sports betting illegal; that decision was in violation of the 10th Amendment since those powers are not delegated to the Fed explicitly. Since then, [22 states have launched sports betting, 3 just had bills passed recently, and 22 have introduced bills](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/19740480/the-united-states-sports-betting-where-all-50-states-stand-legalization). That means that ***only 3 states have not attempted to legalize sports betting in some capacity*****.** Everyone has been talking about the impending legalization of marijuana and which companies will skyrocket because of that, but sports betting is already here, and no one is talking about what the plays are outside of DKNG and PENN.

Sports betting is less morally gray than marijuana to politicians, so full US legalization of sports betting is literally a couple years away. Also unlike the marijuana industry, sports data companies have already been established and operating in the legal sector for some time. There’s more to sports data than just sports betting. NFL nerds like myself can browse Football Reference for hours and look at OJ Simpson’s stats from his 2,000 yards season. Pro Football Focus has revolutionized the NFL with analytics. Genius Sports distributes stats for FIBA and has their media department.

Live betting has been seeing an increase in popularity and is actually more popular than pregame betting, especially in Europe. For this reason, it’s crucial that the data is as accurate, fast, and reliable as possible. Most of the states that legalize betting also legalize mobile betting, meaning that people can bet all day every day from their phone. In-game betting is huge and is expected to grow in the US much like it has in Europe. I’m unable to find the source, but I’ve read that roughly 60% of bets placed in Europe are live bets. Genius Sports gets a cut of each wager placed, which means the more live bets taking place means more money for GENI.

**Consistent Customers**

Genius Sports has only lost one customer in their history, and that customer ended up coming back to them. They always seem to be in the headlines for acquiring new deals. Recently they partnered with [Major League Rugby](https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/genius-sports-betting/) to be their data distributor, acquired [FanHub](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genius-sports-acquires-fanhub-leading-110000827.html) for the media solutions, and signed a deal with the NFL.

GENI has a habit of signing contracts with customers for a minimum of 4-5 years, but sometimes longer. Their deal with NCAA is for 10 years and was signed in 2018. In 2019 they signed with FIBA for 15 years. Their contracts have guaranteed minimums with escalators as well.

Most exciting and the cherry on top for Genius Sports is the aforementioned [deal with the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) to be their exclusive data distributor. The NFL dominates ratings, as Monday Night Football, Sunday Night Football, and Thursday Night Football were the [top 3 most popular series](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2019-2020-season-masked-singer-last-dance-1234612885/) according to TV ratings. Oftentimes a random Thursday Night Football game will have higher ratings than games from the NHL Finals, World Series, and NBA Finals. 

The fact of the matter is that the NFL is king when it comes to viewership, and Genius is set to capitalize. Additionally, part of the NFL deal was that the NFL would get an equity stake, so it’s in the league’s best financial interest that Genius Sports also does well financially. Making this an even sweeter deal is that GENI’s main competitor, SportRadar, was the official provider of the NFL prior to this. In other words, Genius Sports was able to steal their biggest competitor’s big fish client right when the league has finally started to fully embrace betting.

**Financials**

Financially this company has room for improvement. They have $391M in assets but $530M in liabilities. However, this is for the 2020 year, and they’ve since gained extra capital from merging with DMYD and now being publicly listed. $350M of their liabilities are preferred securities, meaning that companies with equity stakes (like the NFL) are buying those special shares for a dividend. This isn’t a huge deal because those investors believe in Genius to stay afloat and grow, otherwise they wouldn’t expect a dividend.

According to the investor presentation linked above, they should now have a debt free balance sheet upon completion of their merger with DMYD. GENI’s upcoming earnings report will be big to see if that is actually true. In 2019 they reported an EPS of -0.23. I can’t find EPS for 2020, but their EPS in Q4 2020 was -0.08, so I’d have to imagine that they did slightly worse.

They reported positive EBITDA of 8% this last year, and they’re projecting an EBITDA margin of 18% for 2021 and 29% for the 2022 fiscal years. Additionally, revenue is fast increasing, as their 2020 revenue of $149M was a [30% increase](https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2021/04/28/genius-sports-returns-to-profit-as-nyse-journey-begins/) of $114M the year prior. Considering they were able to increase revenue in a year where sports practically didn’t exist for a quarter of the year, this is wildly impressive. Genius believes that a 30% CAGR is more than doable, and they expect revenue to be $190M in 2021 and $238M in 2022. DKNG won’t be profitable for a few years *at least*, but profitability is right around the corner for GENI.

It must be noted that the numbers in the above paragraph are from their investor presentation which was released ***before their deal with the NFL***. 

**Valuation**

I’m not great at valuation, but if someone else is please feel free to chime in. For what it’s worth, Simply Wall Street says that this company is priced [roughly at fair valuation](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-geni/genius-sports#valuation). Additionally, analysts have set price targets anywhere from [$25-30](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GENI/research-ratings). This is probably flawed logic, but if DraftKings is roughly $55 a share right now with a market cap of $22 billion, I gotta imagine the company that they rely on for their product is worth more than $3.73 billion. In fact, according to Niccolo de Masi, CEO of dMY Technology (the company GENI merged with to go public), DraftKings listed in their prospectus that Genius Sports going out of business is a risk factor.

**Bear Cases**

There are a handful of risk factors, and most importantly is that they have one main competitor in SportRadar. As stated earlier, Genius provides data for 40% of sportsbooks. SportRadar provides another 40% of the books with data, and the remaining 20% is split among a handful of other companies. SportRadar mainly does data for the NHL, NASCAR, and NBA (for which they have exclusive rights). 

SportRadar runs Cleaning the Glass, Sports Reference, and Stat Head, websites where you can look at stats dating back to the inception of each league (really cool stuff if you’re into that). With that being said, I believe there’s room for two companies even though they’re competitors, which is a thought that de Masi also backs. SportRadar is rumored to merge with HZON, and full disclosure I do own only a small position as it’s not actually official yet.

As with anything, the Fed could decide they don’t like it and make it illegal. I believe that to be unlikely, as sports betting provides a great amount of revenue for the State, and the government more than likely will take any extra avenue of money considering all the cash recently printed.

Financially they’re not exactly the most sound at the moment, so that risk is obviously there. A downside to their deal with the NFL is that it’s pretty damn expensive: $120M a year. Half of that will be paid through equity, so Genius is really paying $60M a year. A value investor (which I mainly try to be) would look at GENI’s balance sheet and free cash flow and say “no thanks”. 

I believe the opportunity for huge growth is so great that I can’t resist. Profitability looks like it’s around the corner. Plus, if I”m gonna sports gamble I may as well invest in what I’m losing my money in.

If you have anything to add, any questions or critique about my DD (this is my first one), I’d love to hear it. If I’m flat out wrong about something, please correct me, especially when it comes to explaining the financial stuff.

I’d also love to hear other sports betting stocks of interest. Thanks, and let’s make money from sports gambling.

**tldr;** Sportsbooks such as DraftKings, Bet365, FanDuel and more outsource all of the sportsbooks lines. When you bet against “Vegas” in sports, international basketball, the NFL, March Madness and more, you’re actually betting on the lines provided by GENI. Sports betting is being legalized rapidly, and GENI is the pick and shovels for the industry. I’m shook this hasn’t been getting more coverage, either here or from the general media.

Most of the companies she chose do not even have a P/E ratio because they're too young or simply aren't yet profitable. For the minority of companies that are profitable - you're paying an absolute premium for it. Some of these companies have growing debt in spite of higher revenue. Others are funding their growth by increasing their shares, which dilutes the ones you own and depreciates their value. 

Some people are misguided thinking that ARK investments are inherently safer due to them being ETF's. That's not the case when all of her companies follow that theme of ""disruption"" at the cost of being way overvalued.

They're going to go down a lot more before going up again. Might as well put that money to better use and consider moving into ARK at a later date.",

> Volkswagen has set itself a 2025 deadline for overtaking U.S. pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O) and becoming the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), a plan that includes building six battery factories in Europe alone by 2030.

Details:

> Tensions over emissions cuts came to a head at a board meeting of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in March, two people familiar with the matter said.

> Several chief executives said they were concerned about the prospect of tougher EU standards, as they could blow a hole in profits from fossil-fuel engines that could not yet be plugged by electric vehicles, the two people said.

> But Diess took a more upbeat view, saying his company's EVs would achieve cost parity by the mid-2020s, a comment that raised eyebrows among fellow CEOs at the meeting including Renault's Luca de Meo, one of the people said.

Also:

> At the moment, the European industry must deliver fleet-wide cuts in emissions of 37.5% by 2030 for new passenger cars from 2021 limits - equivalent to a reduction from 95 grams of CO2 per km this year to 59 g/km at the end of the decade.

> One person familiar with the matter said the industry was now bracing for this target reduction to rise to at least 50% when the European Commission unveils its plans.

And:

> Selling mass-market EVs is also vital to earn valuable carbon credits that carmakers can sell to rivals struggling to meet EU emissions targets.

> EV champions can even make a business selling credits to heavy emitters. Tesla, for example, sold Italy's FCA European and U.S. CO2 credits worth 2 billion euros from 2019 to 2021, and green credit sales helped boost its first-quarter revenue.","['DE', 'TSLA']"

I sold it for a loss, but the whole loss is not showing up on merill edge. I have since noticed this with a number of positions I have completely closed. When I called the help line, they just reiterated the wash sale rule, but it didn't resolve my question. I suppose it's possible I just don't understand the wash sale rule, but I don't think so.


Here's an example of what I am talking about: 

Day 1 - buy 10 shares of XYZ at 11$

Day 2 - buy 10 shares of XYZ at 10$

Day 3 - buy 10 shares of XYZ at 9$

Day 4 - sell all 30 shares at 5$

Actual loss:150$

Recorded loss: ~120$ (or at least less than 150$)


Why would this be the case? Shouldn't it register as the full 15$ loss? The guy in the phone said FIFO means that the first shares would be wash saled into the ones I bought later, but then shouldn't selling the later shares net me the same loss for tax purposes? Even with the wash sale rule, selling my cost basis adjusted shares as well would mean that those would record the loss, and I'd end up with the same net loss as the difference between the purchase and sell prices. As it is, my tax losses have essentially been permanently prevented, which doesn't make any sense. Can someone help me understand? Is merill wrong, or is there some nuance I don't know?

Edit: corrected the numbers.

Urban areas are getting denser and commutes are shrinking, parking and (if you own a car in a city) reparking for those short trips is a hassle. It’s no surprise that cities are seeing booming demand for alternative forms of transport. Scooters, bikes, and yes still “rideshare” as well. Lyft owns Motivate which runs e-bikes. Certainly this is only a small part of their current revenue. But I already see the bikes monopolizing infrastructure(charging stations on street corners) and they’re blowing up in popularity in my city. 

They sold their self driving tech project recently, but they still have a promising partnership with Google’s Waymo. I think they will be in the right position when/if robotaxis are a thing. 

Anyway, I like the company. They are set to be profitable by the end of Q3. They are a reopening play in the short term. They just beat expected earnings despite a driver shortage.

But the stock has taken quite the hit this week, all because the Biden admin is reigniting the gig worker debate. Nothing fundamental has changed. Look, they survived that prop 22 debate in CA because all of the part time drivers prefer the flexibility of gig work. The bureaucratic threats are overblown.

Personally, I don’t know what a target price should be. When it’s time to take profits I set a stop sell order for about -4% of the close. If it goes up then I increase to -4% of the higher close. Eventually, it’ll dip and my sell will trigger.

When to sell

1. Mistake in process or thesis, then sell immediately
2. Rebalancing, ie stocks move up relative to each other, trim
3. Competition for capital (need $ for a better stock)

Buffet discussed this when talking about how to proof against inflation, saying that the best way is to keep your investment in franchise businesses.  

There are only two types of businesses in this world - one that offers a unique product or service, with strong brand awareness and loyalty, relatively small competition leading to large flexibility in pricing, and another that offers a non unique product or service, faces stiff competition that drives prices low. 

Another important factor to look for is return on equity.

**RSI & Bollinger Bands**

a) Check overbought/oversold (high RSI and touching Upper Band)

b) Identify divergences - when the price hits a **lower low**, but the **RSI does not**, it would be considered a **bullish divergent signal**.

**Stochastics**

a) Recheck overbought/oversold

b) Look for divergences between stochastics and price: **lower low** but not lower low for Stochastics is another **bullish divergent signal**.

c) Look for crossover: %K line crosses over and above %D

**MACD** 

a) Look for the MACD crossing over and above signal line

**Volume**

a) Look for, ideally, larger than normal volume

Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['NFLX', 'WMT', 'AMZN']"

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",

There’s no way we’re going to meet these targets without a large push to nuclear, and it seems like NuScale is the furthest ahead out of the new technologies.

* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

n5z0z4,,investing,post,1620274920,"Uber investors finally see the costs of treating drivers as employees, and the stock is falling. Uber sets aside $600 million for U.K. drivers as a result of court findinghttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-investors-finally-see-the-costs-of-treating-drivers-as-employees-and-the-stock-is-falling-11620265604

Uber Technologies Inc. has spent and fought to keep its drivers from becoming classified as employees instead of contractors, and investors finally got a glimpse of the financial reasons on Wednesday.

Uber UBER, -3.42% broke out $600 million from its total revenue of $3.5 billion to account “for the resolution of historical claims in the U.K. relating to the classification of drivers” in its first-quarter earnings results. That is a direct result of a U.K. Supreme Court ruling in March that led Uber to classify tens of thousands of drivers in the U.K. as employees.

Uber disclosed in March that it could have to pay claims of back pay due from British drivers in the case, including holiday pay, wages to equal the minimum and, potentially, pension contributions. That would be on top of what the company already paid the drivers in the 2016 case.

That puts a dollar figure on a longstanding concern about Uber and the other “gig work” companies — what it would look like financially if they had to treat drivers as employees. And it is nothing to sneeze at, blowing away the $200 million Uber and other gig companies spent to pass a new law in California in their quest for a “third way” for employment law. That win could be moot, though, as President Joe Biden’s new secretary of the Labor Department said last week drivers should receive the benefits of employment in most cases, spooking some investors.

For more: Here is how the Biden administration could change gig work

Uber shares initially went higher in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company papered over the “accrual” and continuing losses with the $1.6 billion sale of its self-driving unit, but fell back to a 4.8% decline in the extended session as executives discussed increasing costs for drivers and faced an immediate question about Labor Secretary Marty Walsh’s comments.

“When we look at the makeup of the current administration, it’s fair to say that there are individuals who have varying views on these issues. They’re not all identical in their outlook. And we think that creates space for some meaningful dialogue,” said Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West, who worked in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama.

The company’s standard mantra when asked about the possible costs of classifying its drivers as employees has been to say that they will pass on the costs to its users, which executives said again during Wednesday’s call. They noted that they did see a slight increase in costs in the quarter, because of driver benefits, and they were able to pass those costs on to riders, with no impact on demand.

See also: Uber and Lyft are public, so the cheap rides are coming to an end

“We are leaning in, with investments to support the recovery mobility and growth initiatives and delivery,” said Uber Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, noting that the ride-hailing company plans to invest in its driver base, and increase its spending in general, marketing and administrative costs, and in R&D. Chai estimated Uber will spend between $450 million and $480 million in the second quarter, after a drop in spending last quarter. Also included will be spending on marketing to attract new drivers, as it faces driver shortages in the U.S. and Mexico.

At the same time, Chai noted that the company continues to face “significant forecasting uncertainty and predicting posts reopening consumer behavior.”

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said that investors were not happy with the higher spending, and pointed to the U.K. charge/accrual as highlighting the hot-button issue of possible further regulation over the classification of its drivers.

“Higher level of investments near term, coupled with some uncertainty around the forecast,” were affecting the shares in after-hours trading, Ives said in an email. “It was a robust print, but after the Biden move against gig players, the Street is very nervous around Uber and Lyft, with selling post-quarter a theme commonplace during tech earnings season.”

Even so, investors now have an idea of how much drivers being classified as employees could cost the company. As the debate over gig workers continues, investors will likely remain jittery about the issue. The nagging question above all is, will companies like Uber and Lyft Inc. LYFT, -6.34% ever be profitable, with their contractor business models again at risk, and prone to big, unexpected costs?",

n6klu0,,investing,post,1620343064,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

Happy investing!","['SPGI', 'YUM', 'SIVB', 'AMZN']"

(The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich.

Analysts expected Cloudflare to report a loss of 3 cents per share. Estimates called for revenue of $131 million for the period ended March 31.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

n6rgw5,,investing,post,1620366351,"Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500Hi,

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Take Amazon, which I actually think is really undervalued. The analysts that follow this company for a living are predicting 30-40% growth yoy for the next five years according to yahoo finance. I don’t see anything compelling in Amazon’s roadmap to prove them wrong. Do you have compelling data to back up your 10% yoy growth?

My thinking is that short sellers are essentially creating additional shares that regular investors are buying, meaning that there are essentially additional shares floating around in the market.

Edit: There are a couple of things you generally need to understand. Technically people can buy and sell more shares then there are in existence. Brokers have multiple ways of dealing with this topic:

1) If they are out of shares they are out of shares, that's it. 

2) A borrowing process will be started. A broker will borrow the shares of someone else to you, so your position can be created. This is how you can have a short interest beyond the floating stock/outstanding shares. If I have 100 shares in circulation but 150 shares shorted, then the short interest is 150%. Now you take the daily moving average of lets say 20 shares and this creates a number that represents how long the shorts would take to cover. For 20, that would be 7.5 days of daily average volume. This number is not that precise, because if someone shorted the stock the interest of actually keeping the share is not very high, meaning they would probably just close their position instead. Doing that will ""unlock"" the share that the broker is holding to fulfill the contract and the next one can close his position, but now at a higher price.

Note that outstanding shares can't exceed issues shares. But there can be more position on a stock than existing shares, due to borrowing - but this is insanely rare that it happens.",
n6822k,,investing,post,1620309974,"What Are Your PPE Manufacturer Plays? Tech earnings are receiving all the hype recently, and if you guys are like me, you’re looking for stocks to get into at low prices, and ride out the growth (we’re all aiming for the next TSLA). While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.","['TSLA', 'MMM']"

n69kpo,,investing,post,1620314048,"Long term expectations of Berkshire growthI have been thinking about his comments on the succession that were made public last week. His comments on leaving money to his wife in the SP500 instead of Berkshire seem interesting to me. I imagine most of his money is currently in Berkshire. He nearly always says that he thinks Berkshire is amazing and that index funds are great for most people. If he believed in Berkshire's future once he and Charlie are no longer at the helm, wouldn't it make more sense to leave her the money within Berkshire?

Based on this, does it make sense to invest in Berkshire for the long term based on his comments versus an index fund?

Edit: fixed some grammar and framing to be more clear",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['SPGI', 'BRK.B', 'KO']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx62vky,investing,comment,1620319497,"I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN']"

n6dntx,gx6vsvo,investing,comment,1620331436,"Valuing a company is always personal, it is about what and where you see the company going in your eyes and then transforming this into numbers.

Now you talk about valuing a company, FCF and market ratios in the same sentence, but market ratios refer to what the market values a company at, and that is already reflected in the stock price (pricing).

So do you want to price your company or value it (intrinsic value)? And to me it sounds like you want somebody else to do that for you (asking for a tool), but keep in mind that valuations reflect personal projections and can vary heavily based on whoever or whatever valued it.

If you want to actually learn how to value young/growth companies yourself, then I suggest this:

Physical silver jumps out to me as the most obvious choice given its longstanding use in wealth preservation. I am considering purchasing PSLV as a means to “hold” physical silver without actually possessing physical silver - it seems to track with the value of physical silver as opposed to SLV, and it has actual physical silver backing it.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on this strategy and the optimal means of purchasing physical silver, gold, or other inflation-resistant metals.",

>  
>The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”  
>

>**Consumers should immediately stop using the treadmills and** [**contact Peloton for a full refund**](https://www.onepeloton.com/)**.**  
>  
>**The Peloton Tread+ (previously named the Peloton Tread) has been on the market since 2018. A smaller treadmill, also named the Peloton Tread, was slated to go on sale May 27, with 1,000 units already sold in the U.S. as part of a friends-and-family presale.**   
>  
>The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
>  
>**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
>  
>In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.

Foley advised consumers to “keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times” and to “remove the safety key and store it out of reach of children” when the treadmill was not in use.

>**As the CPSC investigated the reports, including disturbing** [**home video footage of a child being sucked underneath the Peloton Tread+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) **(and escaping without serious injury), the agency asked Peloton to recall its treadmills. But Peloton refused.**  
>  
>Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
>  
>The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
>  
>“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
>  
>Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
>  
>**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families.

We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”**

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

\- Maybe a comparable to analyze its growth against another company either in the same or adjacent segment.

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

n5yd5o,,investing,post,1620272502,"Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?Hi r/investing,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

Since I am new to value investing, am I missing something here? Or, is this a good pick to buy-and-hold?","['PEG', 'TSLA']"
n5yd5o,gx5iiqs,investing,comment,1620310822,"Approving the comment but with some guidance:  Even though the stock is undervalued, I encourage you to come to the table with a more thorough analysis.  A thorough discussion of valuation is going to do more than look at various ratios of earnings.  For example:

1. What's the FCF-based fair value?
2. What's the delta of Ford's forward P/E in each of the past five quarters to its actual P/E?  In other words, how much did positive earnings materialize into stock price appreciation?
3. What is the historical and forward P/E comparison to Ford's peers?  The automotive industry is exceptionally capital intensive with not staggeringly high margins.
4. What are the risk factors unique to the automotive industry?  Investors have been as shy of automotive stocks as they have been of airline stocks, two industries that required a LOT of public subsidy over the past five decades, and are now facing a transformation challenge: spurred on by the $2 billion settlement of VW AG over its emissions scandals, automotive makers have an incentive to convert their production to EV's but at what cost?  Is Ford ahead or behind its peers in this regard?
5. There's not a lot in their financial statements that looks glaringly bad (some commentary on non cash items, discontinued operations and capital lease obligations is welcome but not materially significant) but a few things should be at least commented on including that three of the past five quarters they posted a net operating loss... Granted, that owes to the pandemic but when we look at history, even before the pandemic the stock price never rose above $14 per share and hovered for quite a while around $10, currently trading at $11.5399.  So the market's not really moved the price even remotely close to the FCF fair value in the last half decade... What implications might that have for the expected return?  That may or may not matter depending on the type of value investor you're pitching the question to, but it's got to be addressed so they can weigh it.

There are, I'm sure, many other questions that can be raised if given more than the five or six minutes I glanced at the company's data... This is just an example of the kind of questions you should anticipate.",

Don’t Just Blame Poor Earnings.""The stock has been under pressure for the past few months since the firm signaled that it [expects little membership growth in 2021](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teladoc-stock-falls-on-downbeat-forecast-for-membership-51614267007?mod=article_inline). A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

n5w1a9,,investing,post,1620264703,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DDVista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",

n5lead,,investing,post,1620235477,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor  
**Resolution 2:** I made 3 copies of the sheet in hopes of spreading out the odds of getting in

3. **Resolution 3:** I published them to the web for those that can't get into the files themselves

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

Or am I missing something else entirely?",['ES']

n5jbxh,gx1mkfe,investing,comment,1620233029,"If you buy ETFs financed with margin or box spreads, you could realize losses to prevent the leverage ratio increasing over your target. I know you said you did not want to realize losses, but you could use the losses to realize gains (and step up your bases) by selling and buying similar but not equivalent ETFs to make sure those losses are not wasted.

Now might not be the best time to start a leveraged portfolio combining stocks+bonds. The portfolio works best when stocks and bonds are negatively correlated - we have flight to safety to bonds when stocks drop, we have a Fed dropping rates when things are scary, and we have minimal inflation (which may cause stocks and bonds to be positively correlated). Right now inflation may be a risk and the Fed may not have room to drop rates any lower. Any thoughts on this?

n4m397,,investing,post,1620128014,"Persistent high inflation won't happenThe Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

That will make your position almost delta neutral and protect against any downside because if SPY is down by 10 points, your unrealised gain on SPY is 10*50= 500 USD.
This will also mean MES contracts  (which is 5*future value of SPX) will have fallen by 100 points. That will mean MES contract has gained about 500  USD

Stock futures are mostly flat this morning. Tech is seeing a bit of selling, with the Nasdaq off 0.3%.

This follows a day of reopening optimism that lifted retail stocks. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will fully re-open on May 19. Florida is open effective immediately.

So the rotation trade is apparently back. Not much in the way of economic data today. Factory orders at 0830. We do have a bunch of earnings: CVS and DuPont just beat. Later we have Pfizer, Activision Blizzard, Akamai, and some oil majors: ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum, Dominion Energy, Devon Energy. 

Oil is up this morning, by the way. Crude up 1.8% to $65.50, another post-pandemic high.

I'm currently a 26 y/o engineer based in the Bay Area with a $160k salary. I currently have about 250k saved among my 401k (\~82k), Roth IRA (\~13k), and Brokerage account (\~155k). My 401k is all in on FXIAX, and my IRA is all in on VTSAX. My Brokerage is split 80% VTSAX, 20% VTIAX, and I'm consistently adding about 3k per month at this split to my account. My goal is to eventually buy a home in the Bay Area, which can be very expensive. Not sure when I'd like to make such a purchase, but I'm thinking within the next 5 years. I would also like to retire early if possible (no set age in mind).

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?","['SPGI', 'DIS', 'UNP', 'HD', 'UNH', 'ADBE', 'NKE', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'HON', 'MSFT', 'NFLX', 'NVDA', 'TGT', 'DHR', 'TMO', 'AMZN']"

However most etfs are priced higher than $60. The reason I have seen in the past is lower bid/ask.

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

What puts most between $60-400.

I may have mis interpreted the question I was just discussing share price not NAV",['SPGI']

The tl;dr is that the price of an ETF is determined by the market. However, there are certain “authorised participants” that can exchange shares in the ETF to a portfolio of shares that comprise the ETF, and vice versa. This means that the price of the ETF can never deviate too far from the value implied by prices of the underlying shares.",
n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['AMD', 'INTC', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'IP']"

I originally bought it a year ago (thanks to a small windfall) to diversify and hedge during the Covid panic, following the saying be greedy when others are fearful.

Overall, the portfolio was up 0.24% for the week. This was mainly driven by our commodity trend allocation. The SPY was -0.11% while the TLT was -0.21%. Overall the portfolio outperformed the 60/40 during Week 1.

That being said, I received a lot of feedback on the original post. Namely, the portfolio was far too conservative to be able to grow at the expected 15% over time. 

I went back and look at Chris Cole's specific recommendation. It does appear he goes higher weight equities than we had originally allocated. Additionally, he uses leverage to achieve the target portfolio volatility of 15%. I was curious how this would work, so I ran some backtests using 3x leveraged ETFs for TLT, GLD and SPY. This backtesting is not perfect because we don't have a volatility component, but it proved to me you can get higher returns than the traditional 60/40 portfolio by using leverage.

* [Backtest Allocation](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAlZZPa)
* [Backtest Performance](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdUVQZh)
* [Backtesting Website](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio)

Going forward, I will reallocate our Retail Dragon Portfolio to the following:

* 24% SPXL - 3x S&P 500 ETF
* 18% UGLD - 3x Gold ETF
* 18% TYD  - 3x Long Duration Government Bond ETF
* 3% IWM Straddle - This represents 3x volatility component we were previously long. The goal is to match the leverage we are using in the other allocations.
* 36% GNR - GNR is a commodity producer ETF that tracks the S&P Global Natural Resource Index. I am treating this as a semi-leveraged play on commodities as we would expect the producers to outperform pure commodity plays. However, there is no leveraged ETF we can follow on this basket, so we are simply assigning double the portfolio weight. My thinking goes we have leverage from the producers. When combined with a 2x weight, we create an equivalent of ~3x leverage we have on our other allocations.

A note on Commodity Trend. There were many questions on Commodity Trend from the original post. Many people thought we were simply long commodities. This is not the case. The goal of this allocation is to be short or long depending on a trend following technique. For this portfolio, we plan to follow a simple 40/50 Moving Average cross over technique. Long when it's the 40 day moving average is higher. Short when the 50 day moving average is higher. You are free to use your own trend following technique if you want to customize our approach. The goal of this allocation is to capture the large moves commodities tend to have during periods of financial stress or strong recovery. For example, look at NYSE: TECK from 2007 to 2011. Imagine if you had a strategy that would benefit from going short on the downside AND long on the upside. This would have helped your portfolio out greatly even as equities and gold were performing poorly.

I will implement this when markets open Monday and will be tracking the new portfolio from scratch.

I look forward to hearing any comments or feedback on this approach moving forward.",['SPGI']

When we are talking about the performance of one investment, then IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is the proper metric.

Averages without the context of median, mode, and standard deviation, don't tell you anything meaningful about portfolio performance, especially because they conceal the impact of compounding principal and you can't then use that rate of return in a Time Value of Money equation to project future performance.

Likewise, whatever benchmark index you compare to, you should be comparing to the CAGR of that index over the same period.",

For Evart, a small American town in Michigan, these blurry lines are clear. As a provider of water for Nestlé, Evart serves as an example of a community-corporation agreement. The result of which, means Nestlé purchases and uses Evart’s water sources for private use – what some might recognise on the market today as Ice Mountain bottled water.

Challenges arise, however, within the terms of that deal. Having purchased rights to Evart’s water supply, Nestlé is free to pump out large amounts of water at a high volume – 250 gallons per minute, to be exact. And at a relatively cheap price: paying $200 a year to the community, Nestlé can pump 130 million gallons of water annually and sell that water for profit. This is all done in spite of the fact that unprecedented water pumping contributes to the degradation of Evart’s local wells, whilst also affecting the water supply actually available to locals. 

For some in the community, Nestlé’s promises of new factories in Evart and the fact that they bought the water in the first place, is enough of a positive. For others, Nestlé’s presence has sparked outrage within the Evart community, leading to some uniting as a non-profit organisation known as Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation.

n44y45,gwtm292,investing,comment,1620071767,"There's a lot of regulatory / political uncertainty surrounding GEO and the prison space right now. The Biden executive order has directed the DOJ to cease use of private facilities which is acting as a headwind to revenue and contract renewal rates. Losing the Bureau of Prison business via the executive order isn't that big of a deal, but it does represent ~$290MM of revenue rolling off between now and FYE2022. More concerning, however, was having the contract with the US Marshals canceled at the GEO Queens facility as this customer was viewed as far more sticky than the BOP. Losing the BOP revenue was always a matter of ""when"", not ""if"", but potentially losing the USMS in addition means GEO investors need to diligence how the company will navigate losing two of its top three customers.

Increasing chatter of reform at ICE layers in additional concerns as this is their largest customer, though it isn't clear to me how the USMS and ICE will rapidly move away from the industry with any degree of efficiency, particularly as COVID impacts on prison and ICE populations abate. While the asset value at GEO is robust, keep in mind there is limited use for these assets. A prison can't be converted into a shopping mall or a bowling alley, for example, and at GEO you have a lot of debt ahead the equity that would be paid out first in the event of a liquidation. While it likely makes sense for the government to solve the prison prison ""problem"" by buying these assets for public use given the constraints in the government prison system, for political reasons this may not happen.

Add on top of all of this is GEO's limited ability to tap capital markets due to ESG concerns (though this is a constantly moving line) + GEO's 2024 maturity wall and it doesn't strike me as a great equity story. Limited paths for growth, regulatory concerns, questionable access to capital, refi risk, etc, etc. Eliminating the dividend was a good first step but long over due. Given yield on GEO's debt I would prefer to buy the near term bonds than the equity.

Personally I like CoreCivic better than GEO. Less leverage, better story, less BOP risk, but neither strikes me as a compelling equity opportunity.

TLDR: tough equity story; this is not a ""down the fairway"" stock as it is borderline distressed; lots of revenue is rolling off and even more is at risk of rolling off in the future rendering current P/E metrics rather useless; limited opportunities for growth in general as prison populations have been in decline for years now",['ICE']

n3boe2,,investing,post,1619977476,"Ellsberg Paradox: Was Value Once Seen As More Volatile Than Growth?Currently reading Jason Zweig’s Your Money and Your Brain (2007) and this sounded a little backwards when I first read it. It doesn’t make as much sense out of context, but when explaining the connection between the Ellsberg Paradox and your investment decisions, he concluded with this:

“All this makes investing in value stocks or small stocks the equivalent of trying to pick a black ball from Urn B: The higher ambiguity makes your odds of success feel less certain. Picking from the “predictable” growth stocks in Urn A simply feels safer. So most investors steer clear of value companies and small stocks, driving their share prices down, and pile into big growth companies, sending their stocks soaring - at least in the short run. Over longer periods, however, growth stocks and the stocks most popular with analysts tend to earn lower returns than value stocks and underanalyzed companies. By avoiding stocks that are high in ambiguity, the investing public makes them underperform in the short run - creating bargains that go on to outperform over the long run.”

For more clarity, the Ellsberg Paradox is a choice between two urns in front of you for a chance to win $100. You can’t see inside either urn. Each urn contains 100 balls. Urn A contains exactly 50 red balls and 50 black balls. Urn B contains exactly 100 balls; some of which are red and some are black, but you do not know how many there are of each. You win the $100 if you choose a red ball. Which urn do you choose from? Links would have been included here if I weren’t posting from mobile.

The reason many have largely (blindly) done that is because they feel *safety* in the steady growth that is expected in those markets. Meanwhile, to stay in the same thread, a value stock like an oil company would be seen as high risk because of the very large *risk* of not continuing to grow.",
n3boe2,gws2rs8,investing,comment,1620047956,"Value stocks tend to have higher historical volatility because they often go through some decline to reach a low valuation. Typically value stocks are in disfavor or crisis. 

But they don’t necessarily have higher forward volatility. The relative difference depends on how you define growth and what your time horizon is. 

I think in Zweig’s context he’s saying that when you look at the universe of stocks, value will appear to be more risky because of higher recent historical volatility, poor recent historical returns, and likely current signs of crisis or market decline. Particularly when compared to companies currently in favor with recent history of strong returns, profits, and strong market growth.

Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary.

Why not!? If you think inflation is going to keep climbing I don't see how the 30 year yield can remain low. 3% doesn't even represent a normal level of term spread even at low inflation levels. If inflation remains stable or continues to increase the 30 year yield has to continue going up just to maintain a positive expected return much less keep up with historical term spread.",

Well Powell keeps saying transitory rather than temporary because temporary implies it does away. Transitory means it is a one time bump. Once inflated the Fed and the treasury do not expect a decline in prices but lower future inflation.

I've been in gold and silver since last spring/summer. I don't think it will rise that much due to alternatives like crypto (which I sadly did not buy into last spring/summer), the strength of equities, and how bullish economies coming out of a recession tend for boom industrial materials/metals rather than defensive ones like silver/gold.

n2iz5s,gwkzqu1,investing,comment,1619901252,"You should not mix the idea of an emergency fund and a dry powder fund. What if the market shifts, you put your dry powder in, and get a cancer diagnosis / lose your job / meteorite obliterates your house the next day? They need to be two completely independent piles of money.

I have my emergency ""oh shit"" money in a very boring savings account that I can access through my bank or ATM this instant.

I have a dry powder MM fund in both my taxable brokerage and in my IRAs, and I try to maintain some cash in them to take advantage of black swan events. Last March when the pandemic hit and WTI went negative I made a big move into USL that paid off handsomely.

How much you have in long term investments vs. how much you keep as dry powder really is up to individual temperament. Dry powder may not earn you much, but might be invaluable in taking advantage of black swan events. At the same time, if those black swan events don't come, that cash may be sitting in a MM earning fuck all. 

TL;DR - I was happy to have a shitload of cash available to take advantage of shifts due to the pandemic, but now we're back to ""normal"", everyone needs to make a personal judgement on how much powder to hold in cash/MM. This is NOT my emergency ""oh shit"" money, which is safe as hell and immediately accessible.",

n2fchi,,investing,post,1619863183,"Not a single one of you are able to argue why “growth will collapse”Reading through this sub you get the feeling that everyone “knows” it but no one is exactly giving a single reason for why, other than “it should because of high valuations”.

It reads as a lot of wishful thinking and arrogance. Where the hell do you place Apple, the largest company in the world growing 50%?  

Growth has outperformed value for 20 years, and the winners of the dot com crash , like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, have outperformed everything by a huge margin in the last 30 years. 

Either the valuation methods were good to use and it’s just that the type of company that wins the future has so much higher margins and network effects that the definition of key value metrics has to change, OR (like many here seem to suggest), somehow this will all “regress to the mean” and somehow Sysco, public enterprise group, and Cincinnati Financial (great companies I also own) will eventually outperform the other ones I mention?

It has nothing to do with finance and everything to do with business model. If you can’t understand how business has changed finance, then you will continue to underperform by relying on outdated financial discipline viewpoints.","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'CINF', 'SYY', 'AMZN']"
n2fchi,gwj4qzf,investing,comment,1619869196,"Someone said this in 2011 about John Hussman: ""**Conflating his views of what should happen with what could happen.** He is the anti-David Tepper, **more concerned with the the violated rules of the game than with winning the game itself**."" (https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/The-Reformed-Broker/2011/0112/Mutual-fund-manager-apologizes-kind-of) This was in 2011 after Hussman spent the prior couple of years fighting the Fed and talking about how everything was a bubble. He then spent nearly the next 10 years fighting the fed (to the point of doing a petition against what the Fed was doing - in 2020: https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/john-hussman-is-literally-fighting-the-fed/a1376170) 

I think there are people who view growth with some degree of disdain, have this belief that ""anything above (fill in random low # p/e) is bubble/overvalued/etc"" and then they get upset/frustrated when those names go up for years on end (remaining too focused on all the reasons why they shouldn't and meanwhile, not focused on why they could and did.) For all their dislike and disinterest in investing in growth, they still manage to seem to be consistent and eager spectators and have an opinion on all the most popular names. 

If you are a ""value investor"" (unless you run a value fund, I don't know why you feel you have to strictly be a ""value investor"") it's been a frustrating decade topped off with the fact that in a pandemic aggressive growth had probably its best year since the dot com era, outperforming value (which one would have thought would have provided shelter from the storm, yet underperformed in the initial decline in March 2020 and then massively underperformed in the months after.)

That said, growth can absolutely become very frothy and I think did last year - it was completely a year of ""the more aggressive the growth story the better."" The kind of performance that aggressive growth had last year was in no way sustainable unless ""this time is very different."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly)

 Ultra low rates and an eagerness to chase anything ""disruptive"" lead to a year that probably won't be repeated any time soon. People invested in EVs like all the companies were going to be winners (https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html), despite the fact that the automobile industry has a very, very, very (very) long list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) of losers in its history. People were investing in shroom stocks as if shrooms were going to be in every produce section tomorrow. Battery company that wasn't going to have a product until 2025 bought up...until reality hits (and then on top of that it's called a fraud.) I think people get overly excited about a theme and then it's buy anything related at any price. Might still actually be a good long-term theme but where you bought it still matters: if you buy into short-term mania, you could still be a bagholder for a while when reality returns. 

The Ark ""collect 'em all"" posts got excessive and people calling Cathy Wood ""Money Tree"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree) might have been the top before the correction in Feb in Ark-y aggressive growth. Many growth names corrected significantly or very significantly in Feb-Mar, and it's interesting to see what's bounced and what has not as perhaps people have become more selective. If you see another ramp higher in rates, growth will pull back again. Will ""growth collapse""? I don't think so. Will nonsense eventually crater and excess cool off? Yes. Not everything in growth is in some sort of massive, speculative excess, although people like to paint it that way.

If you're still positioned for what did exceedingly well in 2020, you're probably not going to do as well in 2021. I don't think that things are going back to 2019 normal - covid seems as if it will be endemic so I think people have to invest in this sort of ""in-between"" where it's not the worst of the pandemic but a return to 2019 or close to it might be a long ways off. I think people should consider having a portion of their portfolio dedicated to a selected group of aggressive growth names they feel strongest about and a portion dedicated to higher quality - not necessarily boring/conservative, but slower, high quality growth that has demonstrated consistent results over the years. Real assets/inflation beneficiaries should also be considered.

This isn't ""anti-value"", although I think traditional value investing I think is very difficult in a world that seems to be increasingly focused on ""why is my stock down 1% in the last hour?!?!"", it's more: understand your strengths, don't create a lot of arbitrary rules (""Anything with p/e above 15 is too expensive"") - have some flexibility and give yourself a broad mandate so that you can be able to look for the broadest set of potential opportunities.",

High valuations *are* a good reason to expect lower future returns. Over the past decade, AAPL and MSFT have delivered excellent returns, but a significant part of those returns came from multiple expansion. That’s unlikely to repeat, and if interest rates rise, multiples will contract significantly. 

A decade ago, AAPL and MSFT *were* value stocks. People considered AAPL’s business model to be heavily reliant on the iPhone and it sold at a low P/E typical of a hardware manufacturer. MSFT was considered a dinosaur. Few were bullish on them like they are now.

Growth companies, *provided they’re purchased at a sensible price*, can absolutely deliver high returns.

1) Trends and market darlings die hard. So even if a company is overvalued, the most important aspect is that the brand is recognizable and so people are going to invest or do business with it. That means that if you buy in there is very likely to still be upswing left even if the company is somehow making all the wrong management decisions. So growth works even if you're late to the bandwagon.

2) Picking a value stock is like picking a favorite horse or home nfl draft dream team. Sure, on paper, everything may be perfectly aligned, but (repeat after me) the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. And sure P/E ratios and long views help, but you're still ultimately gambling that the crowd will eventually come to the same conclusion that you did to see any really strong uplift. And frankly, it's just hard to pick diamonds in the rough.

3) Look at any growth vs value comparison chart of the last 20 or so years and yes growth outperforms value, but they both track each other pretty well in the up markets. It's in the brief downturns where you see values greatly outperform growth, which again, I think is a logical outcome since everyone is panicking. So even though it wins the minority of the time, it wins when everyone is freaking out and so it gets this reputation as tried and true, default advice.",
n1z80f,,investing,post,1619804740,"This Barron's article might explain Tesla's sudden surge today: Tesla Stock Turns Higher Because Sales and Deliveries May Blow Away Estimates[https://www.barrons.com/articles/earnings-lift-restaurant-brands-its-ceo-says-its-a-post-pandemic-growth-story-51619801175](https://www.barrons.com/articles/earnings-lift-restaurant-brands-its-ceo-says-its-a-post-pandemic-growth-story-51619801175)  


A wave of pessimism that has hurt  [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA)  stock in recent days may be starting to recede. 

Stock in the [electric-vehicle](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-could-save-the-auto-business-by-disrupting-it-heres-how-51614442967?mod=article_inline)  pioneer was on its way to a fourth consecutive daily decline when the  shares turned around in midday trading Friday. Two factors—both related  to 2021 performance—may be making investors more upbeat heading into  May.  

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock started out the week at about $729  and closed Monday at $738.20, ahead of the company’s first-quarter [earnings report](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-ticked-all-the-boxes-big-questions-remain-51619469933?mod=article_inline) that afternoon. Earnings were higher than Wall Street expected, but questions about the [quality](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-earnings-were-a-gift-to-doubters-a-fine-result-wasnt-good-enough-51619539342?mod=article_inline)  of the reported earnings—the degree to which trading in Bitcoin and  sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission cars lifted the  number–sent the stock lower. [Lingering concern](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-headline-headaches-wall-street-weighs-in-51619449789?mod=article_inline) over a recent crash of a Tesla vehicle in Texas dragged on the price too.  

The  stock opened Friday at about $668, $71 lower than Monday’s close, and  down 1.4% from Thursday’s final level. By early afternoon, though,  shares were up about $43, or 6.5%,  from the daily low, at $709.55. The  [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX)  and  [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/DJIA), for comparison, were each down about 0.6%.  

The  stock-price bounce might just be a relief rally marking the end of the  post-earnings selling spree. But two bits of news, both communicated via [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), appear to be at work as well.    

New Street Research analyst [Pierre Ferragu](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-can-hit-1-200-analyst-says-51602108860?mod=article_inline) tweeted out Thursday that  [STMicroelectronics](https://www.barrons.com/quote/STM) (STM) believes its revenues from sales of silicon carbide will  hit $550 million in 2021. The company said as much on its April 29  earnings conference call. 

It matters because according to  Ferragu, STMicro is Tesla’s sole supplier of silicon carbide,. He says  Tesla accounts for 80% of the company’s silicon-carbide sales, and that  sales of $550 million imply Tesla would produce as many as 1 million  vehicles.  

Wall Street is looking for 800,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021. A million vehicles would be an enormous surprise. 

[Gary Black](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nikola-stock-tesla-electric-trucks-manufacturing-hydrogen-elon-musk-trevor-milton-gary-black-51591908953?mod=article_inline), an influential market watcher, also tweeted out something he uncovered in Tesla’s [recent 10-Q](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-notes-a-new-risk-quarterly-report-51619640537?mod=article_inline) quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In the filing, Black noted, Tesla’s board of directors said it  is “probable” that Tesla’s annualized sales will hit $55 billion, a  milestone that would trigger the grant of stock options to CEO        Elon Musk.        

Wall Street analysts believe Tesla’s 2021 sales will be  less than $50 billion, so a figure of $55 billion would be a second  enormous surprise for investors. 

Black  is a former Wall Street analyst and money manager who has amassed  almost 74,000 followers tweeting about stocks, including Tesla. Ferragu,  for his part, rates Tesla share at Buy and has a $900 price target for  the stock.","['SPGI', 'TWTR', 'TSLA', 'DOW']"

The Fed remains dovish, and in spite of its transitory speak about inflation, prices continue to soar. Biden calls for even more stimulus, but it’s doubtful all of it will make it through the Senate. Meanwhile, the parameters for Gold  and silver  remain the same. Resistance is at 1800 and support is at 1740-50. 25,60 silver 
Yields are rising again
Real yields are flat to lower recently, supporting Gold’s move off its lows. While Powell says rising inflation is temporary, all evidence is to the contrary. While yields cannot be allowed to get out of hand and risk the collapse of everything, inflation will continue to rise as the printing presses remain plugged in and supply chains break down. This is the foundation for the coming surge in precious metals. I don’t see the 30-Year T-Bond going beyond the 2.75-3.00% resistance zone.

I wish I had more to say , but who wants to hear a running post on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, and given the long slow grind lower following the slingshot to 2100 in Goldand 40 silver , I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",

n1zsic,,investing,post,1619806290,"Ford Needs to Rethink Their StrategyThis is just a short commentary on the potential Ford has and how they are wasting it.

Yesterday, Ford released their Q1 results, forward guidance, and plans for the future. Due mostly to the lacklustre guidance, the stock dipped >10%. Investment strategy aside, I believe the single biggest takeaway from Ford's report was their plan for the future.

While I'm a big fan of CEO Jim Farley, and his plan to make Ford a more focused (pun not intended) and lean company, I feel like he is focusing more on paths to a higher temporary stock price rather than proper long term investment.

To Ford and its management's credit, I do think they are attempting long-term investments, I just believe they are the wrong ones; Ford is investing heavily in electrification and autonomous driving, however, neither of those are sufficiently monetizable and are extremely capital intensive. Additionally, they are investing over a billion dollars for a factory in Cologne, Germany and streamlining the factory process. 

Expanding on my aforementioned comments, investing in autonomous technologies will not yield Ford any significant reward- they are too behind competitors, it's complex and capital intensive, and it would be just as simple for Ford to partner with, say, Waymo.

On the same wavelength, I believe Ford should increase their equity stake in Rivian and use their electric innovations rather than attempting to spend billions on developing their own. On the topic of electrification, Ford should not be attempting to electrify their core lineup of pickups and Mustang's first. It undermines the fundamental principles of both for the time being. Instead, electrification is best suited to the luxury segment of the automotive market- Lincoln for Ford. Electrifying the Lincoln brand could kill multiple birds with one stone, testing EV technology, revitalizing the Lincoln brand, helping increase margins, spending less on analog technology to do things like quiet the vehicles, and so forth.

Additionally, handing over control of their software to Google is a big mistake- it eliminates the prospect of extracting monetization from their vehicle, which will be a large aspect of vehicles and will allow competitors to undercut Ford by selling at a loss to extract later value, contrary to what Ford will be able to do.

A large issue for Ford when attempting to streamline their lineup and manufacturing process is potentially breaching union contracts by cutting staff- opening a factory in one of the most union-friendly countries in the world isn't helping that. The additional tariffs and whatnot for manufacturing less in the EU would be more than compensated with a more nimble organization. In fact, I'm a proponent of completely pulling the Ford brand out of Europe, which would aid in stressing the 'Americanness' of the brand, where Ford gets much of its appeal in the States. Additionally, once debt is paid down (more on that later), Ford should be working to slowly exit Detroit and expand its manufacturing clout in more business-friendly, union-hostile environments, such as Texas or the Midwest. Not only would this increase Ford's bottom line and transform them into a more agile corporation, but this will also enable greater employment in more states, meaning more lobbying power. 

Above all else, though, Ford should be focusing on paying down or buying back their debts- it's too much of a drag on long-term growth and investment ability. To do so, they should cut their dividend alongside other cost-saving strategies I've outlined.

After the debt is better managed, some key investments Ford should go for are investments in monetizable software, a reintroduction into the sports car foray (Thunderbird, anyone?), new factories in anti-union states, vertical integration of the manufacturing process (and focus on selling parts B2B), expanding their niche commercial operations (such as with police cars currently, they could expand into delivery and so forth), expansion of the high margin Ford Credit, lobbying to be allowed to cut out dealerships as Tesla has, and so forth.

&#x200B;

Essentially:

* Increase stake in Rivian and use them to electrify (Lincoln first)
* Partner with a third party to integrate current autonomous operations
* Divest from Detroit and other union-friendly areas to become a more nimble organization
* Cut debt, dividends, etc.
* Double down on successful sub-sectors

&#x200B;

Ford is in a position to do great things, while Farley & Co. have improved the company, there is so much more to do that they are ignoring. Obviously, there are subjects I am not aware of, however, from what I've read through their presentation, Q1 report, and 10-Q, these are some things that should be done.

n1ttyy,,investing,post,1619789266,"$NAPA - Valued at a discountI came across this stock via a low PE screener and realized that I am already familiar with many of their products. They're in the alcoholic beverages industry, own vineyards, and produce a wide portfolio of wine brands sold in 50 countries. I'm a big fan of Decoy for producing cheaply priced but great tasting reds. 

They had their IPO last month and their price seems to be stabilizing after yoyoing between $16-20. Facts:

* Market Cap: $2.1b
* Shares: $18.58
* PEG: 0.01
* **PE: 0.04**

This seems like an absolute steal. Competitors in the beverages industry have an average PE of 32.5 and PEG of 0.05 (per TD Ameritrade analytics, anyway). Its a profitable company that has great margins.

The primary downside is their tiny market share in a competitive industry. In 2020, their total revenue was $270mil, versus the industry total of $326**bil** (0.08%). 

What else am I missing? Why is $NAPA valued at such a discount?

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",
n1mz3k,gwec7a6,investing,comment,1619766578,"If you are seeking to construct a long short portfolio from scratch using single equities, be very careful. You have to consider much more than just “percent weighted.” There are other variables at play. So to answer your questions:
1. A long short portfolio WILL NOT equally weight holdings
2. Risk exposure is absolutely key. It will make or break you. It can turn a $2 MIL portfolio into a margin call in the blink of an eye depending on some very important factors like: your volatility exposure; portfolio correlation to your pre-chosen underlying index; and lastly, you MUST allow some form of short selling and be okay with it. You also need to construct a rolling beta and rolling R - squared that will analyze how your equities’ systematic risk changes over time.  
3. If you are long and short, you are naturally hedging. Keep in mind that your systematic risk exposure is the key to navigating your bear and bull market. Now, if you are looking for more of a bullish long short approach, you’ll want to find companies that can maintain sales, a steady operating margin, and have a diversified revenue stream. Keep in mind that nearly a lot popularly bought index funds are “technically” overvalued, so this may or may not be working for or against your preferred style of investment.

Invest at your own risk. The above scenario is incredibly risky and a slight deviation in your math will bankrupt your account, but if correct, it’s a big payday and scaleable with a ton of margin if you choose that risk.",
n1mz3k,gwe9dph,investing,comment,1619764211,"Short interest is extremely low after pretty big blowups in GME and TSLA. Ironically this probably sets up a good entry to short bubble stocks, of which there are plenty. Be careful of ones with weekly expiries and high short interest; these are prone to gamma manipulation by larger players. It's a game and if there is money to be made in a short squeeze it will be done. 

There is stuff like ARKK which doesn't necessarily have 0 fundamentals but has very high valuations; SPACs which are mostly frauds (e.g. NKLA), meme stocks like MVIS and GME. Go for put spreads instead of outright shorting if you can find a good entry. 

You could go for a more balanced approach and diversify your short book. Solely from valuation you can short MSFT/APPL against long GOOG/FB and I reckon there are many more interesting pairs out there. But there is so much money on the table if the bubble stocks do burst. The call-buying from retail is slowly diminishing as the economy is reopening up; interest rates are rising and I think this is probably a good opportunity to set up some shorts if you can stomach large drawdowns (and you do need conviction to believe that stocks will trade towards their fair value over time).","['ARKK', 'TSLA', 'MSFT', 'FB']"

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52. I always hear how ""everything is overpriced!"", ""tech is too high now!"", and ""FAAMG are overvalued!!!"", but when there are discounts right here (including UBER/LYFT) and all I hear is negative betty sentiments.","['TWTR', 'IBM']"
n1bg9z,,investing,post,1619722719,"Beijing’s Squeeze on Fragile Real-Estate Developers Is Getting Real - Wall Street Journal ArticleRead the article here: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-squeeze-on-fragile-real-estate-developers-is-getting-real-11619682390](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijings-squeeze-on-fragile-real-estate-developers-is-getting-real-11619682390)

Getting completely lost in the current wild bull market is the fact that China's markets and economy have been starting to once again show cracks and signs of weakness. A lot of that is a product of the government starting to restrict their stimulus efforts in an attempt to keep the growth in debt and leverage in check. China has been the first market to really pull back stimulus, which probably isnt surprising since they were the first to be hit by and recover from Covid.

In the above linked article, there are some very.... interesting happenings relating to the Chinese property market. I don't for one second believe that China would ever purposefully burst their property bubble, since that would be a self-inflicted wound that would do a massive amount of damage.

That being said, as with any credit-fueled bubble, you tend to see these catch-22 situations pop up where regulators are forced to decide between:

1. Allowing the bubble to grow larger and larger, losing any type of control over how it behaves and worsening the fallout when the bubble inevitably bursts.
2. Clamping down on credit expansion, preventing the bubble from growing larger, but also risking being the pin that pops the bubble itself.

They seem to be going for option 2 right now. China recently tried to curb credit growth in 2018, and that played a major role in the markets that year, where both bonds and stock indexes saw a mild decline on the year. Despite the impact, China didn't even end up actually reducing the debt in the system, but just slowed the level of growth.... until Covid hit and the floodgates were once again reopened to credit growth.

Obviously, the thing to watch for is whether China can walk the tightrope of reducing leverage growth without triggering a cascading failure of the very fragile economy. One thing to keep in mind here is that China has greater ability to manage debt issues like this due to their economy not really being market-based, and the level of control the Gov't has over all the pieces in the puzzle. That's not to say that's all good - the ability to stall a forced deleveraging also means that the problems tend to metastasize quicker and to a far greater extent since the cans typically just get kicked down the road further. It's the classic moral hazard dilemma.

**Good Twitter Thread On This Article**

Quoting from Michael Pettis, who is always astute, and is a reasonably non-biased source on China's economy. [Read thread here](https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1387831939353153537).

As usual I'm especially interested in the balance-sheet impact: as long as things are going well, the shift barely matters, but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

>This process can be highly self-reinforcing as it forces property developers to cut back further on operations, and so alienate even more deposits. Of course the more developers rely on deposits to fund their operations, the more likely it is that a problem with one large developer spreads to other developers around the country. Regulators can force banks to lend, but they can't force households to put up deposits.  
>  
>Second, Beijing will have to choose either to let households take the loss or to force banks to step in and make them whole. The former seems politically unlikely, but the latter means that what had looked like a reduction in banks' exposure to real estate developers was never a meaningful reduction at all but rather the conversion of direct liabilities into contingent liabilities. For all the regulatory agitation, in other words, there was never an improvement in financial-sector risk.  
>  
>For many years we've seen that ""deleveraging"" in China has meant reducing leverage in one part of the economy while increasing it in another. This isn't incidental. It is fundamental to the way the growth model works. ""

**Some other general thoughts & notes**

* The Shanghai Composite index is down 6% in RMB terms (ASHR etf is down 13% in US markets). In general, there has been emerging weakness in Chinese indexes compared to US stock indexes. Obviously this can reverse, but it's worth noting the divergence.
* The USDCNY exchange rate reversed in February for the first time since Covid hit in any meaningful way before starting it's fall again in recent weeks. Could be a sign that a durable trend reversal is coming, which tends to signal Chinese economic weakness from a market perspective.
* China has been putting curbs on developers for a little while now ( since end of 2020) due to excessive speculation & credit growth - [read more here on some of the details](https://www.ft.com/content/5bdab1f8-3285-41ca-b964-bf3ce6b2c7fb)
* Chinese property is the primary means of savings for Chinese citizens.
* Beijing recently reduced restrictions on capital being allowed to leave their borders. This may potentially have an effect on property values and the exchange rate, although it's tough to say if and how much this will matter.

China is try to get a soft landing, and let the house market flatline for a long period of time, while letting everything else in the economy catch up. A hard landing is a nightmare scenario for the CCP for several reasons: 

* the house is where an entire generation (think people born from \~1945 until late 70s) has their net worth, having either bought houses when prices were cheap, or having got one from their employer, or from eminent domain (poor farmer families literary become millionaires in this way).
* It is also a huge retirement account for many (the idea ""using the house as retirement"", 以房养老, was flouted around few years ago), especially for those outside the public sector.
* For the younger generation, a house in a 1st tier city is the achievement of a lifetime. It often takes the ""6 wallets"" (all the life savings of the couple and their parents) for a downpayment. Letting the house price collapse is highly unnerving for them.

But construction is also a significant contributor to the Chinese economy, and employs a not-insignificant amount of people. Not to mention that most people in power have, either overtly or covertly, many properties... 

&#x200B;

>...but it matters a great deal if the developer ever gets into trouble and is unable to finish a project.

Unrelated, but unfinished houses (烂尾楼) is a real issue in China, still without a clear solution. Many families put a huge chunk of their life saving for a deposit, and it is often extremely hard to get it back.

&#x200B;

>This creates at least two problems. First, a default by a large developer can cause what is effectively a ""run on the bank"" as other buyers around the country become reluctant to put up further deposits with other property developers.

Agree. But maybe to a lesser extent than in the West. A house in China is much more than a shelter to live in. There is still a huge bias against renting. Many couples won't agree to get married without having bought a house, kids cannot go (or have much worse chance) to  good schools unless their parents bought a house in that school district, etc. So despite the risks, it is hard to imagine many people choosing not to buy at least a first (and, for many, the only) house.

The Chinese stock market is not the most transparent, and historically, people had quite a bit of mistrust in Chinese regulatory bodies. Most people simple have no place to park their money. If China significantly relaxes outflowing capital rules, I can see more Chinese buyers purchasing houses around the world, causing real estate to go up like they did in Vancouver.",

n13d9f,,investing,post,1619699725,"Basic Overview of the FDA Drug Approval ProcessWelcome to Part I of my Pharma Stocks Guide. I see a lot of interest in pharmaceuticals and my goal is to provide people with a little more information so they can make an informed decision. Today's topic will be: The FDA Drug Approval Process

The FDA Drug Approval Process can be broken down into 4 main sections: Pre-Clinical, Clinical Trials, Post Clinical, and Post Approval.

# Pre-Clinical

1. A drug's journey begins in the lab where researchers will look at thousands of compounds and eventually select a few that they believe are promising.
2. After gathering initial data on the compound the next step is further testing. This will be done either In Vitro (testing done in a petri dish/ test tube) or In Vivo (animal testing).
3. After successful testing, the pharmaceutical company will submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This includes all of the data gathered so far and a plan for testing the drugs on humans (clinical trials).
4. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND application and ensures human lives aren't at unreasonable risk. If the FDA accepts the IND, we move on to section 2 (Clinical Trials)

# Clinical trials

5) ***Phase 1*** studies consist of 20-100 **healthy volunteers** that last for **several months**. The exception being a drug used in cancer patients will be studied in patients with that type of cancer. The goal is to assess **safety** by monitoring how the drug affects the body as a whole, how long it lasts in the body, and any side effects that may appear. Results of **Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness**. I’ll repeat this because I believe it’s important: results of Phase 1 studies do not indicate effectiveness. As of 2018, the FDA states roughly **70% of drugs will pass phase 1.**

6) ***Phase 2*** studies consist of **several hundreds of people with the disease/condition.** Studies here typically take **months- 2 years**. The goal here is to observe **effectiveness** of the drug in the intended patient population. This is where we first get to see if the drug truly works. Safety and side effects are monitored further as well. Approximately **33% pass phase 2.**

7) FDA and pharmaceutical company meet to discuss plans for large scale Phase 3 studies

8) ***Phase 3*** consists of **several** **thousands of participants**. These studies typically last **1-4 years.** The goal here is to continue to observe effectiveness and safety as well as seeing how different doses of the drug or in combination with other drugs affects the outcome. It is important to note that because the **studies are larger and for a longer duration, the results are more likely to show long term or less common side effects.** Should either happen, it almost always affects the stock negatively. **Approximately** **25-30% of drugs will pass Phase 3.**

# Post Clinical

9) The pharmaceutical company files a New Drug Application (NDA). The NDA tells the FDA everything about the drug up to this point. This includes Pre-Clinical data, data from all clinical trials, as well as how the drug will be manufactured, and proposed labeling.

10) The FDA has 60 days to decide if they will accept the NDA or reject it. If accepted, the drug is now under FDA review by a review team. Each team member will review their particular portion of the NDA. For example, the medical officer reviews all clinical data, the pharmacologist reviews all Pre-Clinical data, a chemist evaluates the drug's chemical compound and stability, etc. If the NDA is rejected, the company and FDA will have to work together to resubmit a new NDA at a later date.

11) An inspection team is sent to the manufacturing site of where the drug will be made to assess for any issues that may affect the production of the drug.

12) After a thorough assessment of the reports from each review team member and the inspection team (**typically 6-10 months**), the FDA will either approve the drug or issue a Complete Response Letter (CRL) stating the drug and the application cannot be approved in its current form. This isn’t the end of the drug’s journey however, a company can work with the FDA and resubmit a NDA.

# Post Approval

13) **Phase 4** Clinical trials (often referred to as post marketing surveillance trial). These are studies conducted in a large scale (thousands of people) to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval. The company is required to send periodic updates on safety and efficacy to the FDA.

Looking at some General Numbers

* · From start (Preclinical research) to finish (FDA approval) **a drug’s journey typically takes 10 years**
* · Some studies suggest the overall chance a drug gets approved is 10%. Other studies suggest 14%.
* · If we go by the FDA numbers, lets say we have 100 potential drugs. 70% will make it to phase 2. We now have 70 hopeful drugs and only 33% make it to phase 3. We now have 23 hopeful drugs and only 25% make it to pass phase 3. So now only 5-6 drugs have made it this far (5-6%).
* · These numbers don’t exactly match because certain drugs like say for your skin are easier to get approval than cancer drugs
* · Regardless of which approval percentage you go with, studies show 2 common themes: The **FDA drug approval percentage is low** and the drug **approval chance for cancer drugs is extremely low (usually around 3%). Also, fuck cancer.**

# In Summary

* Preclinical Trials: the company does lab research on the drug via petri dishes or animal testing. No humans yet.
* IND (Investigational New Drug) application is sent to FDA. If approved we move on to clinical trials
* Phase 1: small group of healthy volunteers. Goal to observe safety. Timeline several months. 70% pass rate
* Phase 2: medium sized group of people with the intended disease/condition. Goal to observe safety AND efficacy. Timeline months - 2 years. 33% pass rate.
* Phase 3: Large scale study for long duration. Goal to further assess safety and efficacy. Timeline 1-4 years. 25-30% pass rate.
* Company then files NDA and will undergo FDA review. Hopefully approval after that.
* Phase 4: Studies safety and efficacy of the drug after FDA approval and in a large population.
* From start to finish, drug’s typically take 10 years to make
* The overall approval chance for a drug is quite low (10-14%)
* Please please be careful/contain your excitement when you see positive Phase 1 results. It really doesn’t mean much.

Their cash from operations is positive and they buy back shares, Maybe I don't fully understand what negative equity means, but as far as I know this means the business should fail and the shareholders have claim to nothing, any explanations?",

n10ce9,gwayduw,investing,comment,1619708893,"Why would anybody invest in bonds or international?

I totally get the instinct to diversify.  But I feel the push to invest in bonds is based on bond yields that simply don’t exist anymore. If bond yields were at historical

With international I get the fomo and diversification, but typically broad international markets seem to move in concert (correlate with) with SPY (at least over time), but at a lower rate or return.

n1awok,,investing,post,1619721222,"Apple stock price reaction to stellar Quarterly earnings Apple is a great long term buy according to my opinion. My Portfolio is 100% Apple. I believe this company has so many more avenues to venture into and maintain healthy growth over the following decade. I think Apple is going to beat the market return by a significant margin over the long term. My Risk tolerance is high, so no diversification.. :)

For anyone wondering why the stock is down following blowout earnings like this, there are two main reasons:

1. Covid has given tremendous tail wind to the stock by boosting its Products and services revenue: People are working from home, on their devices longer than ever boosting the need to purchase new products and buy services. However, market is slightly worried this trend may reverse when world finally deals with Covid in upcoming 6 months to a year.
2. Sustainability of current growth: Iphone was a big driver for growth this year due to 5G Upgrades. But, this may slow down as more and more people upgrade to Iphone 12 family and hence when Iphone 13 (or 12s) comes out, the demand might not be so strong. The 2022 - 2023 demand for new Ipad/Mac/Wearables may also decrease as people use their devices less given opportunities for travel and recreation open up. So, again sustainability of this stellar growth is something that worries the market and market is pricing in the fact that next year numbers might show muted growth.
3. Chip shortages: Apple along with all other companies that use semiconductor chips in their machines are facing chip shortages. Apple's this Quarter was not impacted at all because of Supply buffers, but next Quarter onwards Apple might see 4-5 BN in lost revenue due to this external factor which it has little control over. Having said that, Apple has superb negotiating skills and Tim Cook is a Supply Chain guy himself, so I am sure, Apple will be fine on this front in the long term.

TLDR: Apple is an amazing growth machine but stock is still down after stellar Quarterly results due to concerns over Post Covid demand of products and services, Lower Iphone upgrades once majority upgrade to 5G, and Chip Shortages. The stock is pricing in these concerns, but over the long term, Apple has been and will reward its investors.",['AAPL']

I don't disagree with this notion. I also recently added new exposure to LatAm (most notably Brazil).

What is ""ours""? USA?

>I'm not going to post specific, in depth TA or research into any particular stocks

But this is the best and most important part? If you don't want to get into your DD then how about amusing me a bit with these questions:

* How do feel about the risk of weak returns since Brazil has been in a decade of economic down turn? Historically Brazil has had booms that market them look like they'll reach developed status only to bust back into developing status.

* Have you factored in the problems with inflation and continued currency weakness? US might be printing like crazy, but LatAm currencies are experiencing inflation not only against their own goods/services but also against the dollar.

* Are you factoring the various troubles of Bolsonaro government having immediate and long term impacts?

* How are you so sure those individual stocks will do so well? Investing in Brazil is already risky as is with it likely being outside the circle of competence of most people. The added individual stock picks only increases those risks. Why not invest in an ETF like EWZ?

* What makes you think that these Brazilian stocks or even a Brazilian ETF can outperform US stocks when historically speaking the US & S&P has beaten Brazil and the Brazilian top stocks in basically every time range be it 1yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, or 50yr?

“The commodity cost challenges we face this year will, obviously, be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care, and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that would go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid-to-high single digits.”

Honeywell

“And for us, inflation is taking hold. There is no doubt about it. We knew it. We see it, it's real. And if you don't stay on top of it, the two areas where -- and this is not a surprise. Steel, semiconductors, copper, ethylene, those are the four elements that we saw substantial inflation in Q1…. I don't think things are going to abate. The short cycle is definitely hard. We all read the same articles around semiconductors and what's going on there. And I think we're going to have to just stay ahead of it. But we do expect that inflationary environment this year and we're going to be to stay ahead of it.”

Kimberly Clark

“I'd like to start the call today with a few brief remarks. Our first quarter results and outlook have been impacted by supply chain disruption, faster-than-expected consumer tissue de-stocking, and a sharp rise in input costs. While I'm not pleased with the results and our outlook, we're taking decisive actions to manage through the short-term challenges we face.”

Coca-Cola

“… we're closely monitoring upward pressure in some inputs, such as high fructose corn syrup, PET, metals and other packaging materials as they impact us, as well as our bottling partners.”

PepsiCo

“In terms of '21, there is certainly higher input inflation, but it's been factored into the '21 guidance, notably in terms of agricultural and packaging. In addition to that, we have also factored in the higher freight and transportation costs that we're experiencing out there right now.”

Nestle

“I would like to caution against excessive margin growth expectations based on these strong sales growth. We now see broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Not all of these items can be hedged and our hedging cover for a number of commodities will run out over time. We are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there is a time lag associated with pricing.”

Danone

“When it comes to inflation, you're absolutely right to say that we have seen an accelerating inflation since the start of the year, which is impacting us, I would say, across the different ingredients, which is on milk, but also other dairy ingredients, on plastics, on sugar, but also, as I said, on logistics and transport. And we are reaching now a very strong mid-single digit level when it comes to inflation.”

Boston Beer

“On the freight, clearly, this is -- there's a factor that you probably have heard that on other calls in the industry. There's a real shortage of drivers and of trucks. So the ratio between available trucks and loads have significantly worsened. And that's what we see in the rate. To the point that we've broken it out really in the earnings release separately because the impact is significant. And it really depends, right. We have contracted rates, but then you don't get the truck and you have to go deeper into it. So we've seen the impact on multiple levels. One is the input costs are going up …it's coming into are our cost and materials and that's ingredients, the packaging materials. So we see it there.”

Celanese

“I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think, the good news is, we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already and started moving prices in engineered materials to reflect this, and of course, that price ultimately still gets reflected more quickly. So although it is an inflationary pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing and basically maintain the same level of variable margin.”

Crown Holdings

“…we thought it would be well to remind you that delivered aluminum in North America sits around $1.28 a pound versus $0.75 a pound last year at this time. So an increase of 70% and as we contractually pass through the LME and the delivery premium reported revenues will reflect both volume increases and the higher aluminum cost this year.”

Steel Dynamics

“Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs.”

Mattel

“We're not going to talk about specific pricing actions or timing. But we are evaluating price adjustments for the recent increases in input costs and I would also want to point out that despite the cost inflation we're it seeing and the impact it's having on gross margin.”

Whirlpool

“So while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs.”

Snap-On

“Look -- yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you? Right. And so part of the thing is you got -- you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yes, we might see some, but we're not -- at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April, early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up.”

GATX Corporation

“…we buy cars both on the spot market and through our supply agreements that the majority of which is through the supply agreements. So certainly, the increased price of steel is increasing the cost of a car across the board.”

Dover Corporation

“I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation, but there is inflation and it's not just a raw materials because raw materials are in the subcomponents that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly at the assembly level on labor availability is becoming a problem and that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from, it's a capital good size that are buying a lot of raw materials now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year. On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs we ship a lot of product that's FOB, so we're not, it's more inbound logistics costs then it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because you're going to add. I mean, God forbid, you have to air freight anything right now. It's a bit of a negative.

Sonoco

“Our Industrial segment was hit the hardest with price/cost challenges, due to the higher OCC costs internationally as well as higher-than-expected inflation and operating costs like energy and freight.”

TE Connectivity

“Certainly, we're feeling the biggest inflation right now is on the freight side. The freight inflation has been significant and as we battle through there and there's a variety of reasons for that, including higher air freights and so forth in terms of that and that's not unique to TE. Certainly, I think that's been -- is well publicized across the overall supply chain. We are -- as we move towards the second half of the year, we are seeing a little bit higher input costs, particularly with the resins and some of that pretty directly attributable to the weather issues that were in Texas here earlier this past quarter. And then, the copper prices as we've continued to monitor those, we've seen those creep up. In some cases, we have hedges in place in terms of how we hedge our metals cost.”

Badger Meter

“I mean even Just in the first quarter, we saw the input cost go from $3.60 to today $4.20 and that's after March having been a relatively favorable change that obviously has been erased here in the month of April. So I think it's what we've been saying all along in terms of the continued price focus and the opportunity and the market acceptance of being able to pass some of those increases through in today's dynamics and in today's environment. We're going to continue to do that, and we're going to do that to a degree that we're able to -- we believe we'll be able to offset the majority of the cost pressures. And I don't see that changing dramatically as we move forward.”","['KO', 'DE', 'PEP', 'DOV', 'SNA', 'CE', 'WHR', 'TEL']"

Super markets, telcos? Like Kroger, Verizon or China Mobile there are still some value-pearls in the market. The goods they sell are in demand whatever may come. Maybe a good idea?
Medicine? Stable companies like Roche or BMY. Maybe this could be a smart way to stabilize the portfolio?

Or the risky obvious choice? Big tech like Alphabet. Their growth outpaces inflation. Their strong balance sheets give buying opportunities if the market should crash. The risk? Dependend on high growth. Interest up - > WACC up - > Valuation down. Growth down - > Valuation down.

2019 : ""Inverted yield curve everything is going to go tits up""

2020 : ""This isn't a recession it's a depression""

2021 : ""Inflation is going to tits up""

Looking at how everything turned out, Reddit's prediction accuracy is pretty low if you ask me. **Every person working in the financial and I mean everyone, was expecting inflation to rise starting in March-April since last summer.** No one is surprised at all.

**Here is an advice, if you really want to grasp how persistent is inflation, you want to look at how high are the base effects,  companies can pass through the cost of higher inputs, what's the state of demand what is exactly pushing it and is it structural ? Can supply adapt quickly enough and do they have the capacity to adapt in the first place ?**

To answer all of this questions reading articles or opinions you pulled of Google News won't cut it. You need to look at actual data, numbers in a spreadsheet or Refinitiv/Bloomberg terminal something that gives you a macro view of the economy.

If you really believe that inflation is coming : idk short Treasuries and use the proceeds to buy TIPS. No one sane would do that, but if you're 100% sure that inflation is inevitable this is a safe move from your point of view.",['GOOGL']

The best advice I can give to young, new investors is to IGNORE the trends, and do NOT invest in individual stocks at first. 

This advice may not be exciting or sexy, and it may seem pretty vanilla, but one of the best decisions you can make as a young investor is to simply invest your money in a low-cost ETF that tracks an index like the S&P 500 or Russell 2000. 

The benefit of this strategy is that you’ll immediately receive diversification across multiple sectors of the economy (which is extremely important when building a portfolio), you’ll be invested in quality companies that have inherent value and aren’t just propped up by market trends, and you won’t incur the kinds of costs or capital gains taxes that come with actively managed funds. 

You may not see massive gains in the short term, and you’ll definitely see volatility, but if you want to build up as much wealth over the long-term as possible and want to have the peace of mind of knowing without a doubt that your investments will eventually recover, this is one of the best ways to get started, especially if you’re only able to invest $25 or $50 a week/month.",['SPGI']

-at the same time this fear has moved that money to ‘value’ stocks. Mainly the traditional financial sector, energy, and utilities. And here we go again! Up goes companies stock that in many cases are also not supported by financial success. 

-the fed is printing money and handing it out. This feeds the economy in theory and worked back 2008 but we’ll see what affect it has now. 

-Biden admin is doing some policy stuff that freaks people out. Tax those cap gains on millionaires, waiving pharmaceutical patents, plans to raise min wage, etc. Every time they have a press conference something freaks people out and a little dip of 1-3% seems to happen. Short lived though. 

-big tech and profitable ‘growth’ companies are flat. They are not in a bubble. With slight high valuations compared to past, they still are projected to double or more in 5 years when equalized to avg valuations.

n6zd28,,StockMarket,post,1620396549,"Learnings from 10 yrs. Wall St. experience - what to do now / steps to estimate stock valueHey everybody! I've 10 yrs of wall st experience (research analyst / market structure). I feel a lot of your pain with the sell-off in growth names. It's definitely craziest market environments I've seen.

Here's some practical concepts and tactics to help (I will also be reviewing my portfolio over the next few days with the same plan).

**TLDR: Investing = change, Basics of business model, Estimate valuation.**

My plan is to share what I've learned into a step-by-step book. If interested, I'd love your [feedback here](https://forms.gle/RyycWAxNRsGZSxwTA) (2 minutes!). Here is the [outline of the book.](https://henrychien.com/investing-book/) (Or leave a comment!) Get in on the [pre-sale!](https://gum.co/czkJr)\*

**Investing = change.** A basic reminder that we buy shares of businesses that will be worth more in the future. There is some change happening and the business will have higher future finances. The fun (and painful) part is using a thesis (expectations) and matching it with your risk tolerance and goals.

I am fairly confident ecommerce will grow in SE Asia and the $SE founder will execute. And also I am willing still willing to bet that banks will want to use A.I. type credit decisioning with $UPST.

Focus on the change - the y/y % growth in the future - and the future valuation of the business.

*$RKT is perfect example of this. The guidance for 2Q21 loan volumes is 14%, which is a huge slowing from the 100+% y/y rate in 1Q21. Earning estimates are coming down for '22/23, especially since everyone knows their business declined in '17-18 and '13-14 with rate hikes. So the stock continues to be sold off.*

*And it works in the opposite way too! if rates decline and loan volumes increase 21/'22 (more than expected), estimates will likely go up and the stock will too!*

**Understand business model.** Also the basics -simplify the company to a way that you can estimate its future value. What is the value of its product and service to customers, what type of market is it in? What is management's vision - particularly its strategy to grow and the source of profits?

You can get these from MD&A sections in 10Ks, investor presentations, and videos with management.

For example, I've learned that $PLBY new management plans expand licensing into several consumer product areas, where the value to customers is the brand assets. And also the $DMTK product value is a non-invasive test which is supposed to more economical and the growth will come from insurance coverage. This leads to...

**Estimate future valuation.** Businesses are valued on future growth (size in the future) and the future cash flows they will generate. The basic high-level steps to get there:

*Unit economics /revenue* \- estimate the volume and price of products / services over the next few years. For example, tests / transactions and $ per unit, to get revenues.

*Estimate the margin* \- what are the expenses to get there, and more importantly, what can be ""leveraged"" i.e. have more sales per $ of costs. For example, higher prices per unit usually creates higher gross margins. This gets you earnings (which over-time, equals cash flows).

*Estimate balance sheet use* \- capital will be needed to expand the business. This is ""capex"" or ""R&D"" or similar for innovative companies. Negative earnings also means cash will be used.

*Estimate capital raises.* This means debt (increases financial ""leverage"" or change in earnings with revenues, both ways, and also bankruptcy risk), or from equity (which dilutes your share).

*Estimate value* \- A tool for this is ""multiples"" off forward metrics. For example, enterprise value (EV) / next twelve months (NTM) sales. EV / NTM EBITDA and P/E are popular for earnings.

Find peers (similar business model, space and financial profile). You can use proxy peers or similar analyst coverage. Take their multiples and apply it to your estimated future sales or earnings.

**Now you have an estimate of where the stock can go.** Make sure to discount it back (say 10%) each year which is your required level of return for holding stocks. Have this to manage your idea.

Happy investing everyone!!!

I am currently looking to manage a fund with my friends & family about 7 people total. I am interested in buying 2/3 different stocks with the money each investor contributes, myself included, and then I would execute the trades in the group account with the money that was contributed. I currently keep track of all investments by hand on the computer but as we grow, I wanted a more streamlined approach.

Is there an app or website that can track investor percentage based on how much money party “A” has put into the fund? I have 6 members currently and I’ve been doing the math by hand and keeping track of the stock price when I make the purchase for each member. But I wanted to know if there was a more streamlined approach to managing the current equity of the group, investor ownership percentage, current market worth of each investor within the group based on percentage of group ownership dependent on when their portion bought-in to a certain security and how much they contributed.

TL;DR is there a build-your-own mutual fund app or website that I could use?

This breakout has failed to sustain and immediately tested support at $5.20 where it has attracted buyers and once again immediately tested $5.40 area.

Currently the price of ZKIN is still giving the resistance at $5.40 some hard time. It's not important now to break above this value, rather stay above it and confirm $5.40 as a support.

Confirming $5.40 as a support would change the overall short term downtrend into a long awaited uptrend.

The overall trend remains still a downtrend, hovering above $5.40 can easily change this trend.

Still this is just an oversold bounce, but considering it's coming from a bullish pattern which sometimes changes the trend, it's likely to get changed.

Current resistance is now at $5.40 and support at $5.20.

RSI is in a clear trend of higher highs and lows. A break above 60 is necessary in order to see another move to the upside, that could reach the price of $5.60 with spikes higher.

MACD is in a long buying wave. A corrective wave is expected soon as this buying wave is pretty overextended.

n6gxmv,,StockMarket,post,1620333220,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 6, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it’s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week—a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group’s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

n6ewtr,gx84z9v,StockMarket,comment,1620352585,"You're buying too many high-risk/high-reward things.

These ARK funds are often companies that aren't turning a profit yet or have just started to, and many believe in the near future. They aren't making enough money to justify the price it is now, but they might be in 3-4 years.

What happens is the moment something small increases the risk they don't, they go down faster than everything else.

A company that is and has been turning a profit and the company's stock price is no more than $15-$35 their earnings will stay relatively stable, but generally grows more gradually. These are safer investments.

&#x200B;

VTI is good. It is a market ETF, but the problem is it is way too small in your portfolio. You have to get that balance between riskier stocks and non-risky stocks. ARK ETFs+risky tech stocks are typically no more than 5-10% of my portfolio when bought alone. My index funds are already buying small amounts of those companies, so I'm really 10-15% into riskier high-growth assetts.

Then I want safer growth assets that take some risk. AMD is a good example of this actually, Taiwan Semiconductor probably is too. They are tech based, but they have profits now to warrant their pricing with room to grow. The current P/E ratio is $33.06. That means for every $1 annually AMD earns in profits now, it costs $33.06 to own that share. This is an example of something that is slightly above average risky, but isn't that bad.

My portfolio, collectively, has 20-30% in this level of risk. Beyond that I'm in market index funds and I am also buying value stock. These are companies that have long sense made it. There isn't much room for growth, but they have a stable product that is making consistent money. They keep operating their stock goes up at a slower rate and they give stockholders dividends between 1%-7%, depending on the situation and other metrics. These types of stocks usually have a P/E ratio in the lower range $12-$20.

n6s5av,,StockMarket,post,1620369161,"Thoughts: Prepare for rotation out of pandemic stocks?Just a random thought. A lot of companies that were seen as a safe haven during the pandemic (online companies, technology, healthcare...whatever people thought would be more COVID proof, as well as COVID recovery plays, cryptos, resources) are most likely overbought right now.

It’s probably still a ways out, but I would imagine that if those are your whole portfolio it would be a good time to start rethinking that.

There are two possible scenarios here, either COVID and pandemics in general just become a fact of life or we get to a point of mass vaccination.

Either way, when that shift happens and the economy goes back to normal it will probably be a bad idea to keep holding all of those.

I’d imagine there would be a rotation out of them because they have no room left to keep running and because there will be bigger growth opportunities in companies hit hard by COVID when they start beating the low earnings expectations that were set during the pandemic.

Using the science of guesstimation I’d think some of those sectors are due for a 40% to 50% drop once the whole pandemic settles and investors start to go back to old patterns which will probably trigger some panic selling and cause a smaller market crash that only affects certain industries.

It’s just something on my mind I felt like sharing. It’s probably a ways off but I’m thinking it would be something to be aware of.

[***Chris Lange***](https://247wallst.com/author/chris-lange/)***May 4, 2021 11:53 pm***

One ARK exchange-traded fund run by ETF star Cathie Wood bought over 1.5 million shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. ([**NYSE: PLTR**](https://247wallst.com/companies/pltr/)) shares on Tuesday, as the prices of this ETF traded down over 3% in Tuesday’s session. The ETF is up well over 100% in the last year.

ARK Innovation ETF ([**NYSEARCA: ARKK**](https://247wallst.com/companies/arkk/)) bought 1,514,080 shares of Palantir. At Tuesday’s closing price this would have valued this purchase at roughly $32.8 million. This is only a small fraction of the total holdings. ARKK is up 112% over the past 52 weeks.

24/7 Wall St. [**recently reported on Palantir**](https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2021/02/18/goldman-sachs-raises-price-targets-on-sizzling-momentum-tech-stocks/):

>This company came public as a direct listing and struggled out of the gate, but the stock seems to be taking off now. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) builds and deploys software platforms for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations.  
The company offers Palantir Gotham, a software platform for government operatives in the defense and intelligence sectors, which enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals to intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, as well as facilitates the handoff between analysts and operational users, helping operators plan and execute real-world responses to threats that have been identified within the platform.  
The company also provides Palantir Foundry, a platform that transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data, and it allows individual users to integrate and analyze the data they need in one place.

n6wmqa,,StockMarket,post,1620388097,"What can a company do to avoid sinking along with the country?Okay so this might seem like an out of the blue question.

Today, the United States hosts by far the best and most well established companies worldwide.

I'm optimistic about the future of these companies. However, I can't say the same regarding the United States as a whole.

Let's say that, hypothetically, the US were to gradually sink, decline, collapse (whatever you want to call it).

What can these big companies do to avoid sinking along with the country that hosts them? Do they have tools? better chances for survival? or is it game over for them?

I really like the companies that I invest in (after days or even weeks of research, of course.)

But there's this little issue that bugs me every time I invest in US stocks, and it's that I feel like the US has already reached it's peak, and I don't know what the future holds for this country given all these obstacles that they brought upon themselves.. (currency inflation, rising global competition by Asia, gigantic national debt, defecits, political polarization.. just to name a few).

I know there's probably no better alternative, but this issue is preventing me from investing a larger sum of money.

Feel free to discuss whatever topic that's related to the question. Cheers!",

n6wmqa,gx9obnc,StockMarket,comment,1620392383,"I’d frankly be more concerned about the giant economic bubble China has created than the US reaching “gigantic national debt.” China’s currency situation is far more dire than America’s. They’ve devalued the Yuan to prop up an economy built on fake and structurally unsound growth.

The USSR also had fast industrialization with currency manipulation. They also had a secretive communist dictatorship that falsely propped up an economy. Nothing in history is an exact repeat, but I wouldn’t count on China to supplant the United States based on falsified data and unrealistic growth.

Also, America has had periods of political unrest before: civil rights era, the Great Depression, the blundering generation.

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *This Post:* [Dogecoin To The Moon Logo](https://old.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n6z9m0/dogecoin_to_the_moon_logo/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

n68sm8,,StockMarket,post,1620312045,"Trading in an overvalued market?Hey everyone, to put it simply I've been trying to get another entry in my preferred ETF that replicates the SP 500.

I usually purchase consistently every month but I made the mistake of skipping a few months as I thought it were overvalued. Now markets are still at all time highs and I don't feel comfortable investing my 'serious cash' into such an overvalued market.

The issue I'm seeing is when the market has a very, VERY slight correction, people flock to buy up as entry has been unbelievably limited in my experience - hence pushing prices further.

So my general question is:
How long do you think this booming market will last?

My cash is stacking up and I really don't feel comfortable purchasing at these prices, as a result I've been allocating more cash into my 'play money' system, but I just don't like doing that as much.

Until the major correction comes in, what do you recommend I do? More or less looking for ideas.

n6ljy0,,StockMarket,post,1620345903,"Why $OPEN (Opendoor) will dominate the real estate market!&#x200B;

* 8.9% of consumers are planning to move in the next 6 months. This is a 20 year high!
* Lumber prices are at all-time highs continuing to push up home prices
* Lumber production was at a 13 year high in February, pointing to the strong demand 
* Buffer agrees, saying - “We’ve got nine home builders in addition to our manufactured housing and operation, which is the largest in the country. So we really do a lot of housing. The costs are just up, up, up.”
* March saw 1.7m housing starts which seem high but is actually average for historical standards if you zoom out. 
* On a population-adjusted basis, we built only HALF the homes we historically would have built during the 2010s. 
* $OPEN has proven its ability to pivot with changes in the market as they were able to post strong numbers through 2020. 
* $OPEN has more homes for sale than rivals Zillow and Offerpad combined! 
* $OPEN’s increased scale gives them more data and a better ability to fine-tune their machine learning algorithms 
* $OPEN plans to double available markets to 42 this year
* $OPEN is selling at <1x sales whereas $Z sells at \~8x! 
* $OPEN is projected to have similar growth and better ibuying margins

All of this paints a fairly bullish outlook for Opendoor long-term. This is one of the few SPACs Cathie Wood has maintained strong ownership in, and I expect it to pay future dividends for those who follow her lead. Thoughts anyone?

I found PRTY Holdings (Party City among the bussiness that seemed to have great Holdings and seemed to have performed a complete reversal breaking out of a falling wedge pattern. To me this was a bullish pattern and when I thought about it more I actual have been seeing more stores open and people would have more celebrations after a year of no contact.

Purchase
I soon after purchased 5000 after it had a retest to the major trend line. I expected significant gains on the speculation of the end of lockdowns and am up 20%.

n5qbwu,,StockMarket,post,1620248080,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 5, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**

Stocks reversed from yesterday’s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, “I do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it’s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it’s consumer confidence, whether it’s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a “mistake”. He said, “Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about it’s plans to expand to the European markets.
* Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year. Virgin Galactic plans to reopen ticket sales after the founder makes his own first flight, now slated for the summer after several delays.
* The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
* Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates.

n5xq6v,,StockMarket,post,1620270278,"Does anyone notice a different outcome when trading options on different trading platforms? Also, which platform is your favorite for options trading?From my perspective, there are some HUGE investment brokerage houses (like Fidelity) that charges a nominal amount to execute a trade, and there are others that don't charge a fee to execute a trade (such as RobinHood). I'm thinking that the big brokerage houses that charge a fee have a different operation model, and it **seems to me**, but I haven't scientifically proved this, that they may get better pricing or better execution or both. 

So my two questions are: 

* Does anyone notice a different outcome when trading options on different trading platforms? 
* Which platform is your favorite for options trading?",

n70cim,,wallstreetbets,post,1620399220,"My first DD: I'm a doctor and I think $INO is about to moonshotFirst of all this is all just my speculation and not financial advice. I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to stocks and I've only been doing this for like a couple months. I am not a financial advisor or professional. What I am is a physician with at least some literacy, though not expertise, in oncology. In fact I am hoping to become an oncologist once I'm done with all my training. Without further ado...I present my first DD:

I was working the overnight shift at my hospital last night and was doing some late night reddit browsing when I saw someone post about INO filing a new patent and potential for a buyout from Regeneron ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron\_rgen\_is\_rumored\_to\_be\_buying\_out\_ino/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron_rgen_is_rumored_to_be_buying_out_ino/)). The guy who posted it is a 5 year user and his name had ""MD"" in it so it caught my attention...but he has almost no post history other than asking 4 years ago about making a career out of consulting for EPIC (epic is the #1 electronic medical chart for those of you unfamiliar) and anyone asking that probably 1) is actually a doctor and 2) doesn't want to work in medicine because it's toxic af and I can totally relate...the sort of person who would have interest in using their knowledge and training for picking stocks instead of being a clinician...not much unlike the famous Dr. Burry

That said his post just looked weird and sus af so I decided to ""do my own DD"" as they say. Now I am not 100% sure OP above is a real doctor but I do know that  I'm a doctor so I should be able to interpret this ish pretty well (ok just a little well), right?

Background

I open the patent application and read up on it. My first impression? Lol you can't treat GBM. For those of you unaware GBM is a horrible horrible brain cancer (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma)) that is one of the few ""death sentences"" that exist in medicine. I had the unfortunate experience of having not just one but two of my friends in medical school have a parent die from GBM and it was absolutely devastating to watch. Because of the nature of brain cancer there's basically nothing that can be done to treat this. Currently patients undergo radiation which is horribly morbid and doesn't help much. Patients die within a year basically 100% of the time even with advances such as ""gamma knife"" radiation. I have personally witnessed the treatment of GBM as a medical student and the prevailing sentiment is that it's basically untreatable. But then I read more about their tech and the patent and....wait a second this actually sounds legit. So now to break down some of the science behind this....

Methods

INO's patented tech is that they use a unique delivery system to basically deliver their drugs through impermeable membranes. To put it in non-doctor terms they trojan horse medicine into the walled off city of your brain. Your brain is particularly difficult to treat with chemotherapy and immunotherapy (two of the main methods of medical cancer treatment) due to what is called the blood brain barrier. Your brain is (reasonably so) walled off from the rest of your body to avoid bad shit getting up in there. Unfortunately that means we can't get medicine up in there either. In particular the medicine they have developed (INO 5401) is a PD-1 inhibitor, but delivered into the brain. As soon as I saw PD-1 this peaked my interest hard. anti PD-1 drugs are immunotherapy medications that ""uncloak"" cancer from hiding from your immune system. The same mechanism of action is used in the very successful drug Keytruda aka Pembrolizumab (read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab)) which has been used in other very deadly cancers like Sarcoma and Melanoma. The idea of being able to use this same class of drug on a brain cancer is crazy smart and the problem until now has been delivery of that drug. That's where INO comes in with their patented tech.

Results

Go to the patent link above and click ""images"". This is the money shot. MRI on left = v bad cancer. MRI on the right = cancer is dead. What. Yep. Their patent describes necrosis of the tissue with complete resolution. Mind blowing. Now I'm sure this doesn't work that well in EVERY patient because response to PD-1 inhibitors is varied. Most of the time it's a long shot but when it works IT FUCKING WORKS. I have literally seen melanoma and sarcoma MELT away...but only in some patients. I have seen patients with Stage IV terminal cancer be literally cured. Every GBM patient in the world should have access to this treatment. Oh and did I mention the lead inventor on the patent is a pediatric neuro-oncologist that worked at a very prestigious hospital in NY previously? Google her.

Conclusion

Ok so I'm now convinced of the science side but how does this all equal money? I go look up the study. This is a phase 2 trial meaning that they are looking to see if the drug is effective (phase 1 = is the drug safe, phase 2 = does the drug work...did I mention that before I was a doctor I ran clinical research studies?). I saunter over to clinical[trials.gov](https://trials.gov) (the federal website where all clinical trials are listed) and notice that the trial for this drug is set to be complete June 2021. The completion date is when the final patient has completed study protocol...meaning they have 99% of their data and the study is essentially complete. I then saunter over to [google.com](https://google.com) (the worlds largest search engine) and look for other data they have. Turns out they have ALREADY PUBLISHED EXTREMELY PROMISING INTERIM DATA ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-demonstrates-80-6-month-progression-free-survival-in-phase-2-glioblastoma-multiforme-gbm-study-with-ino-5401-in-combination-with-pd-1-inhibitor-libtayo-cemiplimab-300951433.html)). ""Overall survival"" and ""Progression free survival"" are the holy grails of results in cancer research. The fact that they have 80% progression free survival less than halfway through this study is mind blowing. I can only imagine what sort of data they have now considering they included an image of complete resolution of a GBM tumor on their patent. But again ... how is it that this is gonna moon soon? Well because $INO just signed up to present their findings at not one but two upcoming conferences. [https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc\_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/479936946/files/doc_news/INOVIO-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-May-2021.pdf). Dates: May 12, May 18. Not just a one tiered moon shot, but a two tiered moon shot! 

Discussion

In conclusion: their study showing the delivery of a highly effective drug, to a cancer that is otherwise a death sentence and currently has NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS is coming to an end and results are imminent. Two upcoming conferences to disclose their findings. I don't know what I'm more excited about...a potential game changing treatment for a devastating disease that has personally touched people I love or this rocket ride to the moon. I like the stock. I like the tech. I like the implications to cancer treatment.

INFLATION IS HERE

So far the $10s of trillions of printed money has not translated into inflation in official consumer prices.

But we are now seeing major inflation in commodity prices.

If we just look at food commodity prices, they are up 54% since July 2020.

And if we look at general commodity prices – up 89% since April 2020 – they are telling us that high inflation  is not far away.


Dow gold ratio 

Even though gold has yielded an excellent return, it is what happens to the Dow/Gold ratio in the future that determines if investors should stay with stocks or hold gold.

Gold bottomed at $250 in 1999 as the ratio peaked at 45. The ratio subsequently fell to 5 in 2011 and corrected from there to 22.5 in 2018.

Since 2018, the Dow/Gold downtrend has resumed. The indicator at the bottom of the chart is the quarterly MACD which is a very important indication of the long term trend. The MACD turned down in 2019 for the first time since the 1999 top. This is a very strong sign that Dow/Gold has now resumed the long term downtrend.

If we then look at the long term picture of the Dow/Gold ratio, it gives us a very good idea of where we are heading.

2021 expectation 

We have tried to break 1800 in Gold and 27.2 in silver on at least 4 occasions and we’re trying again as I post . It’s safe to say that when this level breaks, one should expect a sharp rise higher.

The latest attempt 2 days ago was undermined by a nonsensical comment from Yellen:

""May need rate hikes to stop the economy from overheating.""

This had the effect of causing Gold to dump from 1800 and today again over 1800

Damage done, Yellen quickly recanted her statement:

“Let me be clear it’s not something Nobody’s predicting or recommending.”

Then why say it?

Gold put a double bottom in place at 1770 and silver 26.5 and then head back up to resistance again:

Unless we get some new algo triggering news, it looks like a break of 1800 in gold and 30 in silver is imminent. We keep testing that 1800 level and more frequently now, which signals it impending demise as a resistance level.

For silver my opinion is clear and Uber bullish and 
I would not be surprised  to see the 1980 and 2011 $50 high up to $80  to be taken out in 2021. 

I wish I had more to say this post , but who wants to hear a running commentary on how paint dries. We have our levels to watch, I’m sure that when they break we’re going to get some rapid moves to the upside, imho.",['DOW']

Paid a billion in lawsuits last year for manipulating the market and has been accused of doing far worse for decades.

Demand for actual silver is at historic levels - used in most electronics, cars, solar panels etc. Add to that monetary value as a hedge against rising inflation. It has to go up. It reached $50 over a decade ago when demand was far lower, and the dollar itself was worth far less. You're telling me it's worth less than half at $25? There's nowhere else to go but up. JP Morgan and gang just need to get out of the way first - and for that to happen physical demand has to cause defaults on contracts. When people asking for delivery suddenly don't get it - price is going to go through the roof. A lot of smart people are saying demand is far higher than the number crunchers are showing because they're not properly accounting for hedge purchases as ""demand"" because they're not asking for delivery.

Just don't buy SLV. PSLV or something with physical allocation, not just paper promises that won't put any immediate demand on the real system.

n6qu0p,,wallstreetbets,post,1620363810,"Are we headed for a massive failure in the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security market, which would have massive repercussions on the economy as a whole?https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-says-stock-market-boom-ebullient-investors-warrant-caution-2021-05-06/

decent article by Reuters today on the possible bubble worries but its much deeper. there is a host of issues.. the income of the commercial real estate holders has been inflated due to covid and the need to keep the mortgages afloat. 

So as the income has gotten inflated and these properties were bought up during covid, real estate prices rose like crazy, Im sure you noticed. So all the mortgages come in with inflated incomes but there is a selection of mortgages which yield higher premiums as they carry more risk. As maybe you know these are bundled, rated, and sold. Called Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities and there are plenty of CMBS ETFs worth total of hundreds of billions, if not over a trillion, on the market. With very large institutional holdings, obviously, which have large holdings.

The FED released their [Financial Stability Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20210506.pdf) today. Basically saying valuations are high. Equities more than doubled the avg annual growth (22.5 to 9%) last year, treasury securities have tripled avg annual growth (26 to  8.3%), high yield and unrated bonds have almost quadrupled it (25 to 7.1). Not to mention the risk premiums on high yield unrated bonds are to 2008 levels. 

Here is a key paragraph from the report on the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities market: ""Other indicators continue to show strains in CRE markets. Vacancy rates continue to increase, and rent growth has declined fur-ther. Additionally, delinquency rates on com-mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which usually contain riskier loans, remain elevated. Finally, the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that banks, on net, reported weaker demand for most CRE loans and tighter lending standards in the fourth quarter of  2020 (figure 1-14)""

So basically, Commerial Real Estate is on an obvious bubble, about to come back down, and when it does, it is going to create a whole lot of turmoil. It will be reminiscent of 2008 as the bonds fail and tumble the house of cards.. again. Fuck.

Now Im sure if I know this, much smarter people do and have started hedging a market failure. So I have been paying attention to larger market options plays and noticed 60 million in puts bought on the S&P 500 today 7/16 strike 4000, 7/30 strike 3900, 9/17 strike 3100 and 3000 (30+million spent on just 9/17). All in large bulk orders. 

I am of the thesis we are about to see a massive correction on this mess.

I have no bear position and am sharing it as soon as I can because I think it is important.",['SPGI']

""John M Griffen and Alex Priest are, respectively, a prominent professor of finance and a Ph.D. candidate at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. In a [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) released last November, they sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019.

“Overall,” they write, “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.” This was just the average, however: Some originators — including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse, “having more than 35% of their loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatement.”

UT Study referenced: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3671162](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162)

TLDR: The Dollar General that you go to while your wife is with her boyfriend is getting a loan on overstated operating income, when it goes under it's put back in another CMBS security with a slightly different address.  


""Flynn also alleges in the complaint that changes in names and addresses when loans are moved out of old trusts and into new ones are not an accident but suggestive of deliberate obfuscation. “The correlation of name and address changes with inflated numbers,” he says, “is something like 95 percent.”""

But this is not financial advice nor am I am financial advisor this is simply my personal opinion.

But, what I will say is that I analyze data for a living, I monitor patterns and trends, and heck I even taught math. Empirical knowledge is the best knowledge because it is backed by evidence and observation whether that is done personally or gathered through research, and that my friends is how I like to make my decisions as you should too.

In this TA (I am even hesitant to do a TA on $GME due to volatility) but I promise to be as objective as possible. I enjoy finding trades, and I love to find solid entry points, but what I have found out over the years is that it is nearly impossible to perfectly time the bottom or the top which is why certain indicators are essential is recognizing a solid set up.

To make this super easy to understand I have narrowed down this T.A. to 4, yes only 4 indicators for you. RSI (relative strength index), Bollinger Bands, EMA (exponential moving average), and OBV (on balance volume).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alvmfjxvqpx61.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=48483d32c481c5090b1f35fd3c17a324d49b1646

RSI: Quick note - RSI under 30 is over sold, RSI over 70 is over bought which is why you will see strong upward advances (traders like to load up at low levels such as 30 and below and stock goes up) or corrections (traders like to sell off at these levels 70 and above and stock goes down). Bullish zone is between 40 to 85+ (stock will gradually increase).

$GME: The diagram above illustrates the Day chart. The RSI has never dropped below 40 since JULY 2020! The 40 range has developed a solid support which is why I think the stock will continue to rise. Regardless of every dip the stock experienced it has bounced off of the support and gradually increased which represents a bullish signal.

Bollinger Bands: Quick note - When Bollinger bands squeeze (the white lines) around the stock price means a lower volatility rate meaning high volatility is on its way. The direction of the volatility is dependent on other indicators which you will see how they all correlate.

$GME: Not trying to get ahead of myself, but with an increasing RSI, increasing OBV, and the stock remaining above the 55 EMA all indicators point up.

55 EMA: Quick note - everything as we know always deviates towards the mean (average). This is more than just stocks, look it up its wild. Why do you think the mean is one of the most used (and useful) forms of measurements? This can be applied to everything involving numbers. Anyway, anytime a stock remains above the 55 EMA (I use 55 because its a part of Fibonacci, that's a whole rabbit hole of it's own), it represents another bullish signal.

$GME: The yellow line represents the 55 EMA and anytime the stock came close or dropped slightly under we saw it bounce off and continue up. As of now it is currently trading along the 55 EMA with the Bollinger bands squeezing and if history continues to repeat itself we should see an increase in price.

OBV: Quick note - OBV is an indicator of momentum, and measures buying and selling pressure. In simple terms an increasing OBV shows that the volume on days when the stock price is increasing is greater than the volume on days when the stock price is decreasing. More buyers than sellers.

$GME: Increasing OBV, more buy volume than sell volume which will result in higher prices.

TLDR; I like numbers, I am good with numbers, and throughout this T.A. the goal was to remove all biases and stick to the technicals and fundamentals of what the stock was showing me. I notice a bullish RSI above 40 since July 2020, I notice Bollinger bands squeezing on the day chart, I notice a strong support at the 55 EMA, and I notice a constant increase in the OBV. I like to find solid trades that have potential and I see a lot of potential here. Not financial advice.",

That scripted act put on for the public was an embarrassment. For the most part, they were served up softball questions easily hit out of the park. If you listened closely to what Gary Gensler said and the way he reacted when thrown the couple of hardballs to him, you’d have to know that he’s definitely not on the side of the little man investor. 

He leaned HEAVILY towards more regulation of investors on “APPS” and social media, even though he said we do have a right to free speech unless it crossed certain thresholds. His answers to questions heavily leaned towards the larger firms. There was no serious indication that he would be cracking down on the RIDICULOUS naked shorting of the markets (which by the way NOBODY wanted to address, which in and of itself says it all). 

This dog and pony show was completely read off of a script verbatim. It was a complete embarrassment on many levels. I highly suggest each and every one of you take 4 hours (useless) out of your day to see if you honestly feel Gary Gensler, Congress, FINRA and the DTCC has your back afterwards.

Let's quickly recap the Cyberdunk 2077 release:

* Awesome teaser trailer 8 years ago.
* Insane hype train accelerating over the years:
   * I mean just look at videos like this from 2019: [WhatAPromoVidSoCoolDisGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2KozvzdKr4)
   * Keanu Reeves
* Stock hits $128
* Release postponed to December
* Stock drops to $88, rises again to $119
* Release:
   * Bugs bugs bugs
   * Bad graphics on old consoles
   * Big shitstorm
* Stock dips and dips and dips and dips… Now around $42

**Ok just sounds like they totally botched it. But did they?**

1. Bugs everywhere..  
Does anyone remember the Witcher 3 release though? It was also pretty buggy. Ok, maybe not AS much. But still, CD Project has a history of releasing buggy games and fixing the issues later on. Witcher 3 is now one if not the most iconic RPG games. Search [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/36ewbt/official_bug_thread/?sort=confidence), browse [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpAGtIdANK4) or whatever to get an impression of the bugs.  
For Cyberpunk they have [plans for fixing and free DLCs already released](https://en.cdprojektred.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-our-commitment-to-quality/). Given their history, I trust CD Project to fix the game and make it one of the best.
2. [13.7 mio. copies sold in 2020](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/management-board-report-on-the-activities-of-the-cd-projekt-group-and-cdc-projekt-sa-in-2020.pdf) (65)  
This is the number of copies sold in 20 days. To put this into some relation, CD Project sold [20 mio. of Witcher 1, 2 and 3 together](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2016/03/FY_2015_results_presentation.pdf) (4) in the whole year of 2015, the release year of Witcher 3 (which was released in may, so 8 months of selling).  
Also worth mentioning: [Only with the pre-orders](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/current-report-no-652020.pdf)  of digital distribution channels (\~8 mio.) CD Project covered all  development cost of Cyberpunk 2077 as well as all marketing and  promotional cost until the end of 2020. So the revenue on more than 5  mio. is solely going into the pockets.  
So overall some damn good  numbers. And there is still potential. Consider that some degenerates  like myself didn't buy the game yet but probably will, when most bugs  are fixed.  
CD Project also wants to massively extend the Cyberpunk universe.
3. The refunding campaign  
Following up to the disastrous release, CD Project started a refund campaign for Cyberpunk 2077.  
I couldn't find the number in official documents, but [some sources](https://www.ign.com/articles/cdpr-issued-some-30000-refunds-for-cyberpunk-2077) say 30 000 copies were refunded.  
This is 0.2% of the sold copies!! Doesn't look like a bad game to me. I wouldn't be worried if the refund numbers would exceed 1% or more, and even that is so far from where we are. Sounds a lot for shitstorm and media cryout. 
4. The hack  
[CD Project got hacked](https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660)! And the attackers stole the source code from Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk!  
Ok, cool down. Pick up your banana again. CD Project gives a shit about  copy protection. None of their games have any, because they believe that  people who love the games will pay for them. Their Backups weren't compromised. So again just negative media coverage.
5. The Witcher  
Is not suddenly gone. The games sell and there is more in the pipeline. A  next gen version of Witcher 3 and an AR mobile game (hunting monsters in  the real world instead of throwing Pokeballs at them) are announced  this year.  
You probably also watched the Netflix series in your  basement, missing some action of your wife and her boyfriend upstairs.  It was the most successful series on Netflix until then. CD Project has  all rights on Witcher. So guess what's gonna happen when the second  series is released in August.
6. The financials  
I don't want to overload your brain cells. Just let me tell you the company is rock solid. Liabilities could be paid right away. Net margin of >30% since 2015.  
If you think you can handle more numbers, check the [report](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/consolidated-financial-statement-of-the-cd-projekt-group-for-2020.pdf).
7. Conclusion  
It seems to me that the sky high anticipation paired with the disappointment was the best food for the media, journalists, click baiters and everyone who could profit from a dramatic coverage. And boy they did. If it was such a  bad game, more people would have used the refund campaign, so it was probably trashtalked it into oblivion.  
That's why the numbers speak a different language. Cyberpunk seems to be a success and the Witcher was always gonna continue.  
So looking at the whole picture, what has happened, what is going on and what is coming, I can only see this stock going upward.
8. Positions  
Holding 30 @ $87.08, 30 @ 74.49, and now bought another 30 @ $47.27

**TL;DR**

* Cyberpunk was financially a huge success, despite the bad media coverage.
* The Witcher will fuel the rockets with a Witcher 3 overhaul, a mobile AR game release and the second season on Netflix.
* Solid financials.
* Ticker is OTGLF
* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you find anything about the short interest, that would be something interesting to look at, too. I just found [this](https://otcshortreport.com/company/OTGLF/), stating that the daily percentage of volume shorted in April in some  days was <2% and some days >96%.

**TL;DR:** Civilians can trade with high leverage (over 6x) in risk-based portfolios (or portfolio margin accounts). There is no magic to it, and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4-6x using directional leverage (CFDs or Total Return Swaps). Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open. The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day. More on this below.

**Introduction**

Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management (specifically, hedging) to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account. I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.

**Prerequisites**

This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post:

option pricing

option strategies

dynamic hedging

portfolio margin

TIMS margin

margin stress test

risk convexity

weighted vega

option market makers strategies

long term short term capital gains tax

You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.

**Core trade concept**

You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets.

Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept.

Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio.

A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL.

I look at my account from three angles:

1. PnL
2. Risk (margin requirements)
3. Tax liability

There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first.

You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third.

My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns.

In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.

**Application**

You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV > zero from an accounting point of view).

Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc.

An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs).

The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view).

The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short).

If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).

**Pros**

You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in.

You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a **con**.

If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.

**Cons**

Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses.

A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions).

Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute.

The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.

**Conclusion**

The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8).

Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education.

This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots.

Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.

However, as the price has been slowly pissing away the financials are looking more and more sexy.

Q1 2021 financials where absolutely amazing for Corsair with 530 million in revenue and 46 million net earnings. This coincides with the huge increase in advertising budget of the company spending millions on partnerships with twitch and youtube creators.

n6gwqk,,wallstreetbets,post,1620333165,"Advice to new investors, from a new investorAdvice to New Retards from another relatively new Retard.

I am going to list out a handful of things that even though I had done a fair amount of research before opening up a trading account. It was not nearly enough, and below are things that I in hindsight wish I would have read somewhere or seen advice on.

· More often than not, when you read news on a company and expect the price to soar because of that news. That news is probably already reflected in the price for that stock. The best example of this is DKNG for my portfolio. The news for this company in Q1 has been fucking outstanding. New partnerships and or exclusive partnerships with almost every major sports organization. New states legalizing Sportsbooks. Cathie Wood buying a large number of shares for her portfolios. Fantastic YoY growth. Purchasing or expanding their media footprint. At face value, all of this news should have them trading at least 40% higher than what they were at for Jan 1. But it isn’t it is trading at about 15% higher than what it was then. As I mentioned, more often than not all of that news is factored into the stock days if not weeks before any public announcement or article publishing that.

· Take your fucking profits and cut your fucking losses. The best advice I have ever heard is to set your profit/loss orders. 20% for-profit and 16% for loss. Set it and forget it. Period. Or if you are comfortable taking any profit at all, take your 5% and exit. Whatever you think is best for your financial situation and portfolio. Or if you are long on the stock, don’t even look at the daily for it. If you know your entry, and you know where you want to exit. The same thing set it and forget it. Looking at the daily will only cause stress. Trust me, I fucking know. RKT is my example of that. I currently have 25 shares in RKT on an AVG entry of $22.8. But I should’ve taken my fucking profit when it peaked at $43 in March. Pocketed my gains, and entered back in after it dropped and averaged out. But no, I held. I held hoping their Q1 earnings would drive it higher than what it was in March. Guess what. It fucking didn’t. It dropped to a little over $19 per share today. I am long on RKT, as they are going to be an absolute juggernaut for the next 5 years in their industry. BUT I should’ve taken my profits and re-entered

· I’m retarded. You’re retarded. We’re all fucking dipshits and if you think you’re not then you’re probably the biggest dipshit in here. Now that is out of the way. Don’t invest in a stock/company if you don’t understand what the fuck they are actually doing. MVIS is that example for me. Read pages and pages of honestly still very good DD. But it might as well of been written in hieroglyphs because I didn’t and don’t understand a god damn word of it. Something about LIDAR and some beep boop shit that is going to enable robots and cars to detect shit. I don’t know. I don’t understand it. But  I invested, and closed a position in a different great company because it was trending in the cesspool of mouth breathers. Entered at $22 and cut my losses at $16 per share. YTD, because of what I threw at it. It is my most significant loss and I am sure they are a great company with a giant upside in the future, but I don’t understand it and won’t be opening another position on it unless my low functioning brain can eventually process what they are doing (probably not going to happen). Oh well, it taught me a great lesson.

· Trying to play earnings is risky, to say the least. Again, RKT is a great example of that. Honestly, their earnings report was overall very good, and they only slightly missed their projections. But because they did miss it, it has fallen around 20%. Also, even if the company beats its earnings projection, it may not increase a whole lot. If any, and for some odd fucking reason it could even go drop. Look at AMD, that ticker confuses me almost as much as DKNG. AMD is a great long stock as well, but good luck trying to predict what the fuck it is actually going to do before, or after earnings. I mean shit, really even daily.

· Do you own god damn DD. Read every DD post on here, and take it with a grain of salt. More often than not the DD is pretty well written and researched, but it is almost always written by someone who has a large number of shares or portfolio % in that. It’s like listening to a Wendy’s employee tell you that they have the best fries, and no other fries compared to theirs. Well yeah, mother fucker you work there and have a vested interest in trying to convince me of how great your fries are.

· Figure out your own goals with your portfolio. Whether that’s you being a daily trader and closing and opening positions daily or picking your stocks to go long in. Or split your portfolio in half and do both. Up to you, but you need to know what you are trying to achieve with it and have a clear path laid out of doing so.

· If you are able to, put everything you can into a Roth IRA, it is exempt from capital gains tax. You can put a maximum of $6,000 in it per year. Do that before you put any money anywhere else. You have to have it longer than 5 years before you should even think about withdrawing any money out of it. But really, you shouldn’t withdraw anything out of it ever. Have an individual account with fuck around money, or to have access for a rainy day or emergency funds or whatever. You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly, but that just is what it is.

· ETF’s are boring as fuck and not sexy, but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky as you are investing in a wide variety of stocks that you might not be able to afford individually. Take BETZ for example. For most investors, especially as they are starting off you may not have the expendable income to just outright purchase stocks like PENN for example. But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already have shares on them.

· Paper trading is an underutilized resource. It allows you to experiment in investing without legitimately risking anything financially. Do it. Do it even if you’ve been trading for a while. It is an excellent technique for perfecting or just training yourself on the market.

· Finally, you’re not DeepFuckingValue. He researched for months if not years and followed GME as in-depth as he could and read pretty much everything readily available on them. Researched Board members, followed market trends, and ultimately, he had fuck around money where he could throw a significant amount of money at it. Everything, obviously, worked out in his favor but it could have just as easily not. GME could have very easily gone bankrupt as there were a lot of really intelligent people who thought they could and cited them and their business model as very similar to Blockbuster. Chances are you are not going to do the amount of research on any stock, with as much as he did for GME. Don’t pretend you will, and don’t lie to yourself saying you will. I joined here in January, and have learned so much. But again, I’m a fucking idiot and so are you.

&#x200B;

If you have any advice, you wish you would've been told when you first started. Please add it.

&#x200B;

Edit Note:

 I originally listed TQQQ as an example in the portion of ETFs. Since this post was written as a post for beginners and it was discussed and agreed upon that TQQQ is poor example of that and not a beginner ETF, I changed it to BETZ instead and instead of citing TSLA or NVDA. I list PENN as an example.","['AMD', 'TSLA', 'NVDA']"

n72861,,wallstreetbets,post,1620404091,"Bank stocks will ""pay back"" billions of dollars to investors in 2021Hi,

It looks like banks have released piles of cash in reserves they had set aside for bad loans that didn't happen. And now this money will trickle down to investors through a record amount of announced buybacks for 2021. This substack story gives a great explanation of the mechanics of how this will play out:

[https://meanwhileinmarkets.substack.com/p/-the-fed-unleashed-a-mega-bullish](https://meanwhileinmarkets.substack.com/p/-the-fed-unleashed-a-mega-bullish)

Key part:

Now, let’s look at the news from this whole new perspective.

The Fed let America’s six largest banks buy back as much as $11 billion worth of shares this quarter. That’s a lot, but there’s a good chance it’s just the tip of the iceberg.

For example, JP Morgan (JPM) alone is drawing up to buy $30 billion of its shares in 2021. For perspective, that’s 20% more than its previous record in 2019. (When JPM soared a record 42% in a year.)

And all this should be music to investors’ ears for a couple of reasons.

For one, the Fed tips off that banks may have set aside way more cash than this crisis will call for. And part of this pile could quickly end up in shareholders’ pockets through buybacks.

In fact, the banks have been paying out just 30% of their profit to shareholders in dividends. And [a Bloomberg analysis](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) shows the Fed’s “allowance” can bring their payouts to 100% of banks’ average net income over the past year.

Second, Wall Street banks have largely lagged the market during Covid. But buybacks and a growing appetite for recovery stocks (including banks) could launch bank stocks into a catch-up rally next year.

“That’s been one of the real missing points to the bank stocks: their ability to go in and buy back their own stock,” Gerrard Cassidy, Head of US Bank Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets told CNBC.

n74flh,,wallstreetbets,post,1620409752,"Float, short interest and what it all meansI see a lot of bad assumptions made over the gme is 120% shorted statement.

Float is a pool of available shares to short not the total number of shares of that stock. These are typically owned by market makers and brokers or the company itself.

Short interest is the amount of this float being borrowed by traders to short.

Naked shorting that pushes SI above 100% is simply borrowing shares not available to borrow because someone like me owns those shares.

So when a stock is shorted 120% of its float, people did illegal naked shorting and borrowed shares not available to borrow, shares privately owned. Nothing new got created.

A squeeze can happen when the price is driven up by enough people trying to find shares to cover their short that are not currently available to borrow as more people like you and me buy and hold actual shares or ""boomer shares"" as zoomers call them, further decreasing the available float(causing a low liquidity issue in the stock) and their broker margin calls them (so the price goes up until it hits what someone like me or maybe you will sell their share for) 

Buying options only will likely NEVER trigger a squeeze..

Also if a short trader gets upside down enough.. they can always declare bankruptcy and settle (if they owe more than they are worth) then nothing much happens to the stock price and mr. Bankruptcy isn't going to buy a single one, his debts are clean depending the chapter declared.

He stood up to credit suisse and made sure Meg fully understood 3.2M apes own the float! They along with their leadership procoded the liquidity to run the tables and stave off bankruptcy and now thanks to these efforts have more liquidity than ever in the life of AMC
As I think back on today's ER there has only been two CEOs that have publicly thanked all of the apes for saving their company and not letting them be another Toys r us 
GMEs RC and AMCs AA.
I could be wrong but I haven't heard NIO ceo or SNDL ceo or even Blackberry CEO be so grateful to the apes and blue collar workers of America for keeping their companies in business 
For this reason in the morning I will begin liquidating my portfolio and placing my money where people and companies appreciate us investors and us retards and autists
AMC has already publicly stated apes own the float to the tune of 4/5 that's over 80%. Imagine if every ape believed in Top Gun or their first video game or their first cop a feel in the AMC theaters growing up..And felt they believed in keeping the American and European, Korean, Chinese, and so on dreams alive and dug deep and bought just one 9 dollar share of AMC or a fractional of GME with 9 dollars how the world might be in a few days. I by no means mean everyone buy cause if you don't believe in the people and companies that believe in us and have our backs cause we have theirs and have great fundamentals then yeah you shouldn't buy into it. But ... if you believe in fundamentals if you like the companies and their leadership and you,  just like them want to see the blue collar workers of America and Europe take back what we have built then buy a share to show back your appreciation. I truly believe AMC and GME might be in fact the first companies ever owned by the hard working people of America and not the ones in the ivory towers! Aaron said it best a year ago if I wanted to speak to our investors I'd go to China and speak with a company or two out there that owned us.. today I speak on behalf of the 3.2M redditors and apes on youtube and who knows.... if enough people like the stocks you might just make some money along the way!

n650iw,gx57ses,wallstreetbets,comment,1620305594,"New Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Gary Gensler will testify before the House Financial Services Committee  on Thursday. This is the third House hearing focused on [GameStop](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GME), but this is Gensler’s first appearance as chairman before the Committee.

Gensler’s  prepared testimony indicates he will address a broad range of topics  around Gamestop and protection of investors, including:

## ‘Gamification’ of trading.

Gensler  will begin his testimony on the increasing gamification of trading,  which he defined as trading that has “game-like features” — such as  points, rewards, leaderboards, bonuses, and competitions — to increase  engagement.

“Many of these features encourage investors to trade  more,” Gensler said. “Some academic studies suggest more active trading  or even day trading results in lower returns for the average trader.”

Gensler  said he has asked his staff to prepare a request for public input: “We  need to ensure investors using apps with these types of features  continue to be appropriately protected.”

## Payment for order flow

Many  brokers now send their orders to market makers in exchange for  payments, a process known as “payment for order flow.”  The market  makers can either execute the orders directly or pass it on to an  exchange or other trading venues.

Because higher levels of trading  generate more payment to brokers, Gensler asked: “Do broker-dealers  have inherent conflicts of interest? If so, are customers getting best  execution in the context of that conflict? Are broker-dealers  incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently than is in  those customers’ best interest?”

Gensler  did not directly address these questions, but implied the recent  enforcement action against Robinhood was a warning sign. “Robinhood  explicitly offered to accept less price improvement for its customers in  exchange for receiving higher payment for order flow for itself. As a  result, many Robinhood customers shouldered the costs of inferior  executions; these costs might have exceeded any savings they might have  thought they’d gotten from a zero commission.”

## Equity market structure

That  payment for order flow has turned into a lucrative business. Gensler  says about 38% of equity trading volume is executed by those  off-exchange wholesalers. Citadel Securities, Gensler noted, has  publicly stated that it executes about 47% of all retail volume.

Gensler  asked if this concentration was consistent with the SEC’s mandate to  promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.  “History and economics  tell us that when markets are concentrated, those firms with the  greatest market share tend to have the ability to profit from that  concentration,” he said, “I’ve asked staff to look closely at these  issues to determine which policy approaches may be merited.”

Citadel  Securities declined to comment. However, in testimony in February of  this year in the House of Representatives, Citadel founder Ken Griffin  said: “With respect to payment for order flow, we simply play by the  rules of the road. Payment for order flow has been expressly approved by  the SEC. It is a customary practice within the industry. If they choose  to change the rules of the road, we need to drive on the left side  versus the right side, that’s fine with us.”

## Short positions: Should they be disclosed?

Hedge  funds and other investors who hold significant stock positions are  required to report long positions on a quarterly basis, but those who  hold short positions are not. 

That has led to calls that short  sellers should also be required to disclose their positions:  “Enhancing  disclosures could improve market efficiency and end some wild  speculation (and misinformation) about short selling and short  positions,” Tyler Gellasch, executive eirector of Healthy Markets, said  in an open letter to Gensler.

Gensler told the committee he has  directed SEC staff to prepare recommendations for the SEC’s  consideration on short selling disclosure.

## The Archegos mess

Though  unrelated to GameStop, Gensler also brought up the failure of Archegos  Capital Management and the losses incurred by several banks that  provided prime brokerage services to them. The “core” of the problem,  Gensler said, was Archegos’ use of total return swaps based on  underlying stocks, and the significant exposure that the prime brokers  had to the family office.

Gensler said he has asked his staff for  recommendations on whether to include total return swaps and other  security-based swaps under new disclosure requirements. 

## Social media hype

Gensler  also raised concerns that wrongdoers will attempt to use social media  to hype stocks or manipulate markets.  He offered no specific  suggestions, but said that “This is an area for which we will continue  to deepen our understanding, resources, and capabilities.”

## Margin requirements

Gensler  noted that “at least one firm didn’t have sufficient liquidity to meet  margin calls and had to fundraise within hours to meet $1 billion-plus  obligations, and several brokers chose to shut down customer access to  trading.”  Gensler said this raised questions about whether margin  requirements are sufficient, and whether broker-dealers have appropriate  tools to manage their liquidity and risk. “I’ve asked staff to look at  these issues carefully,” he said.

## Shorter settlement period

Stocks  currently take two days after a trade is made to settle, a convention  known as “T + 2.”  Gensler noted that “the longer it takes for a trade  to settle, the more risk our markets assume” and that the technology  exists to eventually shorten the settlement cycle to T + 1 or even  same-day settlement.  “I’ve directed the SEC staff to put together a  draft proposal for the Commission’s review on this topic,” he said.

## Where is the SEC going?

While  Gensler’s comments lacked specifics, analysts noted that his comments  clearly indicated the direction he was taking the SEC on these issues.

“This  is the first time he has come out, and he is pretty negative on payment  for order flow and the concentration of market makers,” Rich Repetto  from Piper Sandler told me, noting his remarks were “troublesome for  e-brokers and market makers.”

Repetto also said not to mistake the  lack of specifics for lack of direction:  “When he says he is  ‘directing’ his staff he is implying there is going to be some kind of  action,” noting that the committee will now expect some kind of update  on what the SEC is doing in the coming months.

Indeed, Gensler told the committee his staff would be publishing a report on market events over the summer.

Gensler  also left the door open to enforcement actions against those violating  SEC rules:  “While I cannot comment on ongoing examination and  enforcement matters, SEC staff is vigorously reviewing these events for  any violations. I also have directed staff to consider whether expanded  enforcement mechanisms are necessary.”",

While stopping short of calling these assets overvalued, JPow did acknowledge that as long as rates stay low, these values seem to be justified. So I guess that as long there is no need to raise rates that current valuations across almost all asset classes are ok.

It's me, the [butt plug gay bear](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) from a few weeks ago. Remember when PLUG was over 30 bucks a share? Good times, I could get the June $20 puts for like 50 cents. Not anymore!

I want to talk to you today about how PLUG makes its money. The usual way to answer this question is by reading the latest 10-K -- but PLUG still hasn't filed a 10-K for 2020 despite being [10 days](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921038399/tm219753d3_8k.htm) from losing compliance with NASDAQ listing rules and risking being de-listed. This would be bad for the stock.

The 10-K (people in the industry* call it just a ""K"" for short) is pretty long and boring anyway, but luckily the SEC makes companies file financial statements every quarter, so we can look at [the Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm) to see what PLUG was doing during the first 9 months of 2020.

Take a look at the Statement of Cash Flows on page 7. The first column of numbers indicates how much money PLUG got or made from doing stuff over those 9 months, with regular numbers meaning they made money and numbers in (parentheses) meaning they used money. In the course of doing business stuff, PLUG burned an astonishing amount of cash -- something like $182 million, which I get by adding the ""net cash used in operating activities"" line to the ""purchases of property, plant and equipment"" and ""purchases for construction of leased property"" lines. They also spent another $40 million on acquisitions. All that money has to come from somewhere. But if it's not coming from business activities, then where?

Look no further than the ""net cash provided by financing activities"" line -- a robust $590 million. More than half of that is from ""proceeds from public offerings, net of transaction costs"" -- selling stock. How does Plug Power make its money? By selling stock (and issuing convertible debt).

If you go back and look at the [2019 K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020002267/plug-20191231x10k.htm) -- sorry, I know it's long -- they will tell you outright that this is the only way they've ever made money: ""We have not achieved operating profitability in any quarter since our formation."" They've lost $1.4 billion in their lifetime as a public company, according to the Q. But they think they're on the right track: ""In order to achieve profitability, we must successfully execute our planned path to profitability in the early adoption markets on which we are focused."" 

So let's talk just a bit about those early adoption markets. If you know anything about PLUG, you likely know that they sell hydrogen fuel cell systems (the brand name is ""GenKey"") to Amazon and Walmart for use in forklifts. But you might not know why Amazon and Walmart might be interested in such a thing. This is -- I apologize -- another bit where you have to read a bit more. If you go back to the latest Q and read Note 12, you will see that Amazon and Walmart got warrants -- effectively, call options with a strike price a bit over $1, so effectively shares right now -- to buy these fuel cells from PLUG. Amazon has paid PLUG $200M and gotten 30 million shares in return (currently worth north of $600M) -- whenever the stock was over $8 from 2017 to late 2020, Amazon could turn a profit by buying stuff from PLUG and immediately trashing it. (That breakeven point for AMZN is now considerably higher, at about $33.) Walmart has paid something like $50 million for 13 million shares, also a nice profit. (Their breakeven is still at $8 -- what does it say about PLUG's products that Walmart isn't buying more of them?)

Where is this money that Amazon and Walmart is making coming from, by the way? Well, it's coming from the people they sell the stock to -- but more broadly it's coming from PLUG shareholders as a group, because the supply of PLUG stock is expanding. 

PLUG is probably not going to de-list from the NASDAQ. They need to raise money from the equity markets to survive, and they can do that much more easily and efficiently on a big exchange than they could on the pink sheets. But they're going to have to restate their accounts from the last few years because of these warrants -- and it's not clear that they'll be able to make such a deal again. If you want to support the transition to clean energy, find a nice cobalt miner or battery company or something; don't try and catch this falling knife.

*Despite [some guesses in the comments of my last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/gu03v8s/) investing's just my hobby.

n6b5f9,,wallstreetbets,post,1620318178,"$ASTS a global mobile broadband solutionFirst of all, I am young and full of cum, I started gambling in 2020 before the pandemic and have been looking for high potential long-term plays ([peaked at $1 million](https://ibb.co/hm27s7f), after starting with 1k). u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT is a big inspiration (show us the loss porn dude).

Today, I will cover $ASTS, [AST Space Mobile](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf). The company will provide 5G capabilities to regular cellphones from space, they target the 5 billion phones moving in and out of coverage every day or in monetary terms $1T in TAM.

*Why should you care?*

The recent market hit to high growth/speculative plays has not spared ASTS. This has put the stock at a relatively attractive valuation at approximately $1.2B (cheaper than for PIPE investors who bought in at $1.4B).

The company represents the most asymmetric risk/reward play on the market right now. It will either 20x-100x or go bust. Let me explain if they get only 1% of their TAM, which is ~$10B then at a cheap (assuming about 80% net margin, thanks to their 90% EBITDA margin) P/E ratio of 12x ([telecom industry average is 30x according to Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)), it gives the company a $96B market capitalization, representing an 80x opportunity.

*Alright… 100x if everything goes well, right?*

Yes, let me tell you why I and many others (some incredible DD from other investors like u/apan-man) think that the company will succeed. Because this is a highly speculative play and will give you a VC-like risk/reward exposure, I analyzed it like a VC using the BMC (desirability, feasibility, and viability).

**Desirability**

*Targeted Segment*

Their satellites will offer services to large telecom companies, which will help telecom companies expand their subscriber base and have a unique competitive advantage against other carriers. Think of AST’s satellites like 5G towers in space.
Of the currently 5B existing end users, the company has 800M subscribers under exclusivity agreements with companies like Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten, Telefonica, Ooredoo, Telstra, and others.

To put this a bit into perspective, the only other company really trying to achieve that is [Lynk](https://lynk.global/), but they have only $10M in funding compared to $464M for ASTS, and currently do not have any commercial agreements.

*Customer Relationships & Channels*

All the customer relationship services, as well as sales efforts, are done by the carriers. Basically, AST provides the 5G capability and the carrier offers it to its subscribers moving in and out of coverage. This is a good reason why the future cost structure of ASTS is so attractive.

*Value Proposition*

Designed to eliminate coverage gaps and enable billions of people globally to stay connected through their mobile phones.
Imagine watching hot tub streams on the plane.

**Feasibility**

*Key Partners*

In the value chain, AST designs, integrates and tests the satellites while their subsidiary Nanoavionics builds the main components.
They will use any available launch services such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, Ariane, etc. The fact that they have a wide array of choices available greatly reduces successful launch risks. Moreover, the main reason why the space-based applications industry will absolutely explode in the coming years is the ever-decreasing launch costs ([price to send a kg of payload in space](https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/images/rocket-launch-costs-trend.jpg)).

Regarding financial and strategic partners, the company has received funding from Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung in previous rounds as well as in the PIPE 12-month lock-up.

*Key Activities*

AST will design and integrate the satellites. The company’s CEO Abel Avellan is also a big believer in creating huge barriers to entry, they patent a lot of the key elements of their business model.

Of course, their biggest focus is getting the service up and running by 2023. Abel is also working on new wireless carrier agreements. To give you an idea, on average 1 telecom adds around 200M subscribers.

Future agreements won’t be mutually exclusive (like with Vodafone), so they can add as many carriers as they want.

*Key Resources*

Talent, technology, and funding.

Abel Avellan is not much of a salesman, but he is a genius, he seeded AST and was the main contributor to a lot of the technologies that enable the 5G satellites to work.

As mentioned previously, they managed to attract funding from Vodafone, American Tower, and Rakuten. Vodafone spent nearly 18 months doing due diligence on AST’s technology and has concluded that it works.

For further funding, ASTS is participating in the [$9B 5G rural fund for America](http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&f_number=SATPDR2020041300034). They currently have the support of 7 senators (bipartisan) and AT&T. In my opinion, there is the potential for AST to get about $1B in non-dilutive funding from the government, which would significantly accelerate the company’s plan for global coverage.

**Viability**

*Revenue Streams*

Revenues come from an agreement with telecom providers, basically comes in the form of a monthly subscription fee. The end-user is seamlessly connected from towers on the ground to AST satellites.

*Cost Structure*

Because the satellites are in LEO orbit, they will need to be changed every 5-7 years. The company is working on a way to repair/extend the lifetime of existing satellites.

Now let's talk about an important topic: Risk.

**Risk**

*Tech(nichal/nology) risks*

* Launch delays for BW3 (final full-size prototype) might increase costs. especially as they are not the main ride on the launch vehicle. This is a risk in the short term as the launch is scheduled for Q4 2021.

* Technology does not work. While I think this has been largely minimized after the successful launch of BW1, there are some smarter people that believe it is both effective and amazing.

* The company does not get licenses to operate the frequencies in target countries. Abel and the Board of Directors are very well connected and they have the support of huge telecom companies like Vodafone.

*Commercial risks*

* End-users do not see value in extended coverage from their current carriers. Difficult to see why that would be the case.

* Telecom companies do not see value in AST's offering. AST Space Mobile has already a lot of agreements in place that suggests otherwise.

From a risk perspective, technical and technological risks are quite high and are the big reason why the stock has not priced in the potential upside. The company could literally go to 0 (or close to it if they can sell some of their techs/patents/etc.). However, I believe the company offers a unique risk/reward ratio that is difficult to find on the market.

**The long-term play**

Shares, shares, shares.

**The short-term play**

The stock has been severely beaten down and could regain some momentum in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the stock has a relatively small float and could be very explosive on any news, such as new carrier agreements, analyst coverage, etc.
Abel Avellan has mentioned that they are in the process of signing a new 500M subscribers’ agreement and the silent period ends this Friday.

TL;DR $ASTS is the most asymmetric play on the market right, either 100x or 0x in a few years

&#x200B;

This is a transcript of the question from Rep. David Scott (GA-13):

&#x200B;

>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>The question before us today is this: How can we on the Financial Services Committee ensure that our investors can both have access to our markets, but also are able to participate in our markets investing safely? You see when erroneous and inaccurate information posted on social media sites has the ability to broadly influence investors and move the market sometimes drastically. This, gentleman, poses a serious question for you, our regulators. *There is now such a huge hole in our regulatory process because of GameStop with inexperienced investors relying on unverified information from unqualified social media.*  
>  
>Mr. Cook, let me start with you: *\[1\] How can we effectively regulate the impact of new technology social media sites as they pertain to inexperienced investors? \[2\] And also, how do we treat that investment advice that we're getting from unqualified people on social media? \[3\] And then the real question, who is held accountable when that investment advice leads to market volatility like we've seen and massive losses for our investors?* I'd like for the three of you: Chair Gensler, Mr. Cook, Mr. Bodson... Answer this important question in the three parts that I outlined it for. This is what the American people need answers to from you regulators. Mr. Cook, why don’t you start.  
>  
>***Mr. Robert Cook, President and CEO of FINRA:***  
>  
>Well, thank you thank you congressman for that question. I think you raised some really profound questions about where technology and other aspects of investor behavior may be going and how does that fit within the current regulatory regime. When we talk about statements by people on social media and other places, just to be clear, FINRA doesn't regulate that environment and we would look to the SEC in, sort of, understanding whether existing authorities around concepts like manipulation or providing investment advice might apply.  
>  
>*I do think that what we have also seen, though, and your point about retail investors making decisions without an intermediary or financial advisor is an important one. As we see more of that happen we are seeing a lot of that happen. I think we need to ask whether the existing regime is adequate in that regard.*  
>  
>***Rep. David Scott (GA-13):***  
>  
>Let me quickly get to Chair Gensler. I’ve worked with him when he was chair of the CFTC. Chair, how do we hold somebody accountable? Answer this for me, as Mr. Cook just said, the SEC he said is the one responsible. How do we hold somebody... Well, what do we do about this, Chair Gensler?  
>  
>***Chair Gensler of the SEC:***  
>  
>I think you raise a good point. I know like, probably like me, it's not about somebody's free speech rights on social media but if somebody is trying to manipulate a market to defraud the market through social media and in our rapidly changing technology, it could be computers and not even humans, by the way, it could be computers communicating in. *So the SEC is a cop on the beat. We're gonna vigorously lean in against individuals and companies to try to assess. But we'll have to update our resources too to be able to see \[those\] relationships.*

n6bvcw,,wallstreetbets,post,1620320072,"VIAC massively undervalued right now and has had an amazing earnings reportVIAC (ViacomCBS) is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. 

As of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.
VIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.

The most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.

The only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each

TL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff. Huge growth of earning from streaming service Paramount+, and subscribers are only growing, and debt is dropping.","['NFLX', 'VIAC']"
