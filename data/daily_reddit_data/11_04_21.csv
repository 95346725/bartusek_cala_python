Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I am trying to be a responsible investor and vote on the issues presented to shareholders for various annual meetings. The problem is that I really don't know how to effectively find information on the people and proposals beyond the recommendation of the board.

For example, Ford ($F) is holding a meeting and presented this proposal, on which the board is recommending a ""no"" vote:

*Relating to Consideration of a Recapitalization Plan to Provide That All of the Company's Outstanding Stock Have One Vote Per Share.*

Is there a place or method that people use to find independent recommendations on shareholder voting? Obviously, this would be mostly for big companies; I don't expect much info on an OTC junior mining venture, etc.

Thanks for any advice! And if I am asking the wrong questions, please feel free to point me in the right direction.

moksb8,,stocks,post,1618117485,"The Economy is not the Market, or why the S&P 500 could easily NOT hit 10,000 before the end of the decadeRecently there have been a lot of arguments to the effect that ""US companies will keep doing great the next decade and so stocks will do great as well."" Over the long-run (several decades), this is certainly true: stocks represent ownership in a company, and as the earnings of the company increase so will its stock price. However, in the short-run (a decade or less) the performance of a stock is also driven by *investor valuation and confidence*, measured by the price-to-earnings ratio. It is perfectly possible for a company to increase its earnings, but for its stock to move sideways or even drop if investor enthusiasm for the stock falls.

For example, from 2000 to 2010 the [US real GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) grew from $12.9 trillion to $15.4 trillion, even after taking the hit from the recession in 2008. However, over that same time period the S&P 500 index [dropped](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices/table/by-year) 300 points from 1,425 to 1,123. What on earth happened? The problem was investor confidence and P/E was at an all time high in 2000 at the top of the dot-com bubble, which then plummeted after the bubble burst, and then plummeted again during the global financial crisis. Even though the US economy did well that decade, the S&P 500 did not.

Of course, I cannot predict the future, but investors should be prepared if history repeats itself the next decade. The current S&P 500 [Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) (CAPE) is at an almost record high of 37. Assuming a historically consistent growth rate of 10% over the next decade, the S&P 500 will more than double in value. However, if over that decade the CAPE falls to a more realistic historical average of 16, then *all those gains will be wiped out*. It is very possible for the US economy to do great the next decade, but for the S&P 500 to move sideways.

In light of this possibility, what is an investor to do? Oddly enough, my advice is the same as the exuberant post that prompted this reply, but for a different reason. Existing investors at the start of 2000 went nowhere over the next decade, but they performed marvelously the decade after when the S&P more than tripled to its current valuation of over 4000. In fact, 2000 to 2010 was a great decade to invest in the stock market, since you spent 10 long years buying great US companies at a bargain price. If the stock market drops again in the future, you should ride it out and keep investing into index funds or solid companies that will weather the storm and recover once investor confidence increases again.",['SPGI']

Got it. 😎",['SPGI']
moksb8,gu5fqnj,stocks,comment,1618153092,"There's a couple problems here.

First the reason why the s&p was down between those 2 periods is because you chose a year that was part of the financial crisis. Its using an outlier to compare. 2008 financial crisis wiped alot off of the markets as well as the average american wealth.

If you had your money in the s&p vs real estate during that period your investment in the s&p would have recovered much quicker. So its not exactly fair to take these years out of context without comparing it to the entire asset classes you can choose to invest in.

Second, you are assuming the s&p keeps the same companies in the index over a 10 year period.. this is not true. It re-balances 4 times a year getting rid of poor performers and adding new companies that are growing. 

If the index only keeps companies that are growing and removing poor performers than it remains to be seen that vs any other investment its a pretty damn good choice.

In the short term you are right there can be times where the markets are tanking but you need to compare that with other asset classes to see if its outperforming them. In the long run there's no better place to park your money than index funds following the broader markets.",['SPGI']

moj4eh,,stocks,post,1618110643,"CRISPR patenting questionI'm a little flummoxed by the legal side of the CRISPR battle at present so I'm hoping someone on here can shed some light on the situation.

My understanding is that the legal battle for the patent is based on a scientific disagreement over who ""invented"" the use of CRISPR-CAS9 technology for humans. One side demonstrated it's use first in other types of cells, while the other took the logical next step in pushing the tech forward. When I read up on the patent however, it appears to be granting rights to the use of CRISPR on any eukaryotic cell, so I'm really unsure as to why this patent is currently owned by Broad and not the original research team.

In addition to this, since it's looking like Broad (and hence $EDIT) is coming out on top, what are the implications of this for agricultural uses of the technology? As far as I'm aware, EDIT is primarily investing in pharmaceutical based research, but a patent for all eukaryotic usage extends far beyond that. Are they likely to be a solid investment from the agricultural side simply because of the royalties? Or should I be looking elsewhere for more agricultural specific tickers if this is my main interest.",
moj4eh,gu4pbl0,stocks,comment,1618129251,"In time I think there will be an investment from the agricultural side me thinks. Irrc not to long ago - maybe last weekend? Crispr was discussed, and in one of the comments a guy said the patent legal battle could drag out. I can't remember who he thought would win, but one of the 3 companies had in his opinion a dream team - but he had money in all 3 companies as it was to close to call.

He also said that a woman? That used to be involved in one of the companies have started her own, and she has filed for the crispr patent to be used in the argiculter. Her company is still private.

So try see if you can find that post there was some good insides in the comments

moj4eh,gu4qfvj,stocks,comment,1618130378,"They're fighting over who provably did what first.  There was a ruling a few years ago that was supposed to resolve this, I had no idea it was still a question until this weekend.

> Two years ago, the outcome of the first of these interferences seemingly resolved the question, albeit imperfectly: the PTAB decided that the Broad Institute and their collaborators had the rights to eukaryotic CRISPR applications and that rights to CRISPR more generally were owned by the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Vienna and Emmanuelle Charpentier as an individual.

[source](https://endpts.com/the-continuing-crispr-patent-saga/)

They made the distinction for the purposes of settling the dispute, but they failed to take into account one scenario.  If you wanted to use CRISPR in non-eukaryotic cells, you only had to get a patent license from CVC.  However, if you wanted to use CRISPR in a eukaryotic cell, you had to get licenses from both CVC and the Broad, which is a pita.

In other words, you only need one patent license (from CVC) if you want to use CRISPR in bacteria, archaea, viruses, and any other non-eukaryotic cell type.  You need two patent licenses (one from CVC, the other from the Broad) if you want to modify plants, animals, fungi, and pretty much anything else worth modifying.  

Get a license from the Broad if you want to edit anything that can actually generate revenue. 

Get a license from the CVC if you want to edit anything at all.  

So you're required to get two licenses, basically.

> since it's looking like Broad (and hence $EDIT) is coming out on top, what are the implications of this for agricultural uses of the technology?

Those two aren't really related.  Whichever group owns this patent is going to license it to anyone that can use it effectively and responsibly, regardless of if the owner is a pharma group or not.  Agriculture is going to be their second largest patent license revenue stream after pharma itself.

> I'm really unsure as to why this patent is currently owned by Broad and not the original research team.

moufah,,stocks,post,1618160116,"Trading with a margin account but without borrowing and my OWN CASH.Hi Everyone,  


I've been trying to research this and find out but i recently moved to tradestation and i used to be on trading212. In the UK, there is a no settlement law for cash accounts as far as i know. There may be but trading212 didn't have this so therefore i could instantly sell and buy a stock within minutes apart and do this 20 or even 100 times a day, 5 days a week.

  
Because i have moved to US Broker, i have to wait for a settlement date until i can use my cash again which isn't ideal for a day trader. So my question is, can i open a margin account and never ever borrow their money so that way i can avoid any interest fee's and loan fees.  


Would this then allow me to instantly have access to my own cash again after i sell as long as i have 25k minimum at the end of each day? so lets say i purchase a stock and bought $30k worth and then i sell my investments and now i have $35k. On the same day, on a CASH ACCOUNT i would need to wait for the $35k to settle before i can use it again (3 days). IF i have a margin account, can i do the same thing but have the $35k available instantly without having to borrow from my broker?  


TLDR: Can i use a margin account to day trade 100 of trades without paying any margin account fees/loans.  


In advance, thanks for reading and i appreciate it if you would have time to reply :)",

Any buy you do within that period of time is with borrowed money (you have a claim on the money you get from that stock sell but that is all, the money is not there yet, no settlement). 

Lets say you use day 1, $25K to buy and you sell it the same day. You will have $5K left to buy with until the funds of day 1 have been settled.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

mooup7,,stocks,post,1618138034,"A problem with index funds, for new investors.I am new to all of this but I wanted to share my opinion about something that seems controversial.  I'm not sure if it's controversial simply because A. people haven't understood what I'm talking about, B. people are just ignorant, C. both, or D. I'm missing something.  Let me see if I can explain my point properly in this thread and see what I get back.

**In general, dollar cost averaging into index funds is one of the best plays you can make.**  I'm pretty sure we all know this.  No disagreement there on my end.

Time in the market beats timing the market.  Yep, that one checks out, too.

**However**, I think that we're facing an unprecedented time right now when it comes to investing.  A lot of new investors are entering the market, and they're not just putting in $200 every now and then.  No.  A lot of people are going from 0-60 in about 2 seconds.  Why?  A few reasons, I think. Not scientific research and not hard data, but my feel on things:

1. Easy stimulus money.  People not spending as much as they do normally when they could go out pre-corona.
2. The rise of retail investing and commission free trading via Robinhood, etc.
3. The GME and meme stock saga.  People who had never invested before started investing after getting into the market originally via meme stocks.
4. Huge profits being made in last year's (and this year's) bull run.  FOMO.
5. People don't want to hold cash because of inflation fears and trash returns on savings accounts compared to equities or other assets.

All of this means that young people who are sitting on a lot of cash are suddenly dumping a lot of money into the market all at once.  Again, this is not about dollar cost averaging your paycheck over the period of years.  This is about dumping a large percentage of your savings into the market all at more or less the same time.  This is my case, and I don't have the data, but my impression on the ground is that I'm not the only one.  A lot of retailers are getting into the market right now, and they're not getting in small.  Please feel free to corroborate or debunk my observation.

Let's take a hypothetical example of what I mean.  Say a young investor is sitting on savings of about $15,000 that he or she traditionally held in a savings account.  This young investor decides to get into the market in early February after getting their feet wet with GME.

Now, most people would say ""index funds, index funds!""  This is what I came across.  Luckily, I did some thinking for myself.

Imagine if this person dumps $10,000 of their savings (2/3 of their $15,000 total) into SPY.  Could it be a good play?  Yes, it could be.  Historically, would it *always* have been a good play?  No, no it wouldn't have been.  It would not have been a good play in 2000 during the dot com bubble.  It would not have been a good play in 2007.  It would have been a horrible play in a scenario like 1989 Japan.

I know at this point people are going to say ""stop trying to time the market"".  I think this is where people lose me.  I don't recommend timing the market, *per se.*  What I'm recommending is **being fully aware of the risks of betting large sums of your personal savings on the whole market, at one particular point in time.**

This market is weird.  Everybody knows this.  I don't know if I'm bullish or bearish, but I'm definitely cautious.

If you want to dollar cost average your savings into SPY over months and years, I think that's an absolutely wonderful strategy.  I just think noobies should be aware that, hey, maybe dumping 2/3 (or more) of your savings into an index fund all at the same time may not be the smartest play in the world.

What happened was, as a noob, I was reading the same old tired advice: ""index funds, index funds, index funds!""  And I just think there's a very big caveat to that when we're talking about new investors who are not averaging their investment over time, but rather betting large amounts of their savings all at once.

Hope I could explain my concern.",

However, the variance in outcomes with lump sum are much greater, so it can be much better than DCA, but also much worse if there is a crash.

Having looked at that I just lump summed into an index fund. As a young person I have good risk tolerance due to my large time horizon and objectively, lump sum is more often better.

If you think it will crash in the coming twelve months, then DCA.

From this point I will just DCA my new savings of course.",

moijcy,gu447mh,stocks,comment,1618112216,"Are you trading or investing?

With investing, it doesn't really matter what you use.   You're coming up with a strategy, doing a lot of research, and in the end buying a ETF or Stock fairly rairly in the grand scheme of things.    Investing is generally the 'slow and sure wins the race' method.   Most investors actually end up with a broad-market index such as VT or VTI+VXUS or similar as most of their holdings, and then pretty much just buy more of it as time goes on.    Note that this is probably the best strategy if you're looking for long-term returns.

Trading is more like gambling.   I.E. playing poker.   If you're really good you can win, but most people suck at it.   You're picking stocks, trying to buy low, sell high, pick another stock and do the same.   Eventually a lot of traders end up day-trading which basically means buy and sell stocks multiple times a day.   Note that this is a high risk direction and there is a good chance that you'll lose all your money.   

If you're a Trader, you want TD Ameritrade and to use the Think or Swim platform, most likely on the PC, but on mobile it's also acceptable.

If you're an investor, it really doesn't matter what brokerage you use, but Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity are good choices.   I could make a strong case for each one.  

I personally have a Vanguard account for my retirement accounts as I like vanguard funds for this type of investing, and if you're going to buy a company's mutual funds you should probably do it at the company since it typically costs less that way.  

 I have a Schwab account for my normal investing activities, mainly because their investor checking account refunds ATM fees worldwide and so I opened an investor checking account long ago before I needed the brokerage account, and when I started investing that's what I used.  Their trading platform is ok, but if you're an investor it actually works really well.

I have a TD Ameritrade account which is the only one I have margin enabled on, and I have enough assets invested in the account so I can day-trade on occasion.   If it's clear that a market segment is moving strongly one way or the other on a given day, I'll occasionally buy something like TQQQ in the morning and sell it in the afternoon.  Note that I consider this gambling so I don't do this with funds I need for the future.

I haven't spent a lot of time with Fidelity, but I like their fractional ETF purchase options, which I wish schwab has.  I think their zero fee mutual funds aren't as good as the vanguard ones which cost a little more but I feel are worth it.     Others really like Fidelity.",

movlbb,,stocks,post,1618163604,"Why I am excited about Otto Energy- My DDBefore understanding why you should invest in Otto Energy, first you need to understand the driving forces behind rapidly increasing prices in the oil market that is driving up share prices with huge increases. This has led to large profit margins and 100% plus increases in penny stocks like 88 energy, pantheon, etc. That is just to name a few. One of the reasons for this can be attributed to politics. This is not a political post, but it is important to note that politics do play a role in stock prices. With the current US administration, there is a fear of no longer allowing new permits for drilling, something that the Biden administration has already committed itself to. This can lead to high demand for companies that have permits, and potential to find oil, especially those with Alaskan oil permits, something that Otto Energy has (22.5% working interest in the area). This company is not a one trick pony however with drilling sites in the Gulf of Mexico, one that has proven production (C). This is their SM71 drill site in all of its glory.


88 Energy and Otto Energy-Contrast and Comparison

To summarize what happened with 88 Energy recently, let’s just say that 88 Energy had a promise of a potentially significant discovery (Still does, but their season is over and this led to their decline in price. They will return in the fall however and try again. Oil seasons can be complicated, but to put it bluntly these are harsh areas to drill in). Otto energy which is drilling in the same area as Merlin one site of 88 Energy but is closer to potential connection points and trafficking areas which makes their sites potentially more ideal for recovery of said oil. There are known pipelines in the area (Think Trans Alaska pipeline; F), and major corporations like Conoco Phillips nearby as well. They sold one of their projects here to Patheon with (0.5%) royalties on any oil discovered (G), which will be a nice revenue source for passive income in the company as they have other projects that may be more rewarding that they need to fund. 0.5% doesn’t sound like a lot, but this can lead to $5 million or more in royalties (341 million barrels of recoverable oil (F) with the low-price estimate of $3 a barrel and then 0.5% of that amount), something that can make or break an oil company when needing to raise capital for the next venture. These companies live and die by a need to raise capital to fund projects, and this is amount they get with no additional effort on their part.


Point One-Potential High Demand, Low Supply of Shares

Attractive investment point one. On their website they list the top 20 share holders with HBSC custody being number one with an estimated 43.03% of the total existing shares. The other remaining 19 shareholders bring up the total percent to 60.39% leaving 39.42% for shareholders like me and you (B). Now this can be scary due to the fact that there are some major whales in this game, but this is great for short term investors because if this price goes from $0.018 to $0.18, these people are not selling. They are in it for the long-term game for their projects that are years out. Which means for the little guy, there is a lot less supply and a lot more demand. 


Point Two- The Close Catalyst of Talitha’s Results

Attractive investment point two. With the upcoming catalyst of Pantheons Talitha which was purchased from Otto energy, these share prices are not astronomical, or insane, they are in fact very reasonable. The results are expected by April 20th, but already things are going very well. There is always the hope that the share prices can reach higher, and I myself am ever more the dreamer. Realistically speaking however, let us look at the facts. This is not Otto energy’s discovery it is Pantheons. The royalties will be significant for Otto Energy as they will benefit greatly in the long run as the passive income will fund future projects, but it will not be an immediate gush of funds that comes with a major discovery. This will still be great news for Otto Energy and their future, however. The hype in combination with low supply of shares could create the perfect storm for significant share prices increases.


Point Three- With Continuation of Point One, Less Shares Than 88Energy and More Stability

Attractive investment point three. Less shares than that of 88 Energy (D&E for comparison). 88 Energy saw a sharp rise in price due to a potential major discovery. That rise would have been significantly higher, but they have 12.17 billion shares in their public float (E). Their OTC ticker EEENF went as high as $0.089 (E) before their demise and fall. If you sold before the bad news however, if you bought $10,000 early in the excitement that would have been more than $40,000 in the short term. Those are amazing returns. The difference between Otto Energy is that they have significantly less shares than that of 88 Energy (Potential for higher demand and less supply). Otto Energy has 1.41 billion in their public float (D). They also lack the history of hugely disappointing shareholders year after year like 88 Energy has. Having a fraction of the shares with potential good news and increase in trade volume does not make it unreasonable to believe that they could reach $0.10 or beyond. I do not know this for a fact as the market is unpredictable but it’s what I believe.


Point Four-Short Term and Long-Term Investors Unite

Attractive investment point four. They are great as both a short term and long-term investment. In the short term, the news on the upcoming Talitha well is April 20th, something to build up hype towards. Long term, if it is a success, they make royalties that give them income towards future successful projects, and potential discoveries to be made in areas where they can continue with their permits and not get shut out by politics. Something that may become unbelievably valuable in the coming years for those in the oil industry. With major whale shareholders holding 60% of the share prices and increase demand, this price could be astronomical in the short few years down the road with an increase in investments and a growing market cap to boot.


Potential Downside

As always, investing is risky, and oil companies are notoriously risky investments. Just ask those who bought 88 Energy before the fall with bad news. Any news that goes the wrong direction and Otto Energy could temporarily be sub penny again. That means potential huge losses. 88 Energy is a recent and fresh example because those who invested at peak hype lost 80% the next day. That means at the wrong time, your $10000 would be $2500 in valuation. So, invest at your own caution. With Otto Energy they have 1.41 Billion shares in their public float, only a fraction of what 88 Energy had. The good news as well is April 20th (Otto Energies potential catalyst) is nine days away and it’s still early to get in on the hype train as either a short term or long-term investor. Their news should be a lot better as well as Talitha well is much more promising and is further along than Merlin-1 was.


Disclosure

I am not a financial advisor, and these are my own personal opinions. I plan to invest and own a significant portion (for me, you won’t see me in the top 20 lol) of Otto Energy. I also plan to recover my initial investment when the share price is high enough and sit on the remainder as a long-term investment. I believe in this company and their potential for future growth and am extremely excited by their future prospects!

http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202104/07/WS606d1384a31024ad0bab3ef7.html

China's home appliance market is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year as high-end and smart products grow in popularity, according to a report from the China Center for Information Industry Development, a Beijing-based think tank.
The report showed that the retail sales in China's household appliance market reached 833.3 billion yuan (127.4 billion) in 2020, marking a year-on-year decline of 6.5 percent.
But such figures still showcased strong resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said. Affected by the contagion, the first quarter of 2020 saw large-scale contraction with a year-on-year decrease of 35.8 percent in sales of home appliances, but then performance gradually improved. In the fourth quarter, online and offline markets fully recovered, and retail sales reached the highest annual level at 294.1 billion yuan.
It is also worth noting that last year, e-commerce channels accounted for more than 50 percent of retail sales of home appliances for the first time in China. In 2020, online retail sales of home appliances stood at 419.9 billion yuan, marking a year-on-year increase of 14.48 percent and an increase of 3 percentage points over the previous year. By comparison, retail sales of home appliances via offline channels were 413.4 billion yuan－a year-on-year decrease of 21.13 percent.
Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun Report, said earlier that 5G, internet of things and big data have huge development prospects for the home appliance industry.
The effect of online channels on the home appliance industry is growing. E-commerce platforms Tmall and JD have become major selling platforms, and the industry is no longer dominated by offline retailing channels such as Gome and Suning, Hoogewerf said.
The report from the China Center for Information Industry Development also showed that the pandemic has reshaped consumer lifestyles, thus promoting changes in the types of home appliances available.
In 2020, the main 4K/8K smart TVs, which feature large screens, ultra-high definition and artificial intelligence, are becoming increasingly popular, as are healthy high-end air conditioners, premium refrigerators with large capacity and disinfection capabilities, and high-end washing machines. Such a shift in preferences has led to changes in the product structure of China's home appliance market and raised average prices.
Data from JD showed that in 2020, sales volume of TVs priced above 10,000 yuan on its platform increased by more than 70 percent year-on-year, and the market penetration rate of WiFi-enabled smart air conditioners increased from 49 percent in the previous year to 63 percent.
Retail sales of refrigerators priced above 20,000 yuan on JD also soared 132 percent last year. Dryers have become the biggest dark horse in white goods market, with market demand expanding significantly and retail sales increasing by 87.4 percent year-on-year.
Li Wenjie, who analyzes the home appliance market for JD, said the outbreak has changed consumer preferences and shopping habits. Chinese manufacturers have to allocate more resources to better exploit emerging opportunities to increase sales and market share, he said.
At the same time, household appliances, such as dishwashers, handheld vacuum cleaners, hairdressing and beauty products and massage chairs also recorded strong sales, which activated the otherwise sluggish home appliance market and also strengthened the role of home appliances in improving people's sense of satisfaction, the report from the China Center for Information Industry Development added.
Experts said the growing desire for smarter and high-end products is expected to continue in 2021, and it is bringing significant opportunities for Chinese and foreign home appliance makers alike.
German home appliance manufacturer BSH Hausgeraete, known for brands such as Siemens and Bosch, said it saw a ""significantly growing demand"" for dishwashers and dryers in China last year, growing 34 and 59 percent, respectively, as the company was the ""strongest non-Chinese home appliance manufacturer in China"".
In China, a ""significant business recovery"" with high growth rates started in last May, more than compensating for turnover losses during the first three months of 2020, BSH said in a statement.
To meet growing demand for its products, Galanz, a Chinese home appliance maker, also built a new plant in 50 days last year in Foshan, Guangdong province. With four new smart manufacturing lines, the base－which is capable of producing a microwave oven each 6.7 seconds－will have a production capacity of 11 million units annually, Galanz said.
To better pounce on the opportunities, Chinese home appliance maker Haier last month also unveiled a roadmap for the next phase of smart home development.
Demonstrating its leadership in smart home scenarios, solutions and technologies, Haier said it aims to deliver a better experience for users across clothing, food, housing, entertainment and transportation.
For example, Haier's air conditioners will automatically activate a sterilizing function based on detected levels of air pollution to remove seven types of common air pollutants, while releasing negative ions to provide a healthy and comfortable air environment for the family.
""At Haier, we have amassed over 36 years of knowledge from serving more than 180 million households, and gathered observations from tens of millions of connected devices. Our roadmap draws upon this insight and experience into the needs of household users, in order to usher in the future of connected smart home appliances,"" said Wang Ye, vice-president of smart home business at the Haier Home Appliance Industry Group.",

mokb9z,,stocks,post,1618115418,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open. Please don't tell me ""you could pick wrong"" unless your argument is ""you will never pick better than chance,"" which doesn't seem likely to me, but feel free to argue otherwise.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
> The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
> The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
> Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
> Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
> “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
> The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
> Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
> “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
> # Earnings season
> But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
> “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
> The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.
*****
> “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
> Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
> “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
> Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
> The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

> # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

> Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

> The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

> # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

> Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

> In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

> Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

> Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

> # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

> On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

> Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

> **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

> **Raising our 2021 S&P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

> **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

> # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

> Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

> Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

> “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

> A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

> The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

> # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

> Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

> “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

> Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

> 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

> # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

> Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

> Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

JP Morgan has reverse split half of their foreign ETFs, so the price of my position has doubled but I also know that this is considered to be a bad situation for stocks.

But is this bad for ETFs, or more specifically BBJP?

Historically, the ETF has traded between 22 ~ 24, though its hit an ATH over the last month.

ETFs aren't stocks. Their prices don't reflect anything.

A reverse split of a company means its stock is dropped below its initial value, which usually means the company is not doing its job of making money.

A reverse split of an ETF is posturing by the managers who want it not to have the same connotation as a low stock price.",

They go to a bank and buy a contract from them that basically says if stock x goes up in price then I'll take the profits. The bank then goes and buys the stocks and holds it in a portfolio. If the stock goes up they take a fee and give the investor the rest of the profits. If the stock goes down then the investor needs to pay the bank the loss its accumulated from the price it decrease. This all happens without the investor having to buy any shares.

So its basically making huge bets on stocks without having to pay the capital to own them, meaning they can bet much more then they could if they had to buy the shares. It's kind of like a back room leverage deal.

Now imagine on top of this the banks gave the investor loans to reinvest more of this into these bets. So now the investor is basically super leveraged on the contracts.

When VIAC decided to make a stock offering at the market price, the price tanked a little. This got the banks making the bets worried since they are holding the actual stocks. Becuase Hwang was able to make bets with such little capital this made it so his small bets were actually causing a significant portion of the shares of VIAC to be owned by banks selling him these contracts. 

When one of the banks decided to unwind the contract, the price tanked and then another decided to sell and so on until the price plummeted to the point where the losses on the stocks were to large for Hwang to pay back. So now he needs to pay back the loans and also cover the losses for the banks from the price decrease.

It was a vicious cycle that started when VIAC issued shares and the banks decided to nope out of their contracts and dump all the underlying shares that he had bets on making impossible for him to cover as the unwinding of the contracts caused the prices to drop even further. 

The banks basically were lending so much to him through the  swaps and actual loans that it was a recipe for disaster. If one little drop in price happens on one of his bets the entire thing unravels.",['VIAC']

VIX is relatively low.

1. Ranking by % change to Jan vs having a specific order of stocks (alphabetically or any order suggestions)
2. Any stocks to include or exclude. Do let me know in comments.

I think sticking to any specific order would be helpful which will be easy in scanning rather than looking for the % change ranking order everytime. If so, who gets to decide the order ? any thoughts.  I will try to curate on industry type or something.

Please suggest on the above 2nd point. That will be much more helpful for everyone.

Virgin Galactic Investor presentation 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921_ex99-2.htm


So I currently own shares of Virgin Galactic and I am considering buying Rocket Lab as well when it goes public.   Both companies are a pure space play: VirginGalactic focusing on space tourism with a horizontal take off like a plane and Rocket Lab with sending vertical rockets to space with satellite payloads.  They are also working on a rocket to compete with Space X Falcon 9.  

VirginGalactic has a lot of popularity and is more well known, however rocket lab appears to be better in several ways then VirginGalactic.  Better in leadership, financially, execution, and engineering. However I understand that is certainly up for debate.

Thoughts?  Would you invest in Virgin Galactic or RocketLab or both ?  Or neither ?",
mo9329,gu2f8le,stocks,comment,1618078767,"Space tourism is not a near term bet, and hasn't been proven to be viable.

People will hate to hear this but Virgin Galactic is kind of a gimmick. A company doesn't thrive from a handful of rich people using the product one or two times. The TAM is exceedingly low; how many people can afford the time or money to do this? Not everyone with the assets to do so will be a customer.

RocketLab is a real company with revenue, has a product and a growth trajectory in a field that is actually growing. Rocketlab has launched 104 satellites to date.",
mo9329,gu2afhg,stocks,comment,1618076326,Virgin Galactic is currently valued at over 2x Rocket Labs Value. Virgin Galactic also hasn’t had a successful launch in 2 years. Rocket lab is the obvious answer.,
mo9329,gu2ihif,stocks,comment,1618080471,"Hi.  I currently invest in both.  I see Rocket Labs as a space play that could distantly someday turn into an asteroid mining play.  I'm an techno-optimist, and I see that as a necessary and lucrative step for humanity.  I see Virgin Galactic as an airplane 2.0 play that just as they describe could become advanced transportation through hypersonic travel.

I like Virgin Galactic because largely it is the first mover in safe and reliable space tourism.  I'm sure someday that Space X or some company will start doing orbital hotel trips or moon trips.  But, I don't see that as a business threat because Virgin Galactic could lower their price points to market to address a different financial class of customers. 

I like Rocket Labs over the other available rocket companies (though if Space X ever IPOed, I'd switch over my investment very quickly) because Rocket Labs is ahead in execution and also they are vertically integrated and more diversified in possible future potential revenue streams.  It also appears that they are well lead, and I like that Peter Beck is building neutron. I believe that will take risk off of whether other rocket companies like Astra can launch at a lower cost than Rocket Lab's electron.

Between the two I like Rocket Lab more because it seems more of an ethical play.  Virgin Galactic focuses on entertaining the rich.  Though there is upside where it hopefully will get the rich space tourists to care and think more globally about the earth and the environment.",

N - years projected
FV - estimated future market cap / estimated shares outstanding (future price)

mnurtq,,stocks,post,1618016238,"Is there any sensible reason to not short the SPX right now? **Hi!**

First off sorry for the vague title. I don't know if this fits on this sub but I decided to take that risk.

Student here, working part time at an institutional asset manager (and not a native english speaker). I seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything I've learned so far.

I would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why I shouldn't sell and heavily short equities right now. I already lost the biggest part of my portfolio this week but I just don't seem to be able to change my mind. 

To start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it's not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&P 500 (SPX/\^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:

\------------------

1. Index Price and Analyst Expectations
2. Indicators and Benchmarks
3. Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment

The rant is happening in part 3 mostly. I'm not sure if it's allowed but I linked some pictures with imgur-urls. 

\-------------------

**1a) Analysts Targets**

During this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&P to have an upside-potential to 4'200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4'200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3'950-4'000 at the beginning of this year.

[https://imgur.com/3yr48h3](https://imgur.com/3yr48h3) (Short Term Boundaries)

It seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4'200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&P 500 and every single one said ""we remain bullish on US equities"". Their explanations haven't really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we're up that far already.

We hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.

[https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ](https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ) (ATHs marked red (SPX Closing Prices))

With earnings ahead, I don't get how this should be going even further up. Especially on the news we're facing (see further down part 3).

\--------------

**1b) Volume and VIX**

* *Trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity. (Investopedia)*
* *In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.*
* *The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.*

Hmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we're supposedly in 'bullish' situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy? Are the algos idling to meet the ESG-benchmarks or?

[https://imgur.com/K0QP0ny](https://imgur.com/K0QP0ny)  (Daily Trading Volume S&P 500 YTD)

[https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd](https://imgur.com/aYBtNtd) (Rank of 10 last trading sessions (1=Lowest Trading Volume YTD on S&P 500))

We're also at the lowest VIX-Level on the 1Y-Chart which I learned is usually a sell signal (shortterm).

[https://imgur.com/ZaDBIg7](https://imgur.com/ZaDBIg7) (VIX 5Y Chart)

\-----------

**1c) Psychological Factors (SideNote)**

April has been the best performing month for US equities for the last two decades. April was performing net-positive in 14 out of the last 15 years (excluding 2008).

The best performing equities in april are historically european stocks, followed by US stocks.

Knowing that this month started at 3'992 (ATH) I'm having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though.

\-----------

**2) Technicals**

**2a) MA, MACD**

I'm kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles. Having said that it's obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ATH levels:

[https://imgur.com/QxEygiE](https://imgur.com/QxEygiE) (Barchart Indicators with their buy signals)

Just to note; we're obviously above moving averages at this point: 

[https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj](https://imgur.com/7kKPwvj) 

\-----------------

**2b) RSI, PE Ratio**

It's really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of value-based indicators like the buffet-indicator or the PE ratio. They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:

[https://imgur.com/S86bESi](https://imgur.com/S86bESi)

Without that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;

[https://imgur.com/BtImQgc](https://imgur.com/BtImQgc)

**2b) PE Ratio**

The same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;

[https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5](https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5) (Shiller/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX)

Still ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:

[https://imgur.com/2D415BE](https://imgur.com/2D415BE) (Shiller/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices)

The worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!

It's as if investors don't expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It's not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).

And if the earnings so obviously don't matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)

And lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?

[https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv](https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv) (SPX 21D-RSI on lower chart with BS-boundaries on upper chart)

\----------------

**3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments**

Oh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:

3a) Job Market

&#x200B;

|Date|Actual|Expected|
|:-|:-|:-|
|25-mar|684|730|
|1-apr|719|680|
|7-apr|744|680|

* The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low **2 weeks ago** (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **Last week** we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.
* **This week** we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.

It's weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.

Now that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said ""if we're being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory""... like ... why did you care about them before then?

\-------------

**3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)**

You guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.

This SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we're kind of back with our major growth indices though?

[https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn](https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn) (YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below)

It's not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they're saying that financial corps will do the same next week.

The PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):

[https://imgur.com/vh4TDek](https://imgur.com/vh4TDek) (US PPI Month over Month)

I get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don't see why tech jumped.

\------------

**3c) Risk in the financial sector**

With low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?

We just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn't have to say that about one of our 'national' banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?

\-----------

**3d) Tax revolution**

The current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's ignored??? Someone help me on this please.

\----------

**3e) Vaccination Progress**

At the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.

[https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg](https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg) (Low progress in less wealthy countries)

It seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn't concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.

\-----------

**3f) Chip Shortage**

Major car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.

[https://imgur.com/4diq83G](https://imgur.com/4diq83G)

This is pretty bad news, right? Obviously this means that the market has to go up... like ... I don't understand. This is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up ...

\---------------

There are many other bad news like the Ukraine conflict (where talks about a possible war exist) or the Oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies. Or upcoming (major) bond auctions on monday with the release of the new fed bond buying program pace on wednesday. But I'm leaving it at this right now.

\---------------

Lastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into 'good news' and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4'100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.

\---------------

Ok guys, that's it. I would be happy to have someone explain me why I should be 'bullish' on the SPX. I just loaded up on puts (structured products) after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts.

Thanks to anyone for reading this.

But Im inclined to agree. Its a runaway train scenario: 
if the fed stops buying bonds now inflation will rise in the short term, the market will fall but at the cost of not having long term inflation issues. The rising yields would be seen in the housing market from yield spikes first in less than three months. The other is the fed continues to print money and the treasury continues to spend it into infrastructure, but by increasing the money supply even moreso it would make things worse long term IF and ONLY IF:

Government spending on infrastructure doesnt outpace REAL GDP compared to GDP. (Progress has to outpace inflation)

I understand your point of view and also believe that being bullish on SPY seems unreasonable right now. There is a lot of ""stonks only go up"" and all bad news = prices go up. There are stocks with PE ratio above 1000 or stocks with no revenue like PLTR priced at $23. Fundamentals are detached from the current market and some sort of correction needs to occur to change the sentiment.

The main thing I'm looking forward to is how the tone of the FOMC meeting is this month. Inflation is here, it is apparent. China has admitted to it and trying to battle it. Unemployment rates are faster than we predicted but the dovish stance by JPOW is the same. I wonder if we get the same old tone for this month and the next upcoming months leading to markets continue to be detached and rise or flat. If there is a change to his stance this month, I would expect that to be the catalyst for the stock market since FOMC has so much influence of the stock market.",

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with SBE late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum, + ESG and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

mo8q82,,stocks,post,1618074702,"EXPI: eXp World Holdings, Inc. Question about wording from shareholders meeting vote article.Position: 25@$49 average

Hey, all! Pardon my likely simple question, but I did't know how to google this. Item from the shareholders meeting ballot states:

4. Approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, from 220,000,000 to 900,000,000.

Board Recommendation: **For**

***In the proxy statement, the board states:***

""Although the Company has no current plans to use the additional shares that are proposed to be authorized by the Authorized Shares Amendment, the Board believes that the amendment will benefit the Company and its stockholders by enhancing our ability to consider and respond to opportunities that require the issuance of shares of common stock.""

***Potential effect on stock:***

""If the proposed Authorized Shares Amendment is approved by our stockholders, the additional authorized shares of common stock would have rights identical to our currently outstanding common stock. Future issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, book value per share and the voting interest and power of current stockholders since holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights.""

So, question being: what do you see moving forward adding 680,000,000 shares? Though they may not necessarily release them now, I can't imagine they'll hold on to them forever. I see a potential for a large dilution, and that is a shame. As things stand now, I believe they are significantly undervalued and I would add to my position if I could - they dipped with the tech disaster of March and haven't regained their momentum. However, simply sitting in that number of issued shares is shaking my confidence in their prospectus as a shareholder. What do you think?",['GOOGL']

mnprjw,,stocks,post,1617999585,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 9, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 9, 2021**

Stocks traded higher in another record-setting session in the market. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) both recorded new intraday highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) kept building on recent momentum. Market participants continue to digest remarks from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for “actual progress rather than forecasts” to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, “We’ve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.”

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

mn9n5k,gtx7on2,stocks,comment,1617970711,"Oncologist here. Couple of thoughts.

Important background: They are studying treatment in the *adjuvant* setting (meaning after surgery). These people are typically cured with surgery alone, although recurrences can happen years later, sometime as long as 10 years later. This is also only in women with HER2-positive disease, a targetable protein on cancer cells with many drug targets.

In this study, they took women with node-positive and high risk node-negative, HER2-positive disease to surgery, then treated with their drug + trastuzumab (a standard anti-HER2 drug) vs placebo. They report better disease free survival:

https://i.imgur.com/gYQpclc.jpg

Important to note here that even without their drug, 89% of people did not recur after 5 years.

However, the biggest issue is that this isn’t how we treat node-positive, high risk HER2-positive disease anymore.  We instead prefer treating with *dual* anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab/pertuzumab) before surgery (neoadjuvant), followed by an additional anti-HER2 drug (TDM-1) if there’s anything left at the time of surgery.

Even if you don’t choose to have treatment in the neoadjuvant setting, you would typically combine trastuzumab with chemotherapy after surgery, rather than giving trastuzumab alone.

So I really don’t think these results are interpretable because they didn’t compare with the current standard of care.

Furthermore, there are a ton of anti-HER2 drugs available now, so this is a disease population with a lot of further treatments after recurrence.

What would be more interesting to see would be long-term overall survival in patients who have already progressed on standard trastuzumab/pertuzumab/TDM1. But as it stands, this data presented is very weak.",

mn9n5k,gtwl39i,stocks,comment,1617951467,"Cancer isn't the same thing in every person. Cancer is when one of your cells changes and continues growing abnormally to the detriment of the organism's health. Could be a cell in your breast, prostate, pancreas, brain, bone, intestinal lining, kidney, etc. It's basically a shit lottery for your cells. The good news is that it would take many successive mutations in cells to become malignant as your body constantly removes cells that don't function properly and there are multiple checks cells undergo before dividing. 

This study deals with mainly a type of breast cancer that expresses a certain protein on their cell membranes and activates an immune response. The trial number is 138 participants which might point to potential efficacy but will require tens of thousands of more to corroborate in P3 trials. There are many biotechs developing synthetic antibodies that will target specific cancer cell types but few if none are in contemporary use over chemo or excision. 

I think there is a lot of ignorance and misinformation about what cancer is and how it's treated. Especially with sensationalist headlines like this title.

Even if P3 is cleared the therapy is still years away from mainstream use. Immunotherapy cancer research is nothing new. Buying on this news seems very speculative to me. 

Results of a full-fledged P3 trial with tens of thousands of breast cancer cases with similar results would be much more promising. That would also require years of data too. Don't expect anyone will get an immunotherapy shot that cures their cancer but it could possibly be maintained as a chronic condition within the next decade or two much like how HIV is treated.

Rest assured that any biotech that can develop an efficacious, targeted cancer treatment that utilizes your own immune system to attack and cure cancer would literally be the scientific breakthrough of the 21st century if not on the same level as landing on the moon. 

It would cure a disease that organisms have had since the beginning of time. It would revolutionize cancer treatment and make obsolete all the treatments before it. If/when that happens the company could be worth trillions. I don't think this P2 trial result is that. 

Also, they had their IPO in Sept 2020. If you're sitting on something this big you don't need to go public as private investors/multinational governments would pump cash into you.",

EV/EBITDA currently hovering around 8, while the alcoholic beverage industry for decades has averaged 18-20. Companies like the Sam Adams Company who have pounced on the fast-growing hard seltzer market have seen EV/EBITDAs in the 40s range.

Lots of tailwinds. Reopening of travel, hotels, restaurants, sports, music venues, bars will be a boon to keg sales, as they will need to completely replenish inventory upon reopening (rather than month to month replenishment sales)

mo8sfw,,stocks,post,1618074890,"TQQQ is a fantastic long term investment, even with a volatility of 50+%I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the ""real investors"" want to ignore these statistics.

Every time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.

Instead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. ""Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day"" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. 

This is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.

http://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN

Over 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.

And if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.

Do I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. 

TLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.

Other results for average incomes:
1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return

The stock market tends to have a handful of days of large losses and a lot of days of modest gains, this behavior is ideal for levered products since they compound on the way up day after day (build a spreadsheet model and test for yourself). 

Have a trading plan for TQQQ, don't just buy and forget.  Buy it on dips with a stoploss.  Move your stoplosses up every few months when it rounds out a higher low.  If the market crashes, get back in when $MMTW rebounds and the market has a strong up day on high volume.

We could get into a whole discussion of how the macro environment paved the way for this explosion in tech valuations. The logical next step would be to then discuss what the next decade could look like and why it’s unlikely to resemble 2010-2020.",['NDAQ']

mntmth,,stocks,post,1618012018,"How will Chinese stocks recover?Many Chinese stocks have fallen recently due to fears of delisting, Chinese inflation and anti-trust regulations. The Chinese market is massive so I want to focus on just a few stocks in my questioning. Mainly Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo.

DELISTING- First off, I do not believe a mass delisting will occur, and if it does, it will not delist massive corporations such as those named above and would instead target smaller cap corporations. This is the general sentiment of most analysts as well, as they agree the fear of this is overblown. There is no incentive to delist. Delisted companies could continue to be traded through over-the-counter markets in which massive amounts of money would be missed out on from the Nasdaq and NYSE. Also, if the goal is to delist due to concerns over accurate and ethical information reporting, the delisting of massive corporations such as Nio and Alibaba would be pointless because there is no reason to believe they are misleading investors. The only concern is among smaller cap corporations that definitely should be more moderated. I am not mentioning those within this but I acknowledge their mass delisting could affect all Chinese stocks, even if the concern is misplaced.

INFLATION- Inflation concerns caused a dip today in many Chinese stocks because data showed greater than anticipated inflation through a rise in PPI. The PPI hit 4.4%, the highest mark since 2018 while analysts were predicting 3.6%. For comparison, the US PPI is at 4.2%, the largest annual gain in 9 1/2 years while a jump in 3.8% was expected. Though the rate was higher than anticipated, I agree with analysts that inflation is a temporary concern across the stock market.

ANTI-TRUST- This is the largest concern I have. My main focus is Alibaba which holds >50% of the e-commerce market in China which is expected to grow faster as a sector in China/Asia than in any other market. Alibaba and other e-commerce corporations are being targeted with anti-trust fines and regulations seeking to limit their control over their business partners. Currently they have a policy that makes partners choose one company or another, they could not sell on both JD.com and Alibaba. This policy is under pressure from the government to increase competition. There is also a potential 975 million dollar fine being levied against Baba over similar anti-trust issues.

QUESTIONS-

Do you see Chinese stocks like Alibaba and JD.com recovering soon, if so, how quickly?

Should I be more concerned about inflation in China? I am not concerned about global inflation and American inflation, but the Chinese market could have some alternative impacts from inflation Im not considering.

What is the best play in E-commerce in China if anti-trust laws aimed at Alibaba pass and market share is decreased in the future?

Am I missing any other forces impacting these companies that I should be considering?

Thanks for reading and any feedback would be appreciated and you can definitely disagree. I tried to list my thoughts so you can understand my position on the situation. I just find it crazy calls for Alibaba for 300 expiring in a month are 20$. Is a quick turn around possible or will the price remain depressed?",['NDAQ']

mnzfsu,,stocks,post,1618035557,"Mastech Digital (MHH), value stock in the current marketMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

**FCF CAGR:**  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  **BVPS CAGR** at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  **EPS** is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  **Revenue Growth Rate** is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  **Return on Equity** (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

mnxz6d,gu0p00i,stocks,comment,1618035960,"Not sure how exactly an IPO affects *another company* at least in any direct way, but IPO frequency tends to increase in manic or overenthusiastic markets. Some relative peaks in IPOs since the 90s are 1999 (486), 2000 (429), 2004 (268), 2007 (299), 2014 (258), 2020 (450), and 2021 (387). Note severe pullbacks in the market in 2000-2002 and 2007-2008, and brief cessations of bullish conditions after 2004 and 2014.

All this is to say that the market tends to have a point at which the exuberance ends, and there's a return to reality (downturn) thereafter. But while the market is hyped up, IPOs tend to become more frequent. 

**Why?** Because companies can enter the frenzied market to exchange shares of their company *for capital*. As enthusiasm in the market soars, investors and speculators, old and new, flock to all sorts of securities. As people seek out larger and larger returns, they must often seek out riskier and riskier investment opportunities. Where else better to find these than in a brand new ticker (IPO/SPAC)? What if you buy 1000 shares of some new unheard-of EV company at $10 each and it rockets to $800 in 10 years? It only makes sense that if you want people to buy up your company at high value, then you should wait for the market to be one in which everyone and their mother is throwing money in.

**Can you see how this could be problematic?** While legitimate companies could no doubt enter the market at any time at their discretion, ill-fated, unscrupulous, and/or fraudulent companies can also enter the market *to take advantage of the frenzy*. These companies can rope in willful buyers, ""This EV stock will be worth a fortune in 5 years!"", ""Millionaire investor reveals his pick to overtake Tesla,"" ""Own this solar stock and retire by 2030,"" etc., etc.. These companies might even get pulled into risky funds or ETFs, exposing them to the inevitable downside when such companies are later exposed as unprofitable.

When so many companies become public, they take investible dollars away from other companies.

mmsnc1,,stocks,post,1617891062,"Lumber DD: CNBC and Motley Fool's ""Best Lumber Stocks"" Unsurprisingly Are the Worst Price Performers or Are Unrelated to LumberI had to do this cathartic post because it is hilarious how wrong/clueless the mainstream financial analysts continue to be when discussing how investors could benefit as investors from the historic surge in lumber prices.

**Context for anyone living under a rock the last 6 months**

Lumber has been surging to all-time high prices recently, with every indication that it will continue to climb for the next few months due to how massive the new home construction demand and the busy season just getting started.  The price of dimensional lumber will likely dip at some point but will still stay at 2-3x its normal price into 2022 because of how insane the new housing construction boom.  

For those that have suggested otherwise in recent reddit posts, you’re wrong and this post isn’t about that debate.  Go look at the 2021 and 2022 projections for all of the big home builders (KB, TOL, LEN, DHI, etc…).  Every single one is projected to have record earnings the next two years from increased home construction even with the surge in lumber prices.

**The Financial Click-Bait “Best Lumber Stocks”**

If you’re new to lumber and google lumber stocks to maybe see what options are out there to look into, you no doubt have run into the same laughably annoying phenomenon that I did: the mainstream financial media/internet clickbait sites (like CNBC and Motley Fool) keep on producing the same regurgitated articles titled the “Best ___ Lumber Stocks” or “Best Ways to Play the Lumber Surge” which then offer the same regurgitated hot stock tips: 

1) they recommend stocks that produce exclusively **timber** (like RYN) which get NO BENEFITS from the surge in **lumber** prices *because timber (the logs which lumber is made from) aren’t the commodity whose price is surging 3-fold*; 

2) they recommend stocks that get a large portion of their revenue/enterprise value from things other than lumber (or have such a large stock float) so that the benefits of the lumber surge will be pretty diffuse and not have a proportional impact on their stock price (e.g. WY, a clickbait favorite); or 

3) they pitch stocks like LL, Home Depot and Lowes who have done well riding the home improvement wave, but don’t actually produce their dimensional lumber at all and thus have absolutely nothing to gain from the surge in dimensional lumber prices.

For those who want to invest in this lumber super cycle, it probably would be a good idea to invest in companies *whose earnings are actually tied to the price of lumber.*  Companies like WFG, CFPZF, IFSPF and RFP (This list is not exhaustive; these are just examples).  Companies like these that largely base almost all of their income on dimensional lumber, along with wood pulp and paper for some.  (Note: wood pulp surging to a new high as well, so these guys coincidentally are enjoying a double whammy this year).  And unlike WY, these lumber players don’t have nearly the volume of outstanding shares, so the surge in lumber prices is going to translate in a proportionally larger EPS growth.

If you look at the stock price histories of these lumber companies and compare it to the historical price of lumber, their prices largely track with the changes in lumber (and to some degree wood pulp pricing).  2013 and 2018 had surges in the price of lumber and these companies’ stock prices correlated with those surges.  Why? Because the price of lumber and wood pulp dictate these companies’ earnings.  If you look at the timber companies, like WY and RYN, their stock prices don’t track well to lumber prices because the price of timber is separate.  In fact, despite the epic lumber surge, some timber producers are still not doing well because there is a big glut of it in some areas of the continent.

**Let’s Look at the Numbers**

In the end, it’s the numbers that matter, so let’s look at the price performance of these stocks YTD, the last 6 months and the last year.  CNBC and Motley pitched RYN, WY, LL, HD, and LOW as the best stocks to play the lumber surge.  Let’s see how they have done the last year during this surge compared to the actual lumber companies:

**Shill Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/ihngsVA), [6 Months]( https://imgur.com/a/2LlbPN7), and [1 Year](https://imgur.com/a/GMgb6Ta)

Other than LL, all of them have been doing ok.  Some decent growth, all decently beating the SP.  But nothing spectacular and certainly nothing showing explosive stock price growth correlating with lumber’s explosive growth. (I’ll address outlier LL later.)

Now look at the **Lumber Stocks:** [YTD](https://imgur.com/a/CnYBrAb), [6 Months](https://imgur.com/a/qjTCQRQ), and [1 year](https://imgur.com/a/PAXODpp) 

I included WY to prove a point on how badly CNBC and Motley’s favorite “Best” pick has done compared to the actual lumber stocks.  If you look at their growth, as a group its substantially larger than WY or RYN, or these home improvement store stocks. 

**Take away from the charts:** 

The lumber stocks as a group have so far *destroyed* the shill stocks and actually show the type of growth you’d expect from a historic commodity surge.  Unsurprisingly, these lumber stocks particularly destroyed WY which is the most shilled stock by the financial clickbait media, and is probably why WY then seems to be regurgitated in a lot of the recent reddit posts on Canadian lumber stocks.  

For those correctly pointing out that LL is up 500% in the last year, if you caught that party in Q4, good job.  RFP is still beating than LL by over 200%, but still, great job.  That being said, LL’s surge isn’t because of lumber prices and any future growth again won’t be from the surge in price in dimensional lumber.  And you know that because the price of lumber has surged higher in the last three months, but LL is down ~20% in that same time frame.  Frankly, if you bought LL when CNBC told you to in January 2021, you’d be down 20-25%.  The point being that what propelled LL was not the surge in lumber and it’s future is not likely tied to any sustained lumber surge.

**Forward Looking Comments**

For those cynics who keep saying “Lumber cycle is over.  It’s priced in,” you don’t know what you’re talking about and here’s why.  These Canadian lumber stocks are all sitting roughly around their mid 2018 highs when Lumber surged to $600 MBF for 3 weeks in May 2018, and averaged about $550 MBF during the forestry’s Q2, and then crashed Q3/Q4 2018.  

For comparison, in 2021, lumber has been trading at over $1000 MBF since February, and the May futures just topped $1050 this week. [Here’s the CME futures yesterday.](https://imgur.com/a/TRWdKvE)  January 2022 futures are now closing in on $800 MBF.  It seems pretty clear all of these futures are rising and will continue to due so in the near term.  2021 earnings will likely blow 2018’s out of the water.  Yet despite the fact that these futures show these companies are about the have some of the best back-to-back quarters in industry history, they are still sitting at their 2018 highs... doesn’t sound priced in to me.

Case in point, here’s the basic [valuation ratios for the Lumber Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/fiefWln), and here’s the [valuation ratios for the Shill Stocks](https://imgur.com/a/8jd6SsU).  Despite the epic run these lumber stocks have had this last year, they are largely *still* relatively undervalued and have drastically better forward PE’s when compared to the shill stocks or other related industrial sector averages.  

**Conclusion**

I needed to write this cathartic post because I am sick of seeking these financial “professionals” shill the same mediocre/loser stocks as “the best lumber stocks” which have nothing to do with the production of lumber or are literally the worst price performers in the sector.  

I am not telling you what to buy and can’t predict who will do the best this year.  Each of the lumber stocks have their advantage and disadvantages depending on investor preferences. And who knows, maybe these shill stocks are on the cusp of some epic 1000% gains.  But if you want to find a way to benefit from the lumber surge, then it may be wise to invest in *lumber producers* who actually stand to directly gain from the surge in lumber and still have unrealized value to offer if market conditions stay on their current trajectory.  

If you are unsure if a stock you are looking at is timber or lumber, look at financial statements / website.  You will be able to see in a matter of seconds if their earnings come from timber and real estate or wood products/lumber that are actually surging in value.

Note: I am not a financial adviser.  If there is one take away from this post, **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**  Don’t trust strangers on the internet or TV.  Many of them are either lazy morons who keep regurgitating the same brainless clickbait they read somewhere or they have an ulterior motive and are selling you garbage. I'm long RFP but recognize that all of these lumber stocks will probably do well.","['HD', 'GOOGL', 'DHI', 'LEN', 'WY', 'CME']"

Regarding the fact he personally sold 11% of his holdings from the company think about what you would have done in his case everybody wants his money diversified and he has still 20% of the company equities. secondly regarding the fact the companies games aren't as realistic and sophisticated as others, well it didn't stop them from doubling their revenues each year to 230M$ in 2020 while being mainly only on the US and only on apple (the company has launched itself on android only on 2018). What can we expect about the revenues when they will expend in India and Europe as explained below? What can we expect after a super game with the NFL? What can we expect as the android part of the company is expending three times faster than the apple part? And all this after the company has lost 66% of its value in the last months and the average of analysts expects 80% share price rise within 1 year (see tip ranks)?

On a more personal view games doesn't necessarily have to be very sophisticated to be very addictive and with 40M monthly users with 90% of them from US well it looks like for every twelve americans one is a monthly player. Isn't it sophisticated enough to be virale? The truth is, the platform and the betting part of even these simple games make them very addictive. And don't forget candy crush is the no 1 mobile game of all time, even without betting simplicity can be sometimes the most virale thing.

mohir3,,investing,post,1618104600,"Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s whyWhich is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

mo5ii4,gu1mw1u,investing,comment,1618064549,URNM - it is directly affected by the demand for uranium. It's also been doing consistently well over these last several weird weeks in the market,
mo5ii4,gu1sh4k,investing,comment,1618067465,"Nuclear power in Europe is currently declining, and I would expect it would continue to decline. There are a few nuclear reactors currently under construction in Europe (UK, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia) but they won't replace the reactors that will be closing.

However, nuclear power is growing in Asia, particularly in China and India. China is currently building a number of reactors, with plans to build many more in order to transition away from coal. Globally, nuclear energy accounts for about 10% of the energy mix and the IAEA projects that by 2050, it will account for somewhere between 6-12%.

Keep in mind that the construction of new reactors is very costly and takes a long time. Maybe there is a play there with reactor construction. The shorter term catalyst in the uranium market will be currently operating nuclear plants securing long-term contracts for supply. Prices have been depressed for a decade and continue to be below the global cost of production. Miners were slow to respond, and there was a lot of existing supply in national stockpiles that were being put into the market, but in the last few years production has been tapering off and is below global demand. At some point, power plants will have to step back into the market and sign multi-year deals to secure supply. Its worth noting as well that the cost of uranium is a pretty small part of the price of generating the power, so plants have plenty of room to pay more.

I would stick to ETFs to get broad sector coverage because it's hard to pick winners and losers. URNM was already mentioned, which is a good choice. My money is currently in URA, which is slightly more concentrated with a slightly lower fee. You're a little late to the game as money has already started to move back into the sector, but there still should be a lot of room for growth as demand picks up.

Edit: After reading a lot of the posts that have been made since I first posted, I would just like to add that this is supposed to be an investing subreddit. The OP didn't ask what you or your friends think about nuclear energy. Nor did he ask you to dream about a time when nuclear energy won't be necessary.

Nuclear power is in decline globally, but still accounts for a large part of the global power mix and is growing in some parts of the world. If you think it isn't ethical, then don't invest your money. Do I want to own Cameco stock in 100 years? No. Will I take the 60% I've made off it already, plus the potential upside of another 100% when uranium prices recover? Yes.

If you don't know about nuclear energy or uranium mining, you shouldn't talk about it on an investing sub. In 2 years, my investments in the uranium mining space have returned an average of 100%. I've sold a bit when prices peaked, but I'm still holding most because uranium prices still haven't recovered. Maybe we can start talking about how to make money, instead of whether fusion reactors are the future or whatever.",
modaz8,,investing,post,1618089578,"Assets Have Tanked at Two of the World’s Biggest Short Sellers**Short Selling is a Risky Business.** 

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”","['TSLA', 'TWTR']"

mok1fb,,investing,post,1618114299,"$MHH - Value Stock in this market; my DDMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

mok0m1,,investing,post,1618114213,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",
mok0m1,gu4oqfr,investing,comment,1618128647,I think this is a version of a long-short alpha strategy (or whatever) but the flaw may be that those companies may be expensive to short if the market already thinks they’re losers. Also puts may not be available.,
mok0m1,gu4lzgr,investing,comment,1618125983,I guess identifying the real losers is as hard as identifying the real winners?,
mok0m1,gu4oj0n,investing,comment,1618128442,"1. Your flaws to the strategy is margin call. And on an extreme form, short squeezes. This is exactly what happened to GME and the like. The GME short squeeze was an extreme example in which it only 'peaked' at a 'much lower price' because of liquidity issues from brokerages like Robinhood (or so it claims); in other words, this kind of event if it occurs in our lifetime again would go far higher. Another reference would be Volkswagen short squeeze. On 'retail level', would be Shrekli's KBIO short squeeze in which the stock went up over 10,000% in 5 days. There's also Thai Airways in which in 1 day the price went from $0.16 to $5.95 so a 36x loss; completely unexpected given it all happened without notice.
   1. Markets can stay irrational longer than most can stay solvent. Companies that you think will do poorly will have others too who think alike. And not everyone is a winner.
   2. There's nothing stopping your brokerage from margin calling you cause it needs to collect its shares at the worst possible moment. Especially if your brokerage is worried about the volatility of the stock.
2. Long/Short Hedge Funds. Many of them managed by professionals blow up to some unexpected event in the market. Though to be quite fair, those professionals often leverage to unreasonable means on top.

If you mean puts and all, just note puts have time decay. And when things look 'obvious', the premium of options can be quite high.

&#x200B;

Basically, there's always an edge case of risk that comes with this strategy. In most situations you should come out fine. Just hope you don't live that 'unlucky' experience.

Plus, on 'theory', like the latter post states, a good portion of buyers think the price is good. While the other latter doesn't agree so. So if these bad companies are really 'bad', they should be already valuated as such. Who knows.

Just don't be that unfortunate Tesla bear that keeps losing money shorting and then keeps adding more money on top cause you truly believe you were right. Once you get emotional, it can mean game over. Remember, even if you are right, markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. The stock market can crash while worthless companies can skyrocket in price cause there can be enough people who believe in 'buy the dip' on small/micro cap. That can be a real bloodbath on your returns (hopefully you didn't short because the margin calls then can be unreal at the worst possible moment \[and if you lose your job at same time during this 'recession', oh no\]).",['TSLA']
mok0m1,gu5981c,investing,comment,1618149458,"I've always been curious about this strategy (in my mind I call it the S&P 499). It came to my mind years ago looking at RIG, which brought up the rear of the S&P for years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster (it's now dropped out of the index). Your method of implementing it is easier than having 499 long positions, but it would effectively give you less than 1x leverage, being long and short the same equity. A rules-based Index fund that's long the S&P minus some deliberate exclusions wouldn't have that problem.

Which rules are always part of the fun, but I'd think about something with negative factor exposure: weak profitability, low value, low momentum, high volatility, and I'd also suggest companies with negative past, present and future earnings growth. Amazingly there's usually companies like this in the index. A current example is $LVS, with negative forward and backward earnings growth, deep unprofitability, awful P/B and P/S, and lagging the index over the last year and half-year periods. They're also arguably in a position to be disrupted by internet gambling.

Anyway the fun of this index is its nominally active even though it will strongly mirror the performance of a pure index-based approach.","['SPGI', 'LVS']"

mobt6t,,investing,post,1618084613,"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claimsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it has found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.",

mnvx7u,,investing,post,1618020605,"China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust CaseThe penalty is Beijing’s toughest action to date in its campaign to tighten supervision of the country’s internet Goliaths.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

mopsuv,,investing,post,1618142387,"The bear case for BABA (no news is bad news)The stock is down from ATHs for good reasons due to fundamental changes to the the risk profile of the company, and uncertainties regarding the potential for future success it may have moving forward. 

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

-	Investor sentiment remains unchanged.  No new “buzz-worthy” events are coming up and no recent company news that I see promises to serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest or inflows. 

So what’s changed? Anything?

Are these assumptions correct or did I miss something? What makes BABA an attractive investment to consider now, rather than a wait-and-see story which may or may not see upside in the near- to mid-term? Or should I assume this is a dead money play for the reasons stated above. 


TL:DR 

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent. Down to flat are the trends, so they’ll continue until they have reason not to. Opportunity cost says steer clear.",

mo6q8h,,investing,post,1618068257,"DD on Novartis (NVS), and their role in the treatment of opioid dependence disorderThis is my first DD post, so bear (or bull) with me 

(C+C appreciated, as I had a lot of fun researching and writing this) 

Stock Ticker: NVS

Market: NYSE 

Name: Novartis

Category; Pharmaceuticals

Why investigate this stock? 

With the opioid crisis and its ramifications coming into the media spotlight, there has been an increasing body of research into the use of suboxone for treatment of opioid dependence disorder (ODD). For those of you unfamiliar with suboxone, it is a combination of buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication acts as a partial opioid agonist, and the naloxone component helps prevent abuse. In toxicology and ""Medication Assisted Treatment"" circles, it is becoming favored over methadone due to decreased side effect profile and decreased potential for abuse. Recently, some states have significantly expanded training programs so providers can easily obtain an “X waiver”, which is a qualification required for a medical provider to prescribe suboxone. This suggests that it will be increasingly used in Emergency Departments to initiate ODD treatment, and it will see increasing use in the outpatient clinic setting. 

So why Novartis?

For those of you familiar with Suboxone’s history, it is actually made by the drug company Reckitt Benckiser. However, recently they authorized a generic version which is to be distributed by, you guessed it, Novartis (technically a subsidiary Sandoz, but all traded under the ticker NVS)

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:\~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior).

I’m not saying that generic suboxone is going to be “the next big thing”, however I think it will be mainstay of ODD treatment moving forward in the US given low cost, increasing ease of access, and low(er) side effect profile when compared to other medications for ODD. (Some of you may remember Vivitrol aka long acting Naltrexone, see the head to head vs suboxone here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext))

Now let’s look into some aspects of the stock itself. 

P/E Ratio: \~ 24 

S/p 500 P/E: \~ 34 

I like to look at the P/E ratio as a good starting point to see if the stock is over/under valued compared to its earnings. This can suggest the ability to weather downturns in a market that trends towards over-valuing stocks compared to their real world earnings. 

Next, the relative strength index (RSI). For those of you unfamiliar it is a momentum indicator (I have my own opinions on momentum investing, which I can talk about in a different post). Whether you fall on the side of a value investor or a momentum investor, I think it’s an interesting index to take a look at for any stock, and can help you “time” your purchase. **Remember, there is no end all be all market index.** Regardless, the RSI was developed in 1978 and evaluates price changes to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI is listed from 0-100, with a value < 30 suggesting that a stock is undervalued, and should be bought. A value > 70 suggests a stock is overvalued and should be sold. If you’re interested, take a look into how it is calculated to see why a higher RSI suggests overvalue. 

Anyways, the RSI of Novartis as of this post is 54.4, with a steady trend upwards since February. So what does that suggest? Basically that it is neither overbought or oversold, but has a trend towards being overbought, which doesn’t help us much. . 

Here’s a few good resources to check RSI on stocks you’re interested in: 

[https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab\_name=rsi](https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab_name=rsi)

[https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563)

Looking at the financials of NVS for Q4, they are reassuring. 

See here for financial stats, but they can easily be googled otherwise: 

[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo)

The company demonstrated strong Q4 performance, with increases in Revenue, Net Income, and Profit Margins. However, using the golden rule that **past performance is not indicative of future performance** (except when one takes advantage of specific aspects of momentum investing, again to be discussed in a later post), I would not recommend using financial performance metrics to guide purchases (especially in highly volatile markets), but they do give you a snapshot of the company’s current financial environment. 

Above I’m suggesting that generic suboxone will likely provide a value to the company overtime, as suboxone gains prominence in treatment of ODD. However, what else is NVS up to? 

COVID 19

No covid 19 therapeutics, however Novartis is assisting Pfizer and CureVac in production capacity. Specifically, they will be assisting in filling the vials. I don’t think this will contribute much financially, but it’s good PR, and lets face it good for human kind. 

Current Pharmaceuticals

Novartis is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, so I’m not going to go into an exhaustive list of their products. You can find them on the wikipedia page here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals)

However, many of their drugs have good staying power. Of note, they make Entresto, an Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibitor. For my renal nerds out there take a look at the mechanism, really awesome stuff.. There was a lot of buzz in the medical community about Entresto a few years back. This NEJM trial was huge, showing that the Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibition was superior to Enalapril in reducing risks of death and hospitalization. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor medication which has become a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077)

Digital Health

Novartis recently partnered with Science 37, who has developed an interesting system for virtual clinical trials. COVID 19 was a catalyst for digital health, and I think companies that provide telehealth platforms are going to continue to grow. Many patients love the telehealth option, and often opt for it over an in-person visit for many smaller medical issues/checkups. 

Clinical Trials 

As a large pharmaceutical company, Novartis has a well established clinical pipeline for research. I find that betting on the “next big thing” or breakthrough in therapy is typically a losing bet, especially because you have no idea what the results will be as molecular therapies and typical pharmaceuticals go through the rigorous phases of clinical trials. It is a better to bet on a company that has a lot of experience bringing products to market, with a large research pool to pull from. This article has a great table demonstrating the “success rates” of various drug classes coming to market: 

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:\~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate).

(Spoiler: It’s not good) 

Overall, NVS has demonstrated steady growth, and is a huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. They have a large pool of research and will be responsible for the generic version of Suboxone, which I believe will have a strong role in treatment of ODD moving forward in the opiate crisis. The technicals on NVS are pretty middle of the road, with a reassuring P/E ratio and a dead center RSI. I think it would be a good value investment in the long term, but short term gains may be difficult. 

Finally, what I think is appropriate for the end of all DD posts, is that this isn’t me telling you to buy or sell this stock. Rather, I’ve compiled some information about the company that should be a starting point for your own research and evaluation",['PFE']

The SS has been setting up the past 2 weeks with the initial run over $10.. which allowed the millions of shares held by original pre-merge SP,AC buyers.. to be sold at a break-even price (this was 1st time since merge that prices were back above $10. Now there will be no big levels of resistance when we pass through $10 Monday. The Price held above $9.50 for the first time on Friday & price is right around $10 in AH.

Finviz currently has ATNF as the highest short float on the market 65%. And the total float around 3.5M. Some site have a larger total float.. but all have the short interest to at 2.2M). Additionally there are about 1 Million shares that will need to be bought by MMs Monday as the $10, $12.5, and $15 calls come in the money.

I wouldn’t be shocked if it peaked 50-60 and settled at $35. Just ball-parking..That peak would only be around $1.2B and the $35 settle price- would be around $700M. Which isn’t that high compared to many companies with comparable pipelines. Esp considering- if ATNF had been public during initial phases of the DU trial.. it would have already accreted more of the potential $2.4B value of DU (some for other study’s in later phases like FS). And even at $35.. there is still plenty of room to move up as phase 3 results approach. Additionally, the drop from peak should be less than it usually is- as ppl quickly realize that ATNF has a potentially massive return opportunity across longer time frames).

# C. March Investor Presentation

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016441/ea137987ex99-1\_industrial.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016441/ea137987ex99-1_industrial.htm)

\-A soon to be named auto company is entering a deal with Arbe that will result in 300 million in sales for one model, and could account for 10x (3 billion) in sales for more models.

\-The auto company is likely a US company because it is described as “Western” while the OEM described next to this mystery Western company in the presentation is described as “European”(If it’s a Western and not European, it’s likely a US company) *(\*See investor presentation slide 22)*

\-Elon Musk is quoted in the Arbe investor presentation - “Lidar is doomed” (\*Agree or disagree with Musk feeling this way today, the company is making a point in their presentation about the value of their \~$100 radar on chip IP outperforming the Lidar tech that can costs $1,000’s)

\-Arbe is a “First Mover” and “Market Leader” in 4D imaging radar technology-(Slide 16). This positions them to be chosen first to take the place of traditional radars in the exact same slot that is already built in for radar use, but can now be used for 4D imaging radar chips.

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# What new customer/company fits the description of the largest new deal?

**Customer description #1 -** It is “One of the largest automobile companies in the **world”** *(\*See the Arbe CEO’s merger webcast))*

**Customer description #2 -** It is a “Leading, Global, Western” company\*-(presumably not with a homebase in Europe for reasons described above\*\*\*)\*\* *(\*See Investor presentation slide 22)*

**Company that meets both descriptions** **=** One of the US’s “Big Three” -- **General Motors $GM, Ford $F, or Chrysler/Stellantis $STLA** *\*Although there are no guarantees that it will be one of these 3, there are not many other companies that fit both above descriptions given by Arbe*

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Who is Arbe Robotics / $ITAC and what do they do?

\-$ITAC recently merged with Arbe Robotics to create a publicly traded company

\-Their product is the first and only available long-range, 4D Imaging Radar (so little to no competition)

\-Their 4D Imaging Radar:

\>Is used in personal cars, trucking, delivery, industry, agriculture, mining, etc. \*(Primary / most profitable focus is the automotive industry)

\>Is needed for every level of vehicle autonomy (Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

\>Supposedly outperforms Lidar and Cameras, especially in fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and other poor conditions (see performance details below)

\>Fits in the same slot that current, old radars fit in, but their radar provides over 100x better quality, and a 4th dimension, allowing you to “see” objects in a new way

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Is Arbe’s technology a “disruptor” with a large market opportunity?

1. Qamcom’s CEO explains why Arbe’s technology is a disruptor that supersedes existing alternatives - “Choosing Arbe as a partner was an obvious choice since there is no other radar chipset solution on the market that is comparative,” said Johan Lassing, chief executive officer of Qamcom. “Traditional or contemporary radar solutions don’t solve the challenges that autonomous vehicles face. Arbe revolutionized radar by creating a sensor that provides a never-before-seen image which is close to the image that vision based sensors achieve that also has the properties of radar – Arbe’s 4D Imaging Radar Solution has the potential to be the primary sensor candidate for the sensor suite of any autonomous and semi-autonomous applications and next generation perception platforms.”
2. The CEO says their new 4D Visual Radar technology is designed to fit in the same spot as existing radars, making it immediately usable by auto companies[ ](https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/173-noam-arkind-arbe-robotics/id1353975287?i=1000501753796)
3. The 4D Imaging Radar is suitable for every level of vehicle autonomy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
4. Already has “key partnerships” with Nvidia, Valeo, Denso, and other reputable/large companies involving their radar-on-chip technology (\*See slide 9 of investor presentation)
5. The technology can be used outside of cars - e.g. mines, agriculture, trucking, delivery, more -[ ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/qamcom-will-bring-arbes-4d-imaging-radar-to-trucks-mines-and-farms/)
6. CEO claims their main competitor is Mobileye (\*Mobileye was bought out by Intel for $15 million). CEO claims Mobileye will have a chipset in 2025 that is similar to what Arbe already has today (\*See investor webcast link below)
7. Resolution and performance supersedes all existing radar technology[ ](https://www.embedded.com/imaging-radar-development-platform-offers-2k-resolution/)
8. The Arbe CEO explains their IP value “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""

# Valuation/Profitability considerations

\-Arbe CEO said “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""[ https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc\_src=social-sh&soc\_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&__twitter_impression=true)

\-The Arbe CEO says ""When Mobileye passed $300 million in revenue, the figure that we are expecting for 2025, Intel bought them for $15 billion.”

\-The Spac transaction values Arbe at a low $572 million enterprise value, implying only a 1.8x multiple on 2025 forecasted revenue and a 4.4x multiple on 2025 forecasted pro forma Adjusted EBITDA \*This presumably does not account for new or unexpected deals that may arise of the 10 auto companies they are currently in final stage talks with, or the company referred to as “one of the largest auto companies in the world”

\-ITAC/Arbe has a small, 7.7 million share public float which could move quickly when catalysts are revealed (\*Institutional elements of the non-public float include a PIPE paid for by respected “strong hand” institutional investors such as M&G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures, and Eyal Waldman-(founder and CEO of Mellanox Technologies $MLNX))

\-The institutional portion of the float is unlikely to sell - “What matters is not the price or the valuation at the time of the flotation, but in the long term; especially when the **holdings of all the existing shareholders are vested for at least a year**, so you don't sell in a hurry“[ ](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-has-more-unicorns-than-all-of-europe-1001366171)

\-The CEO recently recommended that shareholders hold shares until they reach a $15 billion dollar market cap-(This is his 3rd company and he believes this company will reach that)(\*This source is described as “Israel's largest and most popular news and content website”) -[ ](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5907598,00.html)

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Summary

Arbe developed and patented a new type of 4D radar imaging technology that negates the need for expensive lidar and vastly improves existing camera/radar performance (over 100x better than existing radar). Arbe is the “first mover” in the market, with little to no competition. The new 4D imaging radar fits in the same slot in a car that the older radar technology uses, making the transition easy for auto companies. The total market for the product includes all Tiers of vehicles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The price was designed to be virtually the same as existing radars-($100 per unit, $150 for premium), and is drastically more affordable than paying $1,000’s for lidar. Arbe’s 4D radar vastly outperforms the more expensive Lidar in many conditions such as fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and more, making it indispensable for both ADAS and autonomous applications.

\*Value will be confirmed by catalyst/deals soon, as the CEO has many quotes describing deals they are signing to be publicized shortly (see above).

mo18p6,gu1m10u,investing,comment,1618064068,"I am in my mid-thirties, been investing since my late twenties in a Roth IRA with Vanguard, doing monthly (now weekly) buys of an appropriate Target Retirement Fund. It's 90% stocks, 10% bonds. 

I feel comfortable with a 100% stocks allocation at this point (still 30 years off from retirement) and am considering exchanging all my Target Retirement shares for VTSAX shares, which will hopefully do better for me in the long run (I would continue my weekly investments in VTSAX for the future).

 I am only nervous because it would be the largest single transaction I've ever made, so I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake!

1. My personal risk appetite aside, is there any reason not to do this?
2. Is there a specific time I should aim to do this? (It seems everything is at a high right now, but does it mean anything?)
3. I'm pretty sure there are no fees associated with an exchange like this. Is that true?

SIDE NOTE: I opened a SEP-IRA so I can contribute some of my small business (sole proprietorship) income to this, since I'll be maxing out my Roth IRA. Should I aim to contribute to a different fund (i.e. not whatever my Roth is contributing to)?

mo18p6,gu202wp,investing,comment,1618071186,"Tax question here. It's surprisingly hard to find this info from googling!

Say I buy $1k of $ABC, it goes up to $10k, and I sell it all. I owe taxes on $9k. Now I turn around and buy $10k of $DEF. It tanks, and I sell at $1k to break even. Do I still owe taxes on the $9k profit? Or do I owe taxes on $6k of that $9k profit (there's a $3k max loss deduction, no)?

Similarly, take the same situation but say I change my mind about selling, and buy back in the next day for the same price and amount of what I sold it for. It then tanks and I sell it for the exact same price and amount as I originally bought in for with that $1k. Do I owe taxes on any of that?

mobmuc,,investing,post,1618084019,"Smith & Nephew (SNN) - Sports injury/hip-replacement play still over 20% discounted from CovidI don't regularly make posts about individual securities...actually this would be my first. I'm tired of daily DD posts on companies that are at ATH, so here's a mini-DD on one that is still heavily discounted from Covid. And of course...this is not investment advice, do your own due diligence.

Let's look at where they made their business in 2020:

- $1.9 billion in revenue in orthopedics: mainly knee implants, hip implants, & trauma devices.

- $1.3 billion in sports medicine

- $1.3 billion in wound management

So we have a company that makes most of their revenue in sports, injuries, and hip/knees. Literally all things that were put on halt due to Covid. As to be expected, 2020 was a terrible year for them, with revenue down 11.2% and EPS down 25%. They also under-performed all their larger peers (i.e. Striker, Zimmer Biomet) whom thanks to more diversified products were not hit as hard.

I believe most of their under-performance is due to events that are transitory:

- Decline in sports injuries due to Covid.

- Postponement of knee/hip surgeries due to Covid.

- Brexit (they are a UK company)

- Inability to effectively run their sales due to Covid & lockdowns.


Let's look at some headwinds that I think the market is not factoring in:

- They have actually increased their R&D budget by nearly 5% during Covid, while most other device companies are tightening.

- The UK is planning to increase corporate taxes to 25% in 2023, however they will have a temporary 130% super-deduction for plant/equipment through March 2023. Meanwhile, UK plans no change to their 13% credit on R&D. I believe SNN, a device manufacturer, will be an out-sized beneficent of this change in tax policy.

- Potential buyout opportunity from one of the larger device makers.

Finally, SNN's debt looks reasonable, and Price/Sales ratio is literally almost at the same spot it was in 2014/2015..a rarity in this market. And their revenue growth has slowly climbed from $3.8 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2019, only falling down to $4.5 billion in 2020. So 2020 was, other than a small drop in 2012, the only year they had a major decline in revenue.

If it's not clear by now I am long SNN. I'm waiting for schools to re-open, sports to come back in full force, and for people to get injured again rather than sit at home in their bubble. It's only a matter of time before people are playing hockey, or recreational soccer.

**Wrestlemania 37** (WWE) is this weekend and returning with a live audience. One of the marquee matches: Big E vs Apollo Crews in a Nigerian Drum Fight. I don't know exactly what a Nigerian Drum Fight is, but I smell $$$ for the sports-injury device company Smith+Nephew.",['ZBH']

It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2.

Note: The multiple is of the price values of the 350DMA not the number of days.

For the past three market cycles, when the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking.

It is also interesting to note that 350 / 111 is 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. In fact, it is the closest we can get to Pi when dividing 350 by another whole number.

It once again demonstrates the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price action over long time frames. Though in this instance it does so with a high degree of accuracy over the past 7 years.

IMO, indicators like these are likely to be only coincidental, although, it’s past accuracy warrants it’s significance. It must be taken into account as well as all previous tops have been blow off tops rather than an Elliott wave ending diagonal (if bitcoin is topping right now). This discrepancy may reduce its accuracy.

However, [my own personal amateur TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/DAn0UXkz-Bitcoin-close-to-Macro-Top/) seems to share a bearish stance. (Note- TA is from early February but trend lines have not been broken so it is still relevant) [Sentiment](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/relative-unrealized-profit--loss/) also seems to be in the ballpark of previous macro tops. 

Having said this, I am only an amateur and i wouldn’t put much stock into my opinion. It is most likely flawed and history has shown it is incredibly hard to predict the pops of bubbles. I could easily see bitcoin exploding to 100k next week. I would not be surprised at all. I am just urging cautiousness, please be sure to set stop losses.",

mn8840,,investing,post,1617937608,"JPMorgan’s Dimon Says ‘This Boom Could Easily Run Into 2023’ - Jamie is the MAN!Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/dimon-says-fintech-and-big-tech-are-here-as-banks-lose-ground)

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

[Read more: Why Fintech Battles Ahead Are About More Than Banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/why-fintech-battles-ahead-are-about-more-than-banks-quicktake)

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",['JPM']

Still, despite this, Naspers for years traded at a substantial discount. Mutual fund FPA Crescent tried a long Naspers short Tencent trade for a long time (just owning Tencent would have been a better idea.) In an attempt to narrow that discount, they spun out the Tencent stake and the other tech investments into Prosus, which (last I looked) still trades at a discount.

Prosus sold 2% and still owns around 28% of Tencent. Also, ""It also promised not to sell any further Tencent shares for at least the next three years."" (https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html)

Futures are mixed this morning. Tech stocks appear to be taking a breather a day after rallying 1%. Nasdaq down about 0.1%. Small caps (Russell 2000) and Dow are up about 0.2%. S&P 500 showing a small gain. That’s as of 0645.

There is one item of interest on the economic calendar today: The Producer Price Index, or PPIs, at 0830. Expectations are for a 0.5% increase in the price of goods sold by manufacturers. A number that overshoots will bring the inevitable concerns about inflation. Bonds are being sold off a bit this morning, probably in anticipation of this. Ten-year yields are up to 1.671%.

mn9mjt,,investing,post,1617942867,"[DD] Bull or Bear: Nano X Imaging (NNOX)General disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

---

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**
---

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

I would have a price target of NNOX at $50 (for the risk adverse) - $100 (if you truly believe).","['GOOGL', 'WAT']"

mn9mjt,gtxbw14,investing,comment,1617973082,">$40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX

This seems extremely expensive in the PACS/RIS space.

edit:
So, for folks who haven't worked in this industry, here's a normal radiology workflow:

1. Your doctor orders a study be done.
1. Scheduling dept creates a work order/appointment in their RIS (radiology information system). This is usually integrated into the HIS (hospital information system) of the Hospital that the DR is affiliated to/has admitting privileges to.
1. Patient shows up for their xray, so they get checked in on the RIS. 
1. Rad tech pulls up the work order on the RIS, preps the patient, and takes photos with the ""modality"" - what people in the industry call things like XRay machines, CT scanners, Ultrasound machines, nuke med machines, and so on. This is basically the ""camera takes photos"" portion. The modality is the camera. They produce photos that can either be printed to film (in the old days) or more likely get digitally transferred into a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System). This company makes cameras, basically. They don't make the photos, they don't make the photo album.
1. The study shows up for the radiologist to read in the PACS. They read it and dictate their findings in the PACS.
1. The dictation shows up in a worklist for a transcriptionist to transcribe into the medical record in the PACS or RIS.
1. The radiologist checks and approves the transcription in the PACS.
1. The study is made available to the requesting doctor with the findings, and the patient gets appropriate treatment.

So out of this entire multistep workflow, this company only seems to make the camera portion. This portion is not usually done as an ""as a service"" since these are huge $6-$8 figure machines, that can require tens of thousands to millions to even get installed. 

Support contracts may be based off of quantity of studies performed, but they're not charging 35% of dang price of every single study. That's absurd. There'd be no incentive to move away from plate + film printing since it would cost more in fees than it would in film doing things ""the old fashioned way"".

That makes me think they're trying to bundle in PACS functionality, but that's absolutely not a good thing. PACS systems are how you store the photos, and retrieve them for viewing, dictating readings, etc.

PACS systems often charge ingestion/storage/viewing fees to access the studies. But even then the pricing is absurd. The PACS system I personally ran charged a few dollars per study, scaling depending on the type (tiny nuke med studies were cheaper than massive mammo studies or gigantic multislice CT scans). XRays are near the low end of the requirements scale. They're just singular pictures, and there's usually only a handful of them. They aren't a ""hot ticket"", which would price them above the competition. 

So, maybe they're relying on the PACS to be *""that good""* - then you've got the issue with PACS/HIS/RIS systems being extremely sticky, and hospitals likely have one already. That means a huge burden to switch.

The medical arena has made it a standard of not having standards. This means any time you attempt to change something, you have to hire specialists called HL7 Programmers to re-implement the gateway systems that translate information between all of these disparate systems and standards. Yes - they made a standard out of the translation system between the standards, rather than implementing a single standard.

The overhead is so massive that many PACS/HIS/RIS vendors will literally give away the modalities and supporting ecosystems to entice customers to switch, figuring they can make it up on support contracts. Modalities like the one this company is making.

There's a massive moat here.

mn2id1,,investing,post,1617918815,"$Hear DD - Brief write-up on a company I think is posed for a good amount of growth in the years to comeHello Everyone,

&#x200B;

We all know that gaming is growing and that it will be a good market to be in for the long term.  According to Grand View Research [The Video Game Market is Projected to grow at 12.9% CAGR from 2020-2027 and the Streaming market will have a CAGR of 20.4% over the same time period](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-gaming-market-size-worth-7-24-billion-by-2027--cagr-48-2-grand-view-research-inc-301220945.html#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Market%20%E2%80%93%20The%20global,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027). also, the [Gaming Headset market is projected to have a 7.5% CAGR from 2020-2026](https://www.wboc.com/story/43596299/gaming-headset-market-2021-is-estimated-to-clock-a-modest-cagr-of-75nbspduring-the-forecast-period-2021-2026-with-top-countries-data)  I am sure that there are other projections which are more than this and that there are others that there are less. However, I would argue even if the numbers are 10% instead of 12.9%, 17% instead of 20.4% and 6% instead of 7.5% that you would want to jump into this industry as it is going to grow at a much faster rate than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

Now a little background on [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)

&#x200B;

Turtle Beach was originally founded in the 1970s and their main goal was making sound software/hardware for musicians. In 2005, however, they decided to use their experience in engineering sound to create headsets for gamers and that has been what they have focused on since.  If you want more info on their history you can go [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Beach_Corporation)

&#x200B;

Now Turtle beach is  known for their gaming headsets - they have nearly half the market share in gaming headsets per their last earnings call [You can see the earnings call transcript here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4411642-turtle-beach-corporation-hear-ceo-juergen-stark-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript) in addition to this, however, they also own [Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/) and [Neat Microphones](https://www.neatmic.com/)

&#x200B;

So now that we have a little background on Turtle beach, I will give you the reasons that I think they are set up perfectly to capture this growing market and to grow in the years to come.

&#x200B;

The Financials:

[Yahoo finance financials for HEAR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HEAR/financials/)

&#x200B;

2 things really stick out for me for Turtle beach when you compare them to the other companies in the industry: 1. their balance sheet and 2. their cost of revenue

If you look at the balance sheet you will see the have an objectively great balance sheet.  $167 in Current assets  - $47 million of which is Cash on hand and $78 Million in Current liabilities - almost all of which is short term payable and accrued expenses. The bottom line is **the company has $47 million in cash and $0 in debt**.  They also have a great gross profit - coming in at about 37% of revenue. which when compared to companies in their industry like Corsair who has a 27% gross profit %.

&#x200B;

Now is where I think people really miss out on Turtle Beach, everyone thinks they are still just a headset company, primarily for consoles - obviously their ticker  doesn't help this image, but they are expanding their foothold into the Computer parts and microphones aggressively.  Per the last earnings call: "" We will continue to expand our PC  gaming portfolio of headsets, keyboards, and mice. The additional  ROCCAT PC products we launched in the fall last year will be followed by  another wave of really exciting new PC gaming products this year. As  I've mentioned, our near-term goal is to create an incremental $100  million business in PC accessories and our longer-term goal is to lead  those PC gaming categories."" How do we know this is really what they are doing and not just simply something said to make investors happy? well if you go to Turtle Beach's website and look at the [Careers Page](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/careers/) you will see that one of the jobs is director of brand marketing - Roccat. This along with the news today that [Roccat just snagged a deal with LCS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turtle-beachs-roccat-pc-brand-123000929.html) tells me they will continue to grow this brand.

In addition to this Turtle beach is still being valued as a gaming headset company.  Look at their PE ratio - it's only 12.19 as of closing today.  Compare that to other players in the sector - Corsair at roughly 27, Logitech at roughly 20 and razer who doesn't turn a profit last I checked.  A PE of 12 for a company with no debt in an industry that will continue to grow is an amazing prospect - however their current valuation makes sense if you think they are simply making headsets which will have moderate growth in the years to come verses PC accessories.

I do want to mention some quick risks to Turtle beach as I think there are some which could very much derail the company:

1. My whole case for Turtle beach depends on them growing Roccat and Neat Microphone - either of these could fail and if that is the case they will have trouble growing at a good pace - compare this to the branding that Corsair, logitech, and Razer already have, and you have a company that should be trading at a lower PE ratio
2. Similar to above, they are a very concentrated company and the majority of their sales do come from headsets, that industry will not grow at an alarmingly fast rate, so that will stifle their growth if it cannot be addressed.
3. While the amount of cash they have for their company size is incredibly good, it is not an amazing amount of cash compared to companies like Logitech, who , if I did my math correctly, [has 1.3 Billion in cash on hand, enough to buyout Turtle Beach at their current market value](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/balance-sheet?p=LOGI).
4. Following the above, In this industry moats are hard to find, while this is a good thing for the growth of Roccat, it is a dangerous thing for the Turtle Beach headsets
5. Finally, due to the company size, one or two poor moves could really derail the company, so that is something to keep in mind.

Overall I am very bullish on the company, this is not my most in depth DD (time has been tight to do a good write up), but I think I brought up most of my bull points.

Positions: Currently 46 @ an Average cost of 25.57.  I will continue to add more shares though throughout the year as I believe this company is undervalued and in a great position to grow.

The end has an excellent explanation for what led to the inflation of the late '70s-'80s.

mn4cq4,,investing,post,1617924396,"Hedging the Hedgefundie (UPRO & TMF)So I've been considering using a significant amount of my portfolio towards implementing Hedgefundie's 55/45 strategy: https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007

&nbsp;

Basically, it is a buy and hold strategy where 3x leveraged S&P 500 UPRO and 3x leveraged 20-year bonds TMF are held 55 to 45 percent, but if we use options to hedge, you could change this allocation to favor UPRO more than TMF (70/30, 75/25, or even 100 UPRO)

&nbsp;

Right off the bat, there's a few concerns with this strategy. First, it is very volatile and depends on the SPY continuing to move steadily up. Many folks are speculating we're in a bubble that is bound to burst somewhat soon. 

&nbsp;

By far the biggest issue with this strategy is that a large drawdown in SPY could absolutely tank UPRO given that it is 3x leveraged. Last March, the fund went from ~$80 to ~$20 in just a couple of weeks, and only reached $80 again in January of this year.

&nbsp;

The inherent hedge of this strategy is in TMF as bonds are often negatively correlated to equities. During the same crash last year, TMF shot up from ~$31 to ~$47, and stayed above $40 for a good portion of the year.

&nbsp;

However, bonds increasing when the SPY decreases isn't a guarantee, so why wouldn't we hedge further by buying some puts on UPRO and TMF ~10% OTM dated a year or so out? This is particularly compelling with Volatility at a low-point at the moment. Puts at this price range for this far out would cost quite a bit, roughly 10% of total investment, but would limit max loss in the event of a major downturn to cost of puts + how far OTM the puts are (20% total).

&nbsp;

Should such a downturn occur, there's a couple things that could happen:

1) UPRO crashes, TMF goes up: in this case the gains from TMF will partially offset the losses in UPRO and you could exercise your put on UPRO and reinvest back in when the market starts to recover.

2) UPRO and TMF both crash: In this case you could exercise the puts and reinvest during the recovery. In the worst case scenario that the market doesn't recover (bear market) you would exercise your puts  and realize a 20% loss from initial investment.

&nbsp;

Given the potential returns of UPRO, it seems likely that it would be capable of generating some impressive returns, particularly if stock market is able to continue the bull-party for the rest of the year. Given the optimism around re-opening and the Fed's dovish monetary policy, this is a definite possibility. And if the market really does break? You could certainly do worse than 20% loss.

I'm sure I'm missing something about this, so before committing to this plan I was hoping to get some opinions. 

Thanks!

EDIT: The major concern I think with this, is the high cost of buying the puts. You would need for UPRO to gain 10% to break even on the puts within the next 288 days (for a Jan 21, 2022 expiration). Of course, this could possibly be mitigated a bit by selling covered calls on UPRO.",['SPGI']

They have a ~3% dividend, and typical issue a 5% stock dividend each year. They have a price to earnings around 6 right now. They’re around the same stock price they were 3 years ago when they were making half as much annually. Finally, my personal favorite, I contacted their investor relations and the CFO emails me back with answers within 24 hours. I love small businesses where people wear multiple hats, and this place must have hired at least *one* guy who likes to work.

Edit: 
1. Thank you for the guy researching the temperory impact of the PPP loan and placing it around 100 Mil in loan growth through the program, referencing that most growth has been non PPP in 2020. This makes sense as there were a lot of restrictions with the PPP (limit on company distributions for instance) making it a less desireable option for business owners if you could get something elsewhere. 

2. Someone brought up an acquisition potentially capping the value of the stock. Funny thing with that is that there are two “Landmark” banks, this one and one on the east coast. On LARK’s investor relations page they have a highlight talking about the investor confusion and how they’re not related/not affected by the acquisition. It was one thing that worried me and caused me to email their investor relations, but fidelity just has a bad newsfeed because the company is so small.",

mminfh,gtroxhn,investing,comment,1617852316,"Interesting and impressive for a micro-cap company.

1. Revenue and profit have been growing for the last 5 years. Even during a pandemic.
2. Free cash flow has been growing for the last 5 years, too. 
3. Net Margin is high, not sure if this is normal for bank industry.
4. Still paying a good % of dividends
5. They're paying down debts while positive in cashflow
6. Equity has been consistently and slowly growing
7. PE ratio at 6.40

Its 5-yr Av. FCF x 15 (conservative number) = **$186M**

And it''s currently being traded at **$124M** marketcap.

I like buying stock based on its free cash flow and this is a strong signal for me that they're undervalued, as long they have a healthy balance sheet.

The only thing that I don't like here is they keep issuing more shares, not crazy but slowly, which is normal for a micro-cap company. However, I stumbled down a post they started buying back their shares last year.

[https://www.reuters.com/companies/LARK.P/key-development](https://www.reuters.com/companies/LARK.P/key-developments)  
*""Landmark Bancorp Board Approves Stock Repurchase Program Of Up To An Aggregate Of 225,890 Shares Of Co""*

Based on its TTM Cashflow statement, they just bought $2,000,000 worth of shares.

I love a stock when they consider buying back their shares, imagine for a micro-cap company, because it's definitely a good sign that they value their shareholders. I love this practice from companies that are publicly traded.

I think I have enough signals to start a <1% position in my portfolio and just watch. I'll be cost-average if they're doing great. I think there's upside potential on this stock and have room to grow from acquisitions but I'm buying from its current cash flow at the moment.

As always, this is not investment advice.

Free cash flow is positive but it’s always worth paying attention to the Balance Sheet when it comes to banks (which is never that straight forward given the varying degrees of regulatory capital required), personally I like to have a decent buffer of Net Book Value v Market Cap as in a liquidation scenario the costs to collect/sell assets are going to eat into this buffer.

mminfh,gtta9d9,investing,comment,1617891696,"At first glance, this looks like a value play based on high level ratios, including P/B, but as they say, there's often more to the story than seems to be the case...

I'm just an average FP&A guy, not a superstar by any means... but what immediately stuck out to me in two seconds of looking at their financials is that the industry's Loan Loss Provision is 2.5 times that of LARK's, and on a micro cap, one small wave of defaults could put this company immediately underwater.

Consider that when BOA acquired Countrywide they discovered that a full third of Countrywide's loans were in default.  Countrywide's acquisition price was 2000 times larger than LARK's market cap.

I've got 20 years of experience in financial and data analytics, and even I don't feel confident in my valuation of banks because once you start getting into Level 2 and Level 3 assets, the valuations are so complicated that even some folks at Goldman couldn't tell you with accuracy what the bank is worth.

I encourage you to think about two things:

1. Have I looked at this company closely enough?
2. Do I understand enough about banking and financial analysis to assess the risks from examining the company's financial record?",

mmnp4v,gtsmylu,investing,comment,1617878980,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That’s as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it’s not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn’t expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week’s 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

That’s all we got today. Don’t worry, next week earnings kick off and things should get more interesting.","['DOW', 'SPGI', 'NDAQ']"

Some highlights: 

[Dimon's discussion of corporate citizenship](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#corporate-citizen)

[Threats from every angle](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#banks-enormous)

>1. Banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system.

>In the chart below, you will see that U.S. banks (and European banks) have become much smaller in size relative to multiple measures, ranging from shadow banks to fintech competitors and to markets in general.

>Whether you look at the chart above over 10 or 20 years, U.S. banks have become much smaller relative to U.S. financial markets and to the size of most of the shadow banks. You can also see the rapid growth of payment and fintech companies and the extraordinary size of Big Tech companies. (As an aside, capital and global systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI) capital rules were supposed to reflect the economy’s increased size and banks’ reduced size within the economy. This simply has not happened in the United States.)

>Some regulators will look at the chart above and point out that risk has been moved out of the banking system, which they wanted and which clearly makes banks safer. That may be true, but there is a flip side – banks are reliable, less-costly and consistent credit providers throughout good times and in bad times, whereas many of the credit providers listed in the chart above are not. More important, transactions made by well-controlled, well-supervised and well-capitalized banks may be less risky to the system than those transactions that are pushed into the shadows.

>2. The growth in shadow and fintech banking calls for level playing field regulation.

>The chart below shows the potential regulatory differences between being a bank and being a nonbank or a fintech company – though this varies for each type of company on each item depending upon its legal and regulatory status. In some cases, these regulatory differences may be completely appropriate, but certainly not in all cases.

>When I make a list like this, I know I will be accused of complaining about bank regulations. But I am simply laying out the facts for our shareholders in trying to assess the competitive landscape going forward.

>It is completely clear that, increasingly, many banking products, such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others, are moving out of the banking system. In addition, lending in many forms – including mortgage, student, leveraged, consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system. Neobanks and nonbanks are gaining share in consumer accounts, which effectively hold cash-like deposits. Payments are also moving out of the banking system, in merchant processing and in debit or alternative payment systems.

[Covid-19 and the economy](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#covid-19)

>1. Bold action by the Fed and the U.S. government effectively reversed financial panic.

>The Federal Reserve (critically, with the support of the U.S. Treasury) immediately rolled out facilities that financed Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other securities that effectively reversed the financial panic taking place. A full-blown financial crisis would have made the COVID-19 recession far worse, deeper and longer. Markets reacted extremely positively, and companies, over the next nine months, raised an unprecedented $2 trillion in debt and equity at good prices, dramatically improving their financial condition and balance sheets.

>Congress, importantly, also took immediate action to provide fiscal stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, totaling $2.2 trillion. This largely consisted of stimulus payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment insurance and loans, which could be forgiven, to small businesses. Please see the following sidebar for more detail on the Paycheck Protection Program.

>Suffice it to say while real damage was done, the size and scope of these programs dramatically reversed the deterioration of the economy and unemployment, which hit 14.8% in April 2020 but made steady progress back to 6.7% by the end of the year – though this number underrepresents the damage that was done because of the large deterioration in labor force participation and the potential permanent loss of many small businesses.

[Public Policy. American Exceptionalism, Competitiveness and Leadership: Challenged by China, COVID-19 and Our Own Competence](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm#public-policy)

>Our nation is clearly under a lot of stress and strain from various events: the COVID-19 pandemic, of course, which has taken more American lives than the total lost in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined, resulting in acute economic distress for millions more; the brutal murder of George Floyd and the racial unrest that followed; the divisive 2020 presidential election, culminating in the storming of the Capitol and the attempt to disrupt our democracy; and the seemingly inevitable, but nonetheless alarming and unnerving, rise of China, threatening America’s global preeminence.

>America has faced tough times before – the Civil War, World War I, the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed, and World War II, among others. As recently as the late 1960s and 1970s, we struggled with the loss of the Vietnam War, political and racial injustice, recessions, inflation and the emergence of Japan as an economic power. But in each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors. This time may be different.

>China’s leaders believe that America is in decline. They believe this not only because their country’s sheer size will make them the largest economy on the planet by 2030 but also because they believe their long-term thinking and competent, consistent leadership have outshone America’s in so many ways. The Chinese see an America that is losing ground in technology, infrastructure and education – a nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality – and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals. Unfortunately, recently, there is a lot of truth to this.

mm65gx,gtqacmj,investing,comment,1617827158,"Really interesting passage here from Dimon w.r.t post 2008 banking regulation and it's impact on loans:

> To understand this in more specific terms, look at the chart above that shows, prior to the COVID-19 recession, banks had $13 trillion in deposits and only $10 trillion in loans. This $3 trillion in “lost” lending (this is, in part, directly related to the new liquidity requirements) may very well have contributed to the secular stagnation experienced in the last decade. If $3 trillion more had been lent, the banking sector would have fostered a more dynamic economy, and GDP growth over the past decade would almost certainly have been faster. 

I haven't heard this brought up before but it's something worth considering.

Also regarding QE and deficit spending:

> If you aren’t convinced yet – consider how surprising it is that $3.4 trillion of quantitative easing (QE) and deficit spending averaging 5% of GDP over the 10-year period after the Great Recession did not result in higher GDP growth and possibly higher inflation. As a reference point, in the mid-1970s, there was no QE – and deficit spending hit 4%, which many people thought was the main reason for the overheated economy and inflation, which, at its peak, was over 12%.

> And so why did all this QE not have the effect you would have thought? QE was never effectively tried prior to the Great Recession, and it is different from fiscal spending. QE is the purchase of securities from security holders who tend to reinvest in the same or similar securities. Clearly, QE reduces interest rates, pushes up asset prices and creates some spending (through the wealth effect). QE, on the one hand, may have some inflationary effects, mostly on asset prices. But on the other hand, it also may have some disinflationary effects – lower interest rates themselves, which is an input cost for businesses, and lower income to savers – which may reduce consumption and may increase the propensity to save (e.g., we may need to set aside more money to protect retirement income). And finally, in this most recent round of QE, much of the money simply made a round trip – because of the new liquidity rules, it ended up back as deposits at the Fed, not as loans.

Just in case anyone needed another explanation of why we aren't seeing massive amounts of inflation. 

In general there's a ton of good stuff in there, the COVID-19 section in particular regarding possible scenarios going forward, risks and some insight into the kind of acute liquidity events that cropped up last year and why we might be seeing them more frequently.",
mm65gx,gtpj41v,investing,comment,1617815487,"I know that coming from Jamie Dimon, who heads one of the largest global banks, calling for increased regulation for fintech sounds pretty self-interested. But I kind of feel like he is right. We've already seen, over and over, what kind of damage banks can do when we leave them to their own devices--and that is with regulation. But an increasing amount of systemic risk is now taking place outside of those regulations.

Take a recent topic of a lot of discussion: Coinbase. As of their December reporting, they had over 90B of customer assets, which would have put them in the top 40 banks. I'm sure their assets have only grown since then, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were top 25 now. But compared a traditional bank, there is almost zero regulation of them.

mm9ppe,,investing,post,1617823242,"Exxon explores sale of elastic polymer business: sourcesBy Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is exploring a sale of its Advanced Elastomer Systems (AES (NYSE:AES)) division, potentially valuing the elastic polymer maker at around $800 million including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

The deal would allow the oil major to nibble at its debt pile, which totaled $45.5 billion at the end of December. Its shares are up around 37% year-to-date on investor expectations that the company will benefit from a recovery in energy prices.

Exxon has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) to solicit interest in AES from potential buyers, including private equity firms, the sources said.

Exxon incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year. It is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.

AES is known for its Santoprene thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), which are elastic polymers used in automotive, industrial and consumer products. The business was launched in 1991 as a limited partnership between ExxonMobil Chemical and Solutia. Exxon became the sole owner of AES in 2002.

The global TPV market is seen growing from $1.6 billion in 2019 and to $2.6 billion in 2027, though the industry has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com.","['XOM', 'AES', 'MS']"

They're establishing themselves to capitalize on the growing fossil fuels market with decreasing competition as rivals divest.

They also have a large footprint in developing nations (see Chad-Cameroon Pipeline) and are expanding into the steady cash flow midstream segment.

Moreover, looking at their research and development, synthetic fuels (AKA efuels), although they likely won't capture much of the ICE market will almost definitely be used for jet fuels and shipping fuels.

mmg62o,,investing,post,1617842616,"$BAOS - Baosheng Media - Recent IPO Play Extremely Undervalued and Primed to Make Moves in 2021**Background:**

Baosheng Media Group is a Chinese Online Marketing solution provider. It's main business model is connecting advertisers to online media. Managing marketing activities, advertising strategies, budgets, and ad optimization services.

**Growth:**

Baosheng Media Group has been steadily growing revenues seeing year over year increases from 2018 to 2019 of 10.5% from $16.16 million to $17.85 million. Securing long term contracts with many media moguls such as: Tiktok, Amazon, Ctrip, 360 finance and Youku.

**Future Growth:**

$BAOS ipo'ed in early February 2021, offering 6 million shares at a IPO price of $5 a share. Raising $30 million in proceeds which will be used for expanding the Company's business scale and building its network of leaders/acquiring employees.

China's digital marketing spending is rapidly growing, with 2021 forecasts expected to increase 20% from 2020. With expected annual growth of above 20% as companies are looking to more short-form video ads and social media ads.

$BAOS is looking to capitalize on this growth by utilizing funds to enter into new sections such as NFT marketing and into the crypto currency field. BAOS received backing and a $10million investment from Ebang $EBON in late March to develop a blockchain-based platform/NFT and crypto currency platform.

BAOS is looking to create a platform to buy and sell NFT related work and enter an exploding market. NFT's market cap grew 1785% from 2020 in early 2021 due to the NFT craze. With China leading the market in dollar volume and spending.

**Margins and Ratios: (competitor valuations)**

BAOS is a market leader when it comes to profitability and margins.

BAOS reported 9.5m and 11.16m in pretax income in 2018 and 2019.

Those are margins of 58.7% and 62.5% respectively for their years.

Return on equity: 43.2% vs market average of 4.78%

Return on assets: 13.27% vs market average of 1.27%

Their bottom line has been steadily improving year over year through developing efficiencies and capitalizing on market trends.

**BAOS:**

Market Cap: 172M

Revenue: 17.8M

Earnings per share of 0.4

Price to earnings of: 14.72

Net profit: 10.8M

Cash on Hand: 51M

**SRAX:**

Market Cap:115M

Earnings per share of (0.69)

Price to earnings: N/A

Revenues: 8.6M

Net Loss: (14.6M)

Cash on Hand:9M

**IZEA:**

Market Cap: 270M

Revenue: 18.3M

Earnings per share of (0.248)

Net Loss: (10.2M)

Cash on hand: 33M

**Comparatives;**

As you can see BAOS is deeply undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few small cap marketing companies that are operating at a profit (62.5%) at that aswell. It also has the strongest balance sheet and cash balance among its peers.

**Cash Position:**

BAOS is flush with cash and there is no threat of any share dilutions/offerings. BAOS is sitting on over 51 million in cash. Broken out by 11Million in cash pre IPO, 30Million from IPO proceeds and another 10 million received from EBON.

BAOS is cash flow positive with cash from operations each year in excess of 9M annually, further increasing its cash position.

BAOS will be looking to utilize this cash to grow its business through acquisitions, new infrastructure such as NFT platforms and acquiring talented individuals.

**Public Float:**

Baos has one of the smaller active tradeable floats on the market. The initial offering only issued 6 million shares of BAOS with many of these shares being locked up until August.

The stock is largely unknown with volumes being very scarce. This is causing significant bid/ask spreads upwards of 3-4%. This also means there is very few walls for when this gains momentum.

**China Low Float Recent IPO Trend**

Chinese low float stocks have been getting pumped across the markets lately. Many of which have been recent IPO's due to their share lock up periods further reducing the floats.

Some prime examples include:

$EEIQ running form $3.58 to $35.20 in 2 days

$UTME running from $4 to $107 in 2 days

$WAFU running from $4 to $21 in 2 days.

$BAOS meets all the above criteria, with a small float, small market cap and in a hot sector. NFT/Crypto

**Upcoming Press Releases:**

I am expecting a press release to be issued in the next week or two regarding the demo/roll out of their NFT platform.

BAOS's first press release was issued on March 18th regarding the EBON collaboration and entry into the NFT field. This was the first day the company could release news due to its 40day quiet period after a IPO. EBON stated in early February it was looking to enter the NFT field. I expect the partnership was entered in early to mid February. Meaning a news release on the development of the platform for BAOS should be right around the corner.

NFT press releases have cause stocks to skyrocket, and was the hottest sector in March. With stocks such as TKAT, HOFV, DLPN and WKEY gaining as much as 1000%. These stocks have cooled off but most are still trading at 2.5-5x their pre press release values.

The market has cooled off since March but I do expect a large movement the day the PR comes out due to the thin walls and small public float.

**Summary/Price target**

BAOS is a unknown hidden gem. The cash obtained through IPO and Ebon investment will help it improve/expand its infrastructure and significantly grow the business. BAOS is already experiencing over 10% annual growth and these numbers will explode in 2021 thanks to China's online marketing spending growth of 20% + in 2021 combined with BAOS entering into the NFT market which grew 1785% from 2020. BAOS is sitting on over 51m in cash and there is no risk of share offerings due to its cash flow from operations exceeding 9m a year. BAOS is a market leader when it comes to cost minimization and profit margins, experiencing over 62% margins in 2019. BAOS is unknown to many and is not getting the traction is deserves, the first press release will send this flying thanks to its bid/ask spread and being in the NFT sector. BAOS is undervalued compared to its peers. It is one of the few profitable marketing small cap companies and is sitting on a boat load of cash.

PT Short Term (May): 10$ after the press release relating to the release of its NFT platform. This would make it the similar market cap as IZEA, while BAOS has substantially more cash and is reporting 11m in net income vs Izea's 10M losses.

PT Long Term 2022: $25

I expect revenues to climb 30% + in 2021 thanks to China market growth and entering new NFT fields combined with purchasing/acquiring new infrastructure and talent. BAOS is still being valued as a marketing company (undervalued) and has not capture any of the NFT/Crypto attention.

EDIT: This post is getting some backlash because this subreddit is anti-chinese plays. I am not advocating to toss 100% of your portfolio on this stock. Allocate a small portion and diversify your holdings. This stock is trading at its IPO price and has limited downside thanks to its cash position. Enter with a small portion and set a stop loss to test the waters. This stock is unknown due to the lack of PR's as it just got out of its quiet period. The upcoming PR about its NFT platform will attract new investors and make this rally. Feel free to sell at a gain once it does so or set a stop loss at your initial investment price and ride it out. Dismissing all Chinese investments is a awful investment strategy.

mmivok,,investing,post,1617852005,"New Position: Atlas Air WorldwideMy portfolio has a lot of technology and stocks that have performed well. As some of these stocks get near their all time highs again, I've been cutting down my exposure to some of them because some of them had grown to a large % of my portfolio (a good problem to have). As a result, I've built up some cash and have been looking for cheaper names of beaten down companies outside of technology. One name I came across was Atlas Air, ticker symbol: AAWW. 

\*Not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be an investment recommendation. Just my two cents about a company I found. Everyone should always do their own DD and reach their own conclusions. 

**Company Profile:**

The company operates aircrafts that it leases to a variety of customers. The business is divided up into two main categories: 

ACMI - the company leases out planes to customers either for chartering pasengers or shipping goods. The customer is responsible for expenses like fuel, landing, and other risks. AAWW is responsible for providing the plane, crew, maintenance, and insurance. 

Charter - this segment provides chartered planes to a variety of customers including sports teams, the US military, freight operators, etc. Here, the customer pays AAWW a fixed fee in order to charter passenger or cargo planes. 

**2020 Financial Highlights:**

\-Revenue grew 17% up to $3.2B  
\-Net Income grew to $360M  
\-2020 Gross Margin expanded to 34% from 30% in 2019  
\-Current Assets grew significantly to $1.2B, $845.6M of it in cash  
\-Net Debt decreased from $2.9B in 4Q 2019 to $2.02B in 4Q 2020, leverage ratio dropped from 4.4 in 2019 to 2.1 in 2020.   
\-Over $1B in cash from operations in FY 2020

**Thesis**

The company did not provide guidance for FY 2021, something that doesnt bother me. The pandemic is still pressing and likely will be for most of 2021. I wouldnt put much stock into any 2021 guidance given anyway. 

I really like this name because of its insanely low valuation and due to the continued need for freight operators. Shipping has obviously been tough due to the pandemic and shipping via ocean is challenging due to the high cost and delayed timing. There is a massive shortage of shipping containers and many shippers are looking for alternative sources to get goods shipped. I think a company like Atlas Air could benefit from that in 2021. Even as the pandemic starts to dwindle down (hopefully), there will still be a huge need for shipping and logistics. sure, people will go out and travel, eat in person, etc... but they will still order online and goods will be in high demand. 

The valuation of the company is insanely low right now. But how can a stock go from $23 to $61 in a year and still be highly undervalued? Right now, the company is trading at a Price/Book of .78 and a price/cash flow of 1.83. Notmany high quality names are going to give you those valuations. 

One other thing I like about this name is their cash build up and deleveraging. This company only had about $100M cash on hand as of 12/31/2020 and like most companies, it cut expenses and capex when the pandemic struck due to the desire to keep cash. Well now they are in a great position to use that excess cash to create value for their shareholders. Management did not make any predications about large stock buybacks, dividends, or acquisitions. I think stock buybacks, something I usually oppose, is the right answer here. The stock is trading under book value and it would make sense to buyback stock here. I dont know the industry well enough to know what names could serve as a strategic acquisition for them. 

**Ownership**

One other interesting note is that Amazon is a shareholder, owning less than 5% of the company. Amazon has warrants that it has excercised in the past. Based on what I can see, Amazon could own more than 10% of the company and appoint a Board member, but it has kept its ownership stake under 5%. As of 12/31/2020, AAWW has 27 airplanes leased to Amazon. 

Of the top 5 institutional holdings, 4 have increased their stakes in AAWW (BlackRock, Vanguard, Greenlight Capital, and Donald Smith & Company.)

**Risks**

\-While I think the Amazon deal is a net positive, there is a risk that Amazon could terminate the agreement. Amazon has the right to terminate the agremeent with or without cause with a 180 day notice. Additionally, if Amazon continues to acquire shares through their warrants, it would dilute existing shareholders. 

\-Air Atlas also does a lot of business with the Department of Defense, Air Mobility Command (AMC). Revenue from AMC represented 24% of total revenue in 2019 and 16% in 2020. While the lowering reliance on them is good, 16% is still a large number. Air Atlas and AMC operate in 2 year contracts and requires strong operational performance from AAWW. Changes to their relationship with AMC could harm the company. 

\-Climate change - if steps are taken to curb carbon footprints through additional regulations or taxes, that would be a net negative for AAWW

\-Decrease in air freight. I noted this one earlier, but the risk that air transportation demand decreases is a realistic risk. I dont agree with that and think the problems with shipping via oceans could lead to more business for air freight companies. 

**Final Thoughts:**

This is my first DD post on this form, so I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts (good and bad). 

I like this company and continue to read about it. It is cheap and there are certainly reasons for that, but I think the stock is still undervalued. The main premise of this position is: ""Do you trust management to allocate capital correctly here given their large cash balance."" For me, the answer is yes, but I am mindful of existing relationships that company has with the DoD and Amazon. I have seen plenty of smaller companies get crushed due to existing agreements with larger companies. 

Right now, I own a LEAP call option. The Jan 2022 call option with a strike price of 50. I will be holding for the months to come.","['AMZN', 'BLK']"

I posted this in r/cars, but I am also very interesting in your input on this, having an (admittedly hobby level) interest in both cars and investments through stocks.  Who do you think will be the future winners? Technology wise, we are seeing an increased pace of development, further surged by COVID. How will giants like **VW**, **Daimler**, **GM** and **BMW** fare? The common thread among these are they are all relatively low priced. VW is heading to become the largest EV maker in 2023, Daimler and BMW are making luxury cars competing with Tesla and the Chinese, and GM seem to have plans to retake the American markeds (I am personally skeptical of the latter, but we will see)

**VW** has already gone up 40% this year, € 243 as we speak, and once it passes 325 it will go past a Price/Earnings rate of 10.

How about **Hyundai**? They recently laid down a plan for further EV development, decreasing production cost. It is likely this will mean their profits will increase despite high investments, which is not reflected in today's value.

How about the reigning kings? **Toyota Motor Corporation** are the world's largest in terms of production volume, being okay priced with a P/E rating of 10. Their insistence on hydrogen as a fuel source is certainly very interesting, and it should be noted they actually don't have a single pure EV in their range currently. Will the future development be hydrogen driven?

**BMW** are also currently well run, with a P/E of 8.5. The public seems to gobble them up, despite some ... unconventional and arguably arrogant decisions not taken lightly by the enthusiasts and older fanbase.

**Porsche**, which I admittedly am a bit biased for (still aiming for a 911 at some point), already had a large surge - and I wish I got into the stocks during January. Is it too late though?  According to Chris Harris on a [Top Gear video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTZ9QRTtfQ) posted yesterday, they are set for some very interesting developments, switching over to **synthetic fuels**, and now targeting the Macan crowd, after surging Taycan sales (which I can anecdotally attest to, I see dozens every day here in the EV capital of Norway, Oslo). They also have some of their best, [Frank Walliser](https://presskit.porsche.de/motorsport/en/mediaguide-2017/topic/gt-programs/porsche-gt-team/info/driver/dr-frank-steffen-walliser-porsche-gt-team-wec-gt-2017.html), at their helm, which seems promising.

How about the Chinese? **Dongfeng Motor** and **Saic motors**? They seem cheap, but I am still skeptical of their capabilities and reputation.

Finally here is a compilation of companies, (credit goes to a Norwegian article summarizing this issue). My personal favorites which I am looking to invest into are highlighted in bold.

As 2021 marches on which one of these companies would you place your bets on, personally? Why/why not? How do you think technology development, regulations and stricter rules as well as consumer habits shape the future?

|COMPANY|COUNTRY|P/E RATE|RETURN SO FAR 2021|RETURN 1 YEAR|MARKET VALUE (BILLION USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Toyota Motor Corp**|JPN|10|4 %|39 %|249|

* VW is a solid bet but they're probably riding higher on hype right now so I'm waiting to see if the price settles a bit lower before making a move.

* BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, etc. are luxury brands that aren't going anywhere but also aren't likely to be major movers in the transition. Their value is tied more to their brand than market share so I'm not particularly interested in them right now. Probably safe but not super exciting.

* I picked up shares of Ford because they're a major manufacturer and because of their stake in Rivian. Admittedly they're moving a bit slow on EVs compared to others but their share price is still low compared to others so it's a safer bet to see short term gains.

mm45l7,,investing,post,1617807980,"Drive Shack, the reopening play you never heard of**General Overview:**

Drive Shack is a company that owns and operates golf courses and the restaurants/ bars associated with them. Between the established subsidiaries Drive Shack, and American Golf there are a combined 43 public facilities and 15 private clubs operated by the company.

They also have an un-established new brand called Puttery set to open three new locations in the coming years. Puttery will be a mini golf experience that should attract more diverse interests beyond the typical golfing crowd. In addition to direct ownership, they also offer management services for to other golf courses.

The overwhelming majority of their operations are in California, but they also have sites in North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, New York, and Texas.

**Financial Overview:**

*Preemptive TLDR: Revenue has been increasing and they're trending toward profitability. Although it may be hindered by further expansion.*

During the 2020 year, net cash flow turned positive as operating expenses were cut and acquisitions were put on hold. This lead to a surprise profit of 13 cents per share for the 4th quarter. Total revenue for the quarter despite limited operating capacity was 60.3 million which was the third lowest performing quarter out of the last 15 they've reported.

For those who care to look for themselves you can find financials [here.](https://ir.driveshack.com/financial-information)

**Growth Potential:**

With California set to lift COVID restrictions in mid June, their operations should begin to see normal functions again. In addition their new brand Puttery should now face less hurdles for its debut.

The backlog of events (like wedding receptions for example), the desire to get out of the house, and the return of business related travel and social functions all pose a great opportunity for short term potential. Being both outdoors and easily socially distancing also helps protect the company's potential should there be more lock downs for whatever reason.

**My Holdings**: 150 shares as of right now

**FINAL TLDR:** *The company has a lot of potential for growth. It's worth the effort of looking into them ahead of earnings in early May.*",['IR']

Fidelity Investments, Square Inc. and several other financial firms are forming a new trade group that aims to shape the way bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are regulated.

The Crypto Council for Innovation will lobby policy makers, take up research projects and serve as the burgeoning industry’s voice in championing the economic benefits of digital currencies and related technologies. Crypto investor Paradigm and Coinbase Global Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency exchange, also signed on as initial members of the group.

Still, the market’s future remains far from settled. Advocates have argued that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that supports them have the potential to create jobs and extend financial services to consumers everywhere, at little or no cost. But policy makers and regulators around the world will play a critical role in shaping the path forward.

“Crypto is at a mainstream inflection point,” said Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Paradigm and Coinbase’s former president. “It’s in its very early stages and, much like the internet (once was), it’s very fragile while it’s in that stage.”

The internet emerged as a major force in global commerce in part because of a handful of key policy decisions, including those that legalized data encryption and resolved questions over sales taxes, Mr. Ehrsam said. The nascent cryptocurrency market is sure to face its own crossroads, even if it isn’t yet obvious what they are, he said.

“It’s challenging because policy makers want to balance risk and reward, and even people who spend time in this space would struggle to predict where this will go in the coming decade,” he said. “It was very hard to say where the internet was going to go.”

The council plans to appoint a board that would include representatives with each of the four initial members. In time, Mr. Ehrsam said, the group will add an executive team.

Mr. Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang founded Paradigm three years ago to invest in both cryptocurrencies and the companies that focus on that market.

Fidelity, an investing colossus with nearly $10 trillion in client assets under administration, opened in 2018 a custody business that stores and trades bitcoin for hedge funds and other professional investors. Last month, the Boston firm became the latest money manager to seek regulatory approval to launch an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin.

Square, an electronic-payments company, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet. And the firm’s Cash App consumer-finance platform allows users to buy and sell the digital currency.

Coinbase, founded in 2012, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. The company, which serves 43 million customers in 100 countries, plans to go public later this month.",

>  
>  
**Verified Users of 56 million**  
Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) of 6.1 million  
Assets on Platform of $223 billion, representing 11.3% asset market share

Trading Volume of $335 billion  
**Total Revenue of approximately $1.8 billion**  
**Net Income of approximately $730 million to $800 million**  
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income.)

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Crazy.

Futures are flat as of 0620. Nothing really doing in any major index. Europe and Asia not seeing much action either. This follows a day of small losses for stocks. Bonds are seeing some buying, with the 10-year yield down to 1.65%.

It’s a quiet period on Wall Street that will probably not change until earnings season kicks off for real next week. In the meantime there is ample time for pontification.

Fed meeting minutes will be released at 1400. That’s the major data release for today. There is the potential that something could be unearthed here that will spook markets, especially if it’s a debate about inflation. Probably none of that will matter in the long term. The Fed will raise rates when it is compelled to do so. Regardless of what is said, that decision will likely be a reaction to market activity rather than a shift in the dot plot.

We are supposed to get first quarter earnings from Carnival (NYSE:CCL), the cruise line operator. “Supposed to” because there is some conflicting information on when this company reports. Kind of hard to figure out. But when we do get it, the numbers should shed light on how leisure travel is shaping up. 

Just got a pretty enthusiastic economic call from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Dimon has been right about these things before. He’s not a prognosticator by trade, which is one reason I tend to trust his forecasts more than most.

I need advice and some serious talk.

I am currently sitting on a portfolio of

\- 45% ETF´s  
\- 40% high dividend stocks and reits and such

rest in individual stocks I picked and liked.

I want more growth as I want to reduce the time I need to get to a certain threshold.

I picked the dividend stocks mainly because of the high yield. the lowest yield I get is 4,5%. highest at 13,4%.

I know that

\- those high yields are probably not lasting forever

\- I miss out on growth of the actual securities

but also , ALL dividend securities are green since I bought them.

the lowest being +1,51% (OMF), the highest being 42,88% (OKE).  
the rest is between 8,7% 27,09% green.

what should I do ? sell at green, take the tax hit (which is about 25% of profits where I live -> germany)  
or keep those titles ?

currently I reinvest every dividend payout I get. but those also take a tax hit. so I am missing out on returns and not even benefitting from the full dividend payout...

I am open for all kinds of tips and suggestions.",['OKE']

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% after hitting a record high of 4,086.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14%, or 46 points, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.

""Watch the S&P 500 over the next few days for potential consolidation - that benchmark is now very overbought / extended on the short-term trading charts and is likely to see some profit taking ahead in our opinion,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note. Initial support is touted in the 3975-to-4000 zone, the firm added.

The gloomy update comes just as energy stocks, which had been battered a day earlier, found their footing as optimism over global growth remains steady. Europe, which remains in lockdowns, is expected to mount a stronger recovery.

The International Monetary Fund lifted its global growth forecast to 6% in 2021, up from its prior forecast of 5.5%, citing the ongoing progress of the vaccine deployment worldwide. The IMF forecast the euro zone to grow 4.4% in 2021. The faster roll out of vaccines in the U.S. continues to spur the reopening process, with California California Governor Gavin Newsom saying the state will lift most restrictions by June 15.

Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), APA (NASDAQ:APA) and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) were among the leaders in the energy sector, with the the latter up more than 3%. 

Financials, however, failed to participate in the broader rally cyclicals, as the run up in regional banks paused. 

State Street (NYSE:STT), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) were among the laggards with just days to go until the major Wall Street banks kick off the first quarter earnings season in earnest.

""Although we expect near-term volatility as 1Q earnings start on April 14, reflecting weak loan growth, margin pressure, lower mortgage banking revenues and seasonal factors, we remain positive on the bank group,"" Wedbush said.

Technology stocks, were roughly unchanged, with the fab 5 trading mixed, even as falling U.S. bond yields supported investor sentiment on longer-duration growth stocks.  

The U.S. 10-year slipped below 1.7% quote yields after trading in range of 1.67% to 1.72% in recent days. 

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded lower, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was higher.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) struggled to get going after racking up a 6% gain on Monday, as investors digested a bearish note from Roth Capital.

What if the neighborhood turns to shit?? What if you buy at the peak moments of the sellers market and the value of the home drops drastically. Isn't that leverage going to be equally as bad to the downside? If i put down $100,000 for a $500,000 home and the value drops to $400,000 by years end... I lost the entire value of my initial investment in the blink if an eye! 

Am I wrong to be so cautious about leveraging money?",

If you lose your job and can't make your payments, you can request forbearance. If you buy wisely, you can cashflow the property while building equity and gaining appreciation.",
mkzjy4,gtisvs8,investing,comment,1617672980,"I think you're comparing apples to oranges here in a sense. 

First, Real Estate is not a liquid asset like your stocks.  It's something you put into a (likely) minimum 5-10yr time-frame with regards to financial analysis. 

Secondly, you own the entire thing. This is not shares in a company that you have no control over. Your DD on buying a property should be way higher than DD on a stock. You should know the neighborhood and know the risks and be willing to take them.  You should be fiddling with pro-formas constantly to decide if a property works for you. If it doesn't then don't do it.  Also, people forget while there is an advantage to leverage, YOU can decide how much you leverage. If you want to have a 50% leverage to feel safer and have a better cash-flow, then you can. Nothing stops you from doing that. 

RE is a great hedge against inflation. Your cost for money stays static mostly, while inflation goes up and so do your rents and so does the value of your asset. In the same vein you're taking tax breaks on deflation and other expenses. 

Of course your stocks won't call you at 3am on a weeknight letting you know that the water heater has exploded in the garage :) 

Lastly, all your ""what ifs"" apply equally if not more to any stock. What if there's a global pandemic and my airline holdings can't fly anyone. Would you have predicted no one would be watching movies in theaters for 9-12 months? There is inherent risk in any investment, but with RE you're more likely to have a long-term glacial change than rapid fluctuation.",
mkzjy4,gtj8nx5,investing,comment,1617681652,"Lots of mixed advice and things of varying degree.  They’re all true just like stocks.

Interest rates are low.  So loans are cheap.  Right now my choice is paying extra on my 3.25% mortgage or invest with my average return being 11%.  Kind of a no brainer,  I’ve made money the last 12 years NOT paying my mortgage down.

Weird thing about property, one of the only times banks will loan big money to average Joe.  Real estate makes more millionaires then any industry.  It’s because people can get leverage easily.  The house is collateral.  It’s rare a property drops to $0 or even 50% quickly.  But like any investment, requires you to do your homework.

Don’t buy a cheap single family home in a questionable town that’s supports the coal industry in bumblefuck nowhere with multiple fracking sites within a couple miles.  Then act surprised the town is becoming vacant or there is pollution in the ground water.

Do buy a duplex in a town undergoing gentrification.  It sounds like a joke, but look for where new Micro Breweries are going up.  It’s the trendy shit that puts your town on the map.  You use to look for new McDonald’s or similar franchise growth in small town.  Today it’s micro brews and ChikFilA.  Bonus points if you’re handy or have a construction background.

Welcome...  

Let me start off with the overall market and speculation regarding e Sports. 

https://preview.redd.it/41s9l13yngr61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842211b13348dc7e77610a6e39f33047c06b63e6

* [February 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgK9aDsgzl0) Q&amp;A with Ann Hand the CEO at 2:25 - **Great Video to get to know SLGG!**

This graph is a bit simple, but it's clear to see e sports would be lead into the multi-billions. If you're here because you want to read Papa Cohen is going to send us to the moon and you're looking for an exit strategy, then this isn't for you. What we see is E Sports is a mere child in the scheme of things. For you smooth brained apes out there, imagine being able to invest into the coverage of football when people wore leather helmets and baseball players didn't take steroids.   


We can clearly see that SLGG has a market cap of about 156M and the current revenue of E Sports in general is roughy 1.48 Billion in 2020. For sake of argument we can say the 1.48B is strictly revenue and SLGG's cap (not revenue) is around 1/10 that size. So what is to be made of this? We have all witnessed the Gamestop short squeezes and yes, there are parallels... but this investment isn't AMC, BB, GME, or fucking Bed Bath and Beyond. This is a LONG term investment and your entrance point is the most important factor to your returns.  


As provided by [u/brbbins1](https://www.reddit.com/user/brbbins1/) short interest is extremely high. I'll repost his DD here.  


&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5c7pfn1qgr61.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02a6df6d2de3a51a0842765b61cde1f361d748e

...but in regard to short interests and squeezes does this look familiar at all?  


https://preview.redd.it/558olgjnqgr61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a79201ff31ef3d8ca3c42dc7091fb5b760125d

If you're looking me to say that SLGG will moon and this will be another short squeeze meme play.. then you're wrong. Could it 100% gain.. definitely so, but dickheads on this subreddit are far too concerned with SLGG being the next GME to realize it's full potential. In my opinion, SLGG lacks the overall attention and coverage gamestop had to recreate the same squeeze. That isn't to say a similar squeeze couldn't be much more powerful or stronger than GME's, but we are missing the catalysts and buying power to do so. Regardless, as posted before, E Sports is in an infancy stage and basing your investment worth off a squeeze will prove detrimental to not only yourself, but the growth of the brand. Let me remind you that investing into a company via stock is investing into the brand. Forget whatever the fuck Ryan Cohen is doing and if GME just rose 10%. Focus on what SLGG needs to thrust itself into being a household name. Everyone has shopped at a Gamestop... what the fuck is a super league in comparison. Stop comparing. An acquisition by GME would not only stunt SLGG's growth, but it would be very ill timed while Gamestop is filing for shares to be sold and a possible recount to fuck the SEC.  


 Yes, i'm aware that the SEC put out new rules for shorts to be announced within a period much shorter than 30 days as before. The reality is, what make you think these motherfuckers won't play hot potatoes like it's their kid's 5th birthday in order to neglect ownership of shorted shares. What we saw with Gamestop very well might be one of a lifetime and SLGG stock holders need to stop pretending this shit is crypto. You're in this for the long term 1-10 years... or you're playing yourself. Simple as that.  


We will be faced with massive shorts. SLGG could hit $4. Who gives a flying fuck if you understand what you're invested into. By the time big hedge money even gets close to bankrupting this company... the same GME board that you dickride to buy out SLGG will likely step in. I'm not saying we need GME involvement at all. What i'm saying is, SLGG is a low hanging fruit that can't be mentioned  on WSB. We have 1.8k members here compared to 9 million. Meaning, if we had the type of attention these other subreddits got, then popping this 600% squeeze wouldn't be an issue at all.   
Furthermore, the SLGG and GME camps share board members of the same kin. You really think that a company that just burst a short squeeze would let their fellow e sports company crumble under bankruptcy due to shortage? It's obvious they would step in because they're fighting the same battle. This isn't the catalyst we need, though. It is besides the fact.   


We see this with prototype Gamestop locations that are lan centers. We see this with all of the partnerships behind the scenes literally making a conglomerate. If you're too lazy too figure that out and want gains, then sell. Otherwise, be in for a turbulent storm and the ultimate cure to this all is bringing more attention to the overall true value of SLGG. There are plenty other E Sports stocks, but SLGG holds the right ti a patent that can't be replicated or duplicated.   


They hold the rights to in person 3rd person bot viewing of ANY game for display. This means movie theaters, gaming hubs, e sports betting, and might very well conflict what Twitch and Youtube have going on. Stop asking for price predictions. Stop waiting for whales to invest and just fucking HOLD. Buy the dips and lower your cost average if needed (not financial advice), but stop sitting here waiting for someone to save you on your delinquent ass mis-informed gamble. Study the company and push the company if you believe in it. That is the essence of shareholding.",['AMP']

What was I going to say? That she bought a stock that had hardly been over .60 per share in 5 years for over $4? She talked to me a few times about how much it was going up and she was really pleased. I put it on my watch list just to see what it did.

Hey Guys, so this is my second DD on a company so please be nice, let me know what you think. I recently came across this company due to NFTs which was very surprising because I had no idea Playboy was even a public company. It looks like they recently went public through a SPAC merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. I had no idea what the company was about except for what most people know it as, a nude magazine company, so I thought of NFTs on hot girls of course that will sell, since we all know sex sells, look at only fans. And BTW the CEO did confirm they are doing NFTs for sure and is in the midst of working on this business opportunity.

After doing some more DD into the company I found out that it was a sound company and its looking to make a big come back. That is why I want to do a breakdown of the company and its potential. I think they deserve some attention.

Note: I do have shares in the company, and I plan on holding long term.

**Marketing/Branding**

So let’s start with Playboy as a brand. Almost everyone knows the bunny symbol. It is one of the most iconic globally known brands out there. And that is why I think this company will have a very bright future depending on how they market themselves. These are some of the impressive numbers in terms of their outreach. Playboy is ranked in the top 40th on list of world’s most powerful brands by licensing Global. 3 billion of global consumer spending, massive global reach, 1million active digital commerce consumers, over 180+ countries, 97% global un aided brand awareness.

Now looking at their business these are currently the sectors that they involved in. Each of these are multibillion-dollar markets.

1. sexual wellness 388 billion
2. style& apparel 1.9 trillion
3. gaming & lifestyle 1.4 trillion
4. beauty & Grooming 434 billion

This means that they have ALOT more room to grow.

**Lines of business (how do they make their money)**

Their current main focuses are on style & Apparel and sexual wellness. Which offers the greatest growth in terms of sales and business expansion. You can see this clearly in their most current revenue reported for q4 2021.

\- sexual wellness - 139 million in revenue

\- style & apparel - 124.4 million in revenue

\- Gaming & Lifestyle - 16.6 million in revenue

\- Beauty & Grooming - 16.2 million in revenue

But besides the first 2 areas that I’ve mentioned that are also looking to expand into gaming and beauty and grooming. Gaming would be involvement in the gambling industry like opening casinos in China or India, maybe sponsors with online poker companies for promotion. For beauty and groom this would be cosmetic products, which that actually have some already on their website.

Playboy is currently working on expanding and re-establishing their brand presence. They have close to 9 million plus followers on Instagram as well as many influencers and celebrities that is helping to promote their products through collaborations. Examples: Ariana grande, Beyonce, Kylie Jenner, Steve Aoki, Travis Scott, Lizzo.

Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. Here are some of the examples.

\- walmart, CVS pharmacy

\- alibaba, supreme, taobao

check their investor presentation they outline over 20 brands they a collaborating with. [https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/0a30134f-9b1d-4246-9258-43dd25167b4c)

As you can see from their business model they are switching to a more online presence. They acquired YANDY and is in the midst of transforming the playboy platform into an ecommerce destination.

**Expansion and vision**

Playboy has been expanding into other areas of the world as well as trying to bridge the gap between generations. In their most recent investor report they outlined that they will be trying to expand further into the Asian market driving sales into China and India with their new apparels. In terms of new generation penetration Gen Z and millennials has been the focused on their marketing brand, lots of shifting to younger females.

**Financials**

A closer look at their financials you can see that they have been growing quite significantly.

[https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd](https://www.plbygroup.com/static-files/818b2992-0b0b-492b-bbd1-2a95b9b601dd)

As you can see, they outperformed their sales DURING a pandemic. So, you could only imagine in the coming year what they will be able to do. Their performance for 2020 was absolutely smashing. YOY of 89% and fourth quarter revenue up 118%. They actually had to raise their guidance that they will be able to exceed 200 million in sales for 2021 which is amazing. In terms of their balance sheet, you can see that they lost a lot less money in terms of their overall revenue compared to 2019. Their P/S ratio is around 5 which is very comparable to the industry average. Their quick ratio is 7 with a gross margin of %84. (on finwvz)

**Their management team is stunning and set up for success.**

[**https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership**](https://www.plbygroup.com/leadership)

If you do a quick search Glassdoors you can see that their company has received a 4.1 rating which is pretty good for a company that’s growing.

**Other Analyst and Stock Price**

Let’s look at the predictions in price - Analyst prediction seems to be in consensus that this is a growing company and is due for some growth in the price.

Zacks - buy rating

tip ranks - high of $35

**Downsides for the company**

Playboy over the past couple of decades have always been the center of criticism for objectifying woman, and this is what the company will try to tackle. Recently they have made some very significant changes in their business model and their branding, trying to drive gender equality and move away from its history of misogynistic views of women but more towards self-expression/art/fashion.

You can see this in their magazine covers and overall focus for their photographs. Even the New York times did a piece on this in 2019, you can read here. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/business/woke-playboy-millennials.html)

In order to prevail over this, it’s going to come down to the leadership and how they are able to pivot themselves away from the traditional views of Playboy being a misogynistic entity and more of a sexual wellness sand gender expression brand.

Other down sides to the company include lots of competitors. There are many apparel companies like Victoria Secret, Nike and adidas that can compete with Playboy. In the sexual wellness space competitors include Lifestyle and Church & Dwight (they make Trojan). Most sexual awareness brands have a very good grip on their customers in terms of brand loyalty so it will be hard for Playboy to draw them away.

**TLDR**

Pros

\- Good Growth, shown by the revenue and has been putting up impressive growth numbers

\- Lots of room to run for their sales, involved in multi-industries able to capitalize on many different forms of revenue

\- Good Management – very experienced individuals that can get the work done so the company can start making money

\- Brand is well known, lots of sources to market, pretty much markets itself without the company having to spend too much.

\- Involvement in many lines of business (CBD, NFTs, cosmetics)

\- Companies has royalties they can collect

\- Movement away from its history and trying to rebrand towards a different audience, which is young females and empowering them.

\- Growing market which gives more available room for Playboy to expand and gain more business without having to compete for market share

Cons

\- Competition with other large players in each of the spaces that it is involved in

\- Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals – with the whole cancel culture I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women

\- Might be spreading too thin with so many lines of business

Summary: I think this is a good company and has room to run till $35 at least. I think if they keep putting up these revenue numbers, they will likely hit 50 -60 dollars. I honestly think they will reach their target of 300 million ins sales before 2025. Their estimates are very realistic given how fast they are growing and how large of the presence they have in Asia.","['CHD', 'NKE', 'WMT', 'CVS', 'GPS']"

They have really strong brand recognition but unfortunately I don’t see how they are going to turn that into something they can monetize in a meaningful way.,
ml5nfg,gtjulec,investing,comment,1617700769,"Did not know that Playboy was still around.  It appears to be a shadow of its' former self per Wikipedia article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy\_Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Enterprises).    


March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be printed  - now completely digital.  No more glossy centerfolds.

It also appears that the adults now own & run the business, Hugh Hefner died in 2017 and his daughter who ran the company from 1988 to 2009 are no longer an issue.  It is also apparent that most of the losing enterprises from Heff's day have been dropped.

In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises’ had merged with Mountain Crest - a SPAC.  


According to Schwab:     
Canaccord Genuity Initiates PLBY Group at Buy Rating With $28 Price Target

Craig-Hallum raises price target to $35 from $25

Roth Capital raises PLBY Group's Price Target to $26 From $18, Keeps Buy Rating

Also up 19% yesterday and 4% After hours.  

If I were to buy into PLBY would have to see what their Asian operations & casino openings slated for the next 3 years are.  And what the former Asian operations financials were before they closed them down.    


As to their brand/product - to be crass the product is a commodity.   Not sure if it has any cache anymore.  As to hawking other brands: "" Not only are they working with celebrities they are also working with many other fashion brands and ecommerce companies to fully market their products. "".  Every company that can,  works with (pays extortionate rates for) celebrities which is a tried-and true way of doing business.  Also pretty tired method.   If you need a reminder of celebrity abuse and how useless it is: doughy-faced Tom Bosley of Happy Days TV show fame gave a rousing recommendation for a swindlers failed investment scheme. 

*On buying sentiment:*   
PLBY has a former reputation to live down, using celebrities to pitch their brand (at very best neutral rating),  their product is barely distinguishable from other brands,  and ""Poor Brand sentiment for certain individuals \[like 50% of the population - women\] – ..... I can see this being scrutinized for its past and history with objectification of women"" - this could be insurmountable.   


Seeing the Penthouse Magazine in its' heyday and what it is now and comparing it to PLBY is kind of the flightplan I see for PLBY.  Went from being misogynistic and vapid to totally vapid.  


***In total - good OP analysis of the positive points but PLBY has some serious perception drawbacks.***  


Think PLBY is a sell for the immediate future not a buy particularly given the runup yesterday and last night.  PLBY is still in their first year of a shakedown cruise  trying to see what works with todays clients.   More distance will have to be put between the past and what they are currently going to do to make money.  Also only time will tell if their new clients gained during the pandemic are sticky or flaky (Jesus that has unintended under/overtones).  The cache of going to a Playboy mansion is dead.  Celebrity endorsement is a big bucket of who cares.  But in 5 years - with a considerable amount of re-branding, some outstanding PR, and dropping of certain lines of business - they could make a go of it.    


But then again, I could be hopelessly out of date.  PLBY could be a total surprise.  For me, it is a pass since it has ""faddish and transitory"" stamped in big letters all over it.  Rather like cigarette stocks; except cigarette stocks pay a dividend.  Maybe PLBY is more of a day trade or swing trade.  Definitely not a buy and hold for me.  


***To the OP: good analysis of the positive side of PLBY.  Think you could very successfully write their promotional material for them.  Look forward to seeing your next DD analysis.  If this post is any indicator you are good at this.***",['BEN']

**NIO** - Known as the ""Tesla of China"" it moves exactly as Tesla does and is looking to trade in the Open Market for China as well as the US, basically a Baby tesla

**FUNKO** - now hear me out, with their recent acquisition of an NFT, i can easily see Funko moving into more of a crypto and long term growth play with a possibility of being bought out by Disney, they have also grown tremendously in the last couple of months

**Coinbase** - IPOing through a directly listing on April 30th, this is kind of an obvious play. They make a SHIT ton of money and are the King broker in Crypto and the most mainstream with their revenue growing from half a million in 2019 to 1.1 Billion in 2020

**RKT** - The biggest mortgage company in the US, expanding into Canada and looking for a fintech category, they are extremely well positioned to start acquiring other companies and start dipping their toes into other sector of the financial market (car loans, Zillow/Redfin Competitors, etc)

**Roblox** - This is strictly here because they are the amazon of gaming. People are able to make money off of Roblox and that makes it a great growth company, really any company that you can make money off of is suitable for huge growth not to mention their insane money spending crowd of kids

**Disney** - hear me out. Expansion coming for disneyland to build two more parks. Their Disney+ series is only going to get better with more marvel and star wars original content and anyone that is a parent knows how good Disney+ is. Also, once everything opens up they will be making money off theaters + their new movie releases on Disney+ to watch from home. I think they have plenty of growth left.

**Apple** - But apple i already the most valuable company how can they possible be considered a *growth* company at these high valuations. Two words for you ""apple car"" and ""Apple glasses""

**Tesla** - for obvious reasons, self driving, insurance for that self driving, more cars, EV charging expansion, all that good stuff

**RIOT** - literally the only reason this is up here is if you think Bitcoin is going to go higher then so is RIOT. in one year it went from $0.70 to highs of $75.....yup, its trading right now at under $50 i think and can easily hit $100+ as long as BTC keeps moving upwards

mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

On the other hand, many people are betting against Arcimoto's success with 23.59% of the float sold short as of 3/15 according to Yahoo Finance.",['TSLA']

I have a large sum to invest (partly inheritance) ie around 0.5m . I have some experience of investing, but not a lot, and the recent increase in my portfolio means there's now a lot more to lose.

I don't really need the money as income (have other sources), so what I want to do is invest it for long term (30 years or so) and may not touch it before I die, and pass it on. 

I would like to grow it as much as possible, and of course not lose it.

So my thinking is index funds. I have to accept that I am not educated enough in finance, and probably not smart enough to get sufficiently educated, to be able to do successful stock picking, much as I would like to. I also don't trust a third party to manage the money fairly or well (not saying my lack of trust is justified, just that I have it).

So then the question is - which index funds?

Although people often suggest that index investing is a simple activity, I would have thought it matters greatly which index you pick.

So my questions are:

- Should I pick an S&P 500 index, even though the P/E ratio looks very much on the high side?

- Should I pick something like the British FTSE 100, which is thought to be undervalued at the moment? And then maybe come back to S&P 500 later?

- Should I choose an emerging markets ETF?

- Or stay in cash until S&P 500 cools down a bit?


I would certainly want to get more than inflation, and more than bonds would give me. I'm happy to sit through ups and downs, I just feel like the decision I make at this point is going to have long-reaching ramifications on my final portfolio.

It seems that Biden doesn't support full-fledged federal legalization. He seems more interested in federal decriminalization and let the states decide what to do for now. If that is the case, these vertically integrated multistate operators (MSOs) will have get a bigger and bigger market share as time goes on. The sooner federal legalization happens, the sooner they can lose market share to opposition (Canadian companies, big tobacco, etc). But because weed is federally illegal, they can't be listed on the NYSE. Being an OTC stock means less hedge funds and big whales invested in these highly profitable companies. Federal legalization can lead the way for them to up-list. Hopefully seeing a boost. 

So I'm bullish because I don't think we'll see federal legalization in the next year, maybe two. It'll let these companies expand. 

As for Curaleaf, they recently saw their bump because of NY legalizing weed. As well as Green Thumb, Cresco, and many other northeast operators.

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

""This may be surprising for some,but I’m going to try to explain why in my opinion this is an undervalued,and misunderstood company. First you have to understand southern car culture. There isn’t a lot to do in the southern states,and middle america. This results in most people pouring money into their cars as one of their main hobbies. My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth. They are rapidly taking over the aftermarket part market through acquisitions. Including expanding into the aftermarket EV car market. In my opinion this is a low risk - medium to high return trade.""

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['GOOGL', 'NOV']"

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

mijlje,,investing,post,1617367458,"U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

While April 14 is the target date, the timing and other details for the listing could change. 
In an amended S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, Coinbase said that it planned to sell 114.9 million shares in its direct listing.

The company, via the direct listing, could be valued at more than $100 billion.
Coinbase will list on the Nasdaq with the ticker COIN. The company initially announced its intentions to go public in December.
But the company cautioned that recent trading prices in private transactions may have little or no relation to the company's opening public price. The filing didn't indicate a trading date.

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k).

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality. 

Those continuing to back fossil fuels are equivalent to those who invested in horses and buggies in 1904.  //",['DE']

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

We’re selling our home for $600,000 cash in the next few months. We’ll be moving into our rental property temporarily for 1-2 years, while waiting for the housing market to tank, before buying property and building a new home. We want that money to make money over the next couple of years but we also cant risk losing it as we’ll need all of it as the down payment for building our next home.

We are 37yo & 41yo w/2 young kids and live well off of just my husband’s salary. After the sale of our home, the only debt we’ll have is the mortgage on our rental property (that we’ll be moving into) and we’ll walk away w/$250k cash.

disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

mj2qmk,gt9lulr,investing,comment,1617472924,"I'm not an expert by any means, but maybe I can help you examine this in some more detail because on the surface this does look interesting.

Most of my gold mining knowledge (which is not much) comes from my time working as a land surveyor [in Colorado gold country.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B047'33.2%22N+105%C2%B031'33.3%22W/@39.792556,-105.5281017,700m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d39.7925558!4d-105.5259125) All those piles of brown from there all the way south and west beyond Idaho Springs are tailings, and there's still gold up in them there mountains. From what I understand, this stuff is exactly what this company would be targeting for processing, but currently the tailings in CO are just being sat on until gold reaches a threshold price where the owner will then start processing the tailings at a profit. I don't know what that threshold is but it hasn't happened yet and there hasn't been activity here since the early 1980s.

So my questions, and these are intended to dig a little deeper, maybe think about things from a different angle and stress test your bullish hypothesis, I'm not trying to shit on your DD or anything: 

1.  Are they purely a tailings-processing company now or do they also operate traditional mines? Looks like purely tailings now, but you also mentioned looking at surface mining internationally in the future.
2. What are their current reserves? Do they have enough tailings in SA to keep them busy at current levels until 2023? 2025? 2030? Their plan seems to be focused on SA until 2026 so I'm trying to get at the scale of revenue and earnings growth for the next 5 years here. Basically if they stay in SA the jump they saw in 2020 may plateau once they hit full operating capacity until they scale up internationally.
3. Specifically related to gold tailings, are the tailings in South Africa more concentrated? Or is DRD's process more cost-effective than traditional processing and allows them to profitably process tailings at a lower price of gold? If their process is significantly and demonstrably more cost-effective then that could be a big disruptive factor for the company. If it's just that the tailings in SA are better quality, then I'm more skeptical.
4. What was the investment required to build the processing plant? And if they expand internationally, will they have to build plants locally, work with local companies (sort of leasing their process), or ship the tailings to their SA plant?
5. Has processing platinum tailings begun? If so when did it begin or if not when is it expected to begin?
6. If platinum isn't up and running, there's more risk inherent there in that case. What is the difference between gold tailings and platinum tailings? Is it a similar process (using the same methods and chemicals) or is it significantly different? Can we expect similar margins from this as the gold?
7. What's their competition here? What other companies are in the gold/platinum tailings processing space?

I don't expect you'd have all the answers to these questions, but maybe there's some things there to think about.

In short, I'm intrigued. If their processing is indeed more cost-effective than traditional tailings processing, then long term that's potentially a good sign for big growth and big scaling. That would mean a potential disruptive factor within that industry and would provide a good competitive moat/advantage. If the jump is simply related to getting a plant up and running and processing high-quality trailings, then I'd expect the growth to stabilize once platinum is up and running (if it's not already) and they'd be more vulnerable to competition especially once they start trying to scale internationally.",

* ETFs holdings from:
https://stockanalysis.com/etf/VTI/holdings/
* Price and analyst target prices from https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&c=1,2,3,7,9,33,34,59,65,69&t=AAPL
* I also used GOOGLEFINANCE to fetch some of the prices. Seems that stockanalysis, finviz and googlefinance don't always agree which investment product a ticker represents (e.g. TILT) so there can be some data mistakes.
* mostly works for companies listed on US exchanges

I did this for my amusement, it's not investment advice.

For some ETFs that saw a huge dip, e.g. ARKK or ARKW, the computed target was close to the historical maximum, so I wonder how much price bias is there in the target price published by analysts (i.e., analysists try to reason current price, rather than coming up with a proper valuation).

I'm going to track this for a while to see how useful this information is.

Edit 1: I explained here how I computed the table: https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mijk9h/i_computed_the_weighted_average_upside_for_100/gt563uy. tl;dr:  ETF's upside is computed from the allocation weighted upside of the individual stocks comprising the ETF.

Edit 2: I added a few more etfs, and I decided to publish the entire doc here for the transparency sake. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR5HjnlzG0EA6wrGmPGZDl9oISgf8ekECzlHUj4zPBW-z-MUH4-N9dwFjOXvD1qcTA29vEoxYT87Unp/pubhtml

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs). Also it doesn't work with non-US listed stocks (e.g. finviz doesn't have data for the ESPO stocks https://stockanalysis.com/etf/espo/holdings/)","['AAPL', 'ARKK']"

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

>New York Attorney General Letitia James' office says it found that Tether sometimes held no reserves to back its cryptocurrency's dollar peg. It said that, from mid-2017, the company had no access to banking and misled clients about liquidity issues.

>In a 2019 filing, the attorney general's office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether's cash reserves to Bitfinex.

>”Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,"" James said in a statement Tuesday.

>”These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system.""

**What is tether?**

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

**What happens now?**

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

Tether will soon face a quarterly report, filed with the AG, may shed more light on how exactly Tether’s money is invested.

People only use tether because it’s the cheapest option for getting  1 dollar US outside of the US. We don’t need it here for obvious reasons. But if Tether crashed people would move into other stable coins USDC and DAI. But there are other complications with that such as supply.

But efforts are underway to transition to a low-carbon economy and therefore a 2 deg C increase. How much is the investment needed? Around 190 trillion (Edit: 90 trillion) USD by 2030!!

In other words, there are *opportunities* in transition to a green economy, and one that has been enshrined in pledges both by public and private institutions. New energy generation, energy efficiency technology, sustainable practices, increase in carbon price and changing customer demands.

A very obvious one: carbon price. It is expected that carbon price needs to be at around 100 USD/eCO2MT in order to achieve the 2 deg transition. What is the current carbon price now? In Europe (the highest) it is only \~37 EUR! And yet the targeted emission reduction in the next few decades already mandates that there be 7% increase in carbon price per annum!

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

* ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.
* ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.
* HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia
* KRBN: tracks the carbon future price of the European Emission Trading Scheme and that in California. The best performing commodity in 2020, and arguably in the years to come. Unlike other commodities, the fundamental case is quite strong.

I understood that it was a lot, but I figured I’d get a good job and get there one step at a time. 

I recently finished paying off my student debt (50k) four years after college (6 years out now). I lived way below my means to make this happen. Recently, I have gotten into investing and I am very focused on compound interest. I started maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, and also started a brokerage account for additional stocks. I continue to live below my means, and I like it that way. Investing makes me feel fulfilled, like I have a real goal I am working towards. 

When I think about those items mentioned above, I no longer get excited. I see them as mountains of debt. I want to buy a house, but I don’t want to do it in this seller’s market. The other items just seem like unnecessary obstacles to reaching my investment goals. I don’t make enough money to accomplish both. 

Part of me feels sad about giving up on my younger self’s dreams, but it’s just not what I want anymore. This is more of just a rant than me asking for advice. Thank you",

News broke maybe 4 hours ago. MSFT shot up 1% on that news, up more than 2% on the day.

Some highlights from the CNBC article:

>""Microsoft will deliver to the U.S. Army over 120,000 devices based on its HoloLens augmented-reality headset.""  
""The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures.""  
""A group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. “We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,” the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract.""

Thoughts on this news? What do you guys think about some employees opposing the decision? All I know is Microsoft is a monster of a company. Just another reason to continue holding I guess",['MSFT']

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people. The thing with the USD is the inflation is pretty predictable, and prices relatively stay the same throughout the years. But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent.

mi3bt3,,investing,post,1617306304,"Micron Soars On Chip Shortage ""Perfect Storm""In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving
    Believes strength is likely to persist through much of calendar 2021 before potentially subsiding to more normal trends in calendar 2022","['AMAT', 'INTC', 'NVDA', 'WDC']"

mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing, despite being well beyond a reasonable period of growth, having a receding market share, and having shown little/no profit for nearly two decades.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes. While I'm aware SUNW does a few commercial projects, it doesn't make up for the baffling lack of volume, particularly when the profit margins on residential are thicker than commercial.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

> SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m   

Debt and accumulated equity deficit are not the same thing. Debt of a company is the total liabilities. Which in the case of SUNW is only $18M, mostly short term operational debt. Their long term liability is only a few million.  

The -$88m is their total accumulated equity deficit since inception. Not money they owe.  

> SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020. 

This appears to be because they generate most of their revenue from commercial solar projects, not residential installs.  Smaller number of large scale project, which is how they generate almost $40M in revenue from 500 installs.

In general, with a focus on commercial I’m not surprised they took a revenue hit. But they ended 2020 with $39M in the bank. Added another $49M through a stock issue. They don’t have a cash problem.

So, recently I’ve seen an increase in posts that are stating that a market crash is on the horizon.

I’m not very concerned, as there hasn’t been a time where the market has crashed and not recovered.

I know about fears of inflation rising, as well as the market currently being perceived as overvalued.

My question is, where are the signs of an upcoming crash (if any)?

In general, what are the signs to look out for?

**EDIT AND UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your responses. Some comments in this post are quite complex for an investor like me lol, but in general I’ve got the idea that all of these stimulus checks, the unemployment numbers, the overvaluation, the excessive money printing, the sneakiness and deceptiveness, all of it shows that a market crash is on it’s way, but that it’s not something to be very worried about for the immediate future.**

**I’ve seen people’s estimates range from next week to never lol, but what I’ve learnt from this is that it’s not possible to totally predict a crash, although they are indicators and events that suggest one may be nearby, and that it’s good to have a decent cash reserve on hand to buy at lower prices and to average down.**

monz2g,,StockMarket,post,1618133469,"$CHPT DD PlayDESCRIPTION

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

History

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's Electrify America and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with SBE (SPAC) late Feb 2021;

What is the business model of CHPT?

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.


BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Market Cap: ~$7bnShares Float 303mlnInstitutional ownership ~13%2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;TAM $190bnNewly formed entity has no Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents ~$650m.Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with41% Gross Margin.

$CHPT enjoys the largest share of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from AFDC shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving ~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for ~22% of the market pie, L2 ~75% and L1, ~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

Products

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

Software Enables - Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

Challengers

$VLTA (SNPR) Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it.SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).$EVGO(CLII): EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.$BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""$VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

Near Term Catalysts

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

Long Term Catalysts

- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

Miscellaneous

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

MOAT

First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)Network Effect ( ~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

CONCLUSION

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology

Why am I interested in $CHPT?

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum, + ESG and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & ~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

I'm a little flummoxed by the legal side of the CRISPR battle at present so I'm hoping someone on here can shed some light on the situation.

My understanding is that the legal battle for the patent is based on a scientific disagreement over who ""invented"" the use of CRISPR-CAS9 technology for humans. One side demonstrated it's use first in other types of cells, while the other took the logical next step in pushing the tech forward. When I read up on the patent however, it appears to be granting rights to the use of CRISPR on any eukaryotic cell, so I'm really unsure as to why this patent is currently owned by Broad and not the original research team.

In addition to this, since it's looking like Broad (and hence $EDIT) is coming out on top, what are the implications of this for agricultural uses of the technology? As far as I'm aware, EDIT is primarily investing in pharmaceutical based research, but a patent for all eukaryotic usage extends far beyond that. Are they likely to be a solid investment from the agricultural side simply because of the royalties?

with how the economy is right now, everyone is expecting signs of increasing rates of inflation as expected by the fed pumping more and more money into the economy (stimulus checks, etc). because of this, people are more willing to spend their money on products that businesses create, thus leading businesses to make even more money, leading them to create even more products which leads to a positive loop that just keeps on going up. if businesses do good, their stocks generally tend to go up. and since higher inflation rates leads to lower interest rates, the act of borrowing money increases which causes even more money to get spent on products and in stocks.

because of this process, shouldnt higher inflation rates just cause the stock market to continue to go up? why do people say that the stock market will decrease due to higher inflation rates if my above explanation makes sense? i understand that things will generally be more expensive and that the dollar will decrease in value but wouldnt investing in the stock market (say S&P500) generally results in higher returns vs inflation? 

or is just 'some' inflation good and we just have not reached 'astronomical' rates of inflation yet that would be bad for the economy/stocks? if you take a look at the history of interest and inflation rates, we are much more on the lower side vs what we were decades ago?

As we all have seen, everyone wants to ""short squeeze"" a stock. Why not ""bull squeeze"" the stock? I know short shares are limited in availability, but wondering what the outcome may be if one were to pull this off or if it's even possible.  

Mainly because I think it is what the hedgies are doing and need to know their actions of war to be able to win on the battlefield!

Thanks in advance and welcome the communications! Very analytical so any examples and hypothetical numbers are most welcome. Thank you!",
moe5e3,gu386vt,StockMarket,comment,1618094037,"""Bull squeezing"" is basically what shorting is all about, and plenty of people are doing just that. The people who shorted VIAC have had a field day lately and the VIAC bulls (especially Archegos) got wrecked. As Archegos got margin called, they were forced to sell their holdings, further lowering the price.

EDIT: That's not to say Archegos specifically got wrecked by shorters (profit takers played a big role here too), but those who did short earned a lot here.

As for ""everyone"" shorting a stock, it depends on what you mean by everyone. Ultimately if everyone is shorting a stock, noone is shorting. If you want a short a stock, you need someone else willing to buy the stock from you.",['VIAC']

To the question of if their valuation is sustainable... Maybe? Stocks are just expensive right now and will continue to be unless interest rates rise. I happen to believe interest rates should remain low, which would support continued high valuations of stocks including Uber.

However, a question like this would either be called FUD or I’d be considered a shill on the boards that want to talk about them and I’m looking for some serious discussion on the topic.

Right now, we have a scenario where the volume has tanked. I’m lead to believe that is because the majority of stocks, real and synthetic, are bought and held. This leads to volatility that lead shorts to do more damage per short, even if we buy up the shorts like we have been. 

Is it possible a stock with that kind of scenario can get shorted to zero? 

I understand if a mod decides to delete this, but I’m hoping that I can get a discussion in a place that wouldn’t just reject it as FUD.

# **Earning season is about to get underway and that could be a positive catalyst for stocks - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/earning-season-is-about-to-get-underway-and-that-could-be-a-positive-catalyst-for-stocks.html)**
*****
> The earnings reporting season gets underway in the week ahead, and it is expected to be a positive catalyst that could continue to send stocks higher for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 start the week at record highs after a strong rally Friday.
*****
> The coming week is packed with Federal Reserve speakers and important data, including a much anticipated inflation reading Tuesday, when the consumer price index is released. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell kicks off another busy week for Fed appearances with a Sunday evening interview on “60 Minutes.” He also speaks Wednesday at an Economic Club of Washington event.
*****
> Powell, in comments this past week, continued to reinforce that the Fed will keep its easy policies in place for a long time, and that any emergence of inflation should be temporary. But hotter-than-expected producer price inflation data Friday has made the consumer price index release Tuesday all the more important. PPI gained 1%, double the expected increase.
*****
> Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said he expects core CPI to rise 0.2% for March, or 1.5% year-over-year, but headline inflation should rise 0.5% or 2.5% year-over-year. Cummins said March is the beginning of a period where inflation could appear greater, just because of the comparison to low levels last year when the economy was shut down.
*****
> “I think the Fed has already moved ahead of it,” Cummins said. He expects CPI to peak at 3.6% in May but then calm down during the summer.
*****
> The other key piece of data in the coming week is the retail sales report for March, which Cummins said could show a 10% gain. The Dow Jones consensus forecast is for a 5.6% gain, following a 3% decline in February.
*****
> Cummins said March sales should be boosted by the $1,400 stimulus checks sent to individuals, which started reaching bank accounts in mid-March. More of the economy has also been opening up, as more people get vaccinated.
*****
> “The back end of the month should be very strong,” he said. “If you look at auto sales, that was the highest level in four years. It seems like restaurants are getting more crowded, with outdoor seating.”
*****
> # Earnings season
> But it may be the earnings season that is the real tell for the economy.
*****
> “It isn’t what they report,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “For the first time, we are going to hear more and more companies now actually making comments about the future. Are they going to upwardly revise some of their outlooks or are they not? That’s what’s really going to be key about it.”
*****
> The big banks kick off the reporting Wednesday, with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. Bank of America and Citigroup report Thursday. Morgan Stanley reports Friday. PepsiCo and Delta Airlines are also among the first to report.
*****
> “The consensus for the first quarter is earnings are supposed to be up roughly 22%. We have an easy comp from last year. That number could be closer to 30%,” said Brian Rauscher, head of global portfolio strategy at Fundstrat.
*****
> Rauscher said he expects the most earnings beats to be in the cyclical sectors, like consumer discretionary, financials and materials, all sectors that benefit from the reopening economy.
*****
> “I think earnings season is going to be constructive, and it’s going to be good enough to keep the market going higher,” he said.
*****
> Based on estimates and early reports, Refinitiv now expects earnings growth of 25% for the first quarter. Companies have been beating estimates so far at a pace of 81%. Earnings for the financial sector are expected to be up 76%. The consumer discretionary sector was hit hard by shutdowns a year ago, and its earnings are expected to bounce back by 98%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “I think what we’re going to start to see is the operating leverage for these companies is really underappreciated. The earnings are going to start to come back faster than the revenues,” said Rauscher. “Corporate America has really done a good job in the last year of streamlining their operations, their cost structures and everything else. Revenues could come back 50%, and earnings could come back 100%.”
*****
> The major stock market indices were higher in the past week, but small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 losing ground. The Dow rose nearly 2% for the week, ending at a record 33,800, while the S&P 500 gained 2.7% to a record 4,128. The Nasdaq was the leader, gaining 3.1% to 13,900. The Russell was down a half percent at 2,243.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stayed in the mid zone of its recent range. On Friday afternoon, it was at 1.65%, well below its recent high of 1.77%.

> # As Close to a Perfect Year For Equities as You Can Get

> Every day in our Morning Lineup, we provide a technical snapshot of the market looking at various metrics. One chart we show is the relative strength of stocks (S&P 500) versus bonds (US Treasury Long Bond Future) over the trailing 12 months (chart below). Whenever the line is in the green area, it indicates that stocks are outperforming bonds relative to the start date, while readings in the red zone indicate bonds outperforming stocks. What stood out about the chart in this morning's report was the fact that relative to one year ago (4/1 close), stocks have been outperforming bonds every day since. Sure, there have been periods in between where bonds outperformed stocks (falling line), but from a longer-term perspective, it has been about as perfect a year for stocks relative to bonds as you could imagine.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/040721-Bonds-vs-Stocks.png))**

> The chart below shows the performance of both asset classes individually over the last year. If you think the divide between political parties in the US has ripped wider, it has nothing on the growing divide between stocks and bonds. While the S&P 500 is up over 50%, the US Treasury Long Bond Future is down 14%. If we had to bet on which divide will start to narrow sooner, is there anything closer to a sure thing than taking the stock vs bond divide over the Democrat vs Republican divide?

> # Blowout Q1 Harbinger For More Gains

> Well-above average Q1 gains for DJIA and S&P 500 bode well for continued gains in 2021. DJIA’s 2021 Q1 gain of 7.8% is significantly higher than its historical average of 2.0% and the 17th best Q1 gain since 1949. S&P’s 5.8% gain was also substantially higher than its average of 2.1% and the 19th best since 1949. NASDAQ was the laggard up only 2.8% in Q1 this year, which is actually below its average of 4.1% since 1971 and the 28th best since 1971.

> In any event positive Q1 returns have been a harbinger for continued market gains for the year as whole. As you would imagine, subsequent Q2 and Q3 returns during the Worst Six Months are not as strong as Q4 at the outset of the Best Six Months. As you can see in the tables below, Q2 and Q3 post positive average numbers, but returns are lower than Q1 and Q4 and there are more losers.

> Further gains for the year as a whole failed materialized for DJIA in 1956, 1971, 1979, 1981 1987, 2002, 2011 and 2012 with lackluster performance for the remainder of the year in 1976 and 1992. S&P failed to produce additional gains in 1956, 1981 1987, 2000, 2011 and 2015 with weak gains for the rest of 1971, 1986 and 2012. NASDAQ failed to add to Q1 gains in 1974, 1981, 1986, 1987, 2000, 2011, 2012 and 2018 with paltry showings for balance of 1975, 1983, 1988, 2006 and 2015.

> Overall positive returns for Q1 resulted in full-year gains for: DJIA 40 out of the last 42 times with an average gain of 16.4% (median 16.3%); S&P 41 out of 45 times with an average return of 16.4% (median 15.6%), and NASDAQ 28 of 34 with an average gain of 18.9% (median 17.0%).

> # LPL Market Signals: Raising Economic and Market Forecasts…Again

> On the LPL Market Signals podcast, Equity Strategist Jeff Buchbinder and Asset Allocation Strategist Barry Gilbert update forecasts based on how the economy’s recovery from the pandemic, aided by vaccine distribution, massive stimulus, and the desire to return to normal, continues to surpass expectations.

> Strong March jobs report. The US labor market grew the most in seven months in March, as the economy added 916,000 jobs, trouncing the median economists’ estimate for a 660,000 gain (source: Bloomberg). Segments of the labor market most dependent on in-person interaction saw the greatest gains, notably hospitality and leisure. We expect to see bigger job gains in the coming months, potentially over one million per month into the summer, helping to close the gap on the more than eight million jobs still needed to get back to the pre-pandemic peak.

> **Raising U.S. and global economic growth forecasts.** An accelerating vaccine rollout, American’s desire to resume somewhat normal lives, and massive stimulus set the stage for booming growth in the U.S. economy this year. Our 2021 U.S. GDP growth forecast goes from 5—5.5% to 6.25—6.75%. A stronger U.S. growth outlook pushes LPL Research’s expectations for growth in emerging markets and globally higher as well.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.7.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1)**

> **Raising our 2021 S&P 500 earnings estimate.** With more economic growth comes more revenue opportunities for corporate America. Companies have been doing a tremendous job of adapting the pandemic, innovating, and generating efficiencies. We are leaving our year-end fair value target for the S&P 500 Index unchanged at 4,050—4,100 for now in anticipation of lower stock valuations as interest rates rise.

> **Raising our year-end target range for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield.** Stronger economic growth and more stimulus spending may put further upward pressure on yields. We have raised our forecast for the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.25—1.75% to 1.75—2.00%.

> # Global Growth Expectations on the Rise

> Before the pandemic we had begun to warm up to international stocks. Valuations relative to the U.S. markets had become increasingly attractive after a long stretch of outperformance by U.S. stocks compared with those in Europe and Japan. We had also anticipated that a weaker U.S. dollar would enhance international stock returns for U.S.-based investors.

> Then the pandemic hit. Since then we have maintained our preference for U.S. stocks over their developed international counterparts. In 2020 the U.S. market benefited from its heavy concentration in technology, digital media, and e-commerce stocks that are well positioned for the stay-at-home and work-from-home environment. More recently, as the Eurozone has struggled to contain COVID-19, our conviction in our U.S. preference has increased.

> “As the end of the pandemic has come closer into view and value stocks do better in anticipation of a full reopening, the environment should theoretically be better for international stocks,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “But the global dominance of the U.S. market has continued in 2021, in part due to sluggish vaccine distribution in Europe, and LPL Research continues to favor U.S. stocks over those in Europe and Japan.”

> A look at consensus expectations for economic growth around the world supports our preference for the U.S. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, not only is gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. expected to outpace Europe, the UK, Japan, and the broad emerging markets this year, but the U.S. has also seen the biggest increase in consensus expectations for GDP growth year to date—an increase of 1.9 percentage points to near 6% (source Bloomberg). Earlier this week we upgraded our U.S. GDP growth forecasts for 2021 to 6.25%—6.75%, while maintaining our growth forecast for developed international economies at 3.75%—4.25%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-CHart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The reopening of the U.S. economy amid the accelerating pace of vaccine distribution is certainly a big driver of the increase in growth expectations this year. But massive fiscal stimulus—now over $5 trillion—is another key part of the story.

> The chart below illustrates how massive this stimulus is relative to the size of the U.S. economy (about 26%), and also how much larger it has been than the response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009. While U.S. stimulus is comparable in size to Europe’s, U.S. stimulus has included more direct payments and spending, and therefore has been more impactful than stimulus in Europe, which has included more loan guarantees.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.8.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional tactical allocations on the U.S. and underweight developed international equities. We also recommend a modest allocation to emerging market equities, where suitable, to take advantage of a strong economic growth outlook and attractive valuations.

> # A Goldilocks First Quarter Has Bulls Smiling

> Stocks have kicked off the year in a strong fashion, and history shows this may give reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. After a solid—but certainly turbulent—year in 2020, the S&P 500 Index has continued to set new all-time highs in 2021, returning 5.8% in the first quarter.

> “Momentum breeds momentum, but you may not want too much of it,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Hitting singles and doubles has historically been the sweet spot for first quarter returns.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns between 5-10% have been the “Goldilocks” level in the first quarter, with an average return of 12.4% through the rest of the year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/revised-blog.png?ssl=1))**

> Returns through the rest of the year have historically been the worst when the S&P 500 is negative in the first quarter, averaging just 3.1%. However, too much momentum in the first quarter may not be ideal, either. When the S&P 500 has returned more than 10% in the first quarter, returns through the rest of the year have averaged 6.5%.

> 1987 is a year that is often referred to as the year of the “blow-off top,” as the S&P 500 returned over 40% through its peak in August, with over a 20% return in the first quarter alone. This was the only year with a first quarter return greater than 10% that was negative through the rest of the year, but removing 1987 from the data only raises the average to 8.7%, not enough to beat the 5-10% return group.

*****

> # Typical April Trading: Strength from Start to Finish

> Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000. April ranks #2 S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.91% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.30% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is just as strong over the recent 21-year period.

> Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off around the seventh trading day. At which point, there is just a hint of weakness heading into mid-month. Then the market tends to resume its charge higher through month’s end. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest. This year the market is enjoying above average gains so far this April. NASDAQ is strongest, up 4.40% as of yesterday’s close. Russell 2000 is the laggard, up a modest 0.99%.

Revenue of more than the entire year of 2020, is it a sign of things to come or is it the peak? I would argue that more quarters like this will happen in the future even if growth slows down, I mean it can’t keep this pace.

Question: what is the max market cap you would be comfortable investing in for Coinbase on DPO date.

**Background:**

·  Topps has been around for 80 years selling baseball and football cards.

·  Topps has license agreements with MLB, Disney, Marvel, etc. and is currently expanding its digital content and NFT business (currently only 6% of revenue).

·  The owner of Topps and the Chairman of the Topps company will be Michael Eisner, former CEO of Disney.

·  Baseball trading cards and NFTs are booming now (Google it, many articles).

·  Topps also has a thriving candy business (Ring Pop, Bazooka gum) and immaterial e-gift card business.

**The NFT angle (The most important thing here):**

·  $MUDS is one of few public companies that is a legit play on NFTs.  (Think $PLBY, $HOFV, $DLPN)

·  Jason Mudrick, who led the SPAC said “We really underwrote the investment just on the existing business, that's what's so attractive about the opportunity, that you really get the upside of the NFTs for free.”

·  Jason Mudrick made a lot of money off of AMC and GME. That tells me he understands retail excitement and its impact on stock price.

·  Mudrick Capital put 100M into the PIPE, which may be 3-5% of his firm’s assets under management (AUM). This is a great show of confidence.

·  Already launched Godzilla and Garbage Pail Kid NFTs on Wax and said it has a pipeline of NFTs including MLBs to launch in spring of 2020 and 2021. (Expect upcoming PRs)

**Low Risk and High Reward NFT Play:**

·  The SPAC will merge Q3 of 2021. Lot of time but usually good SPACs rise in value before merger.

·  The Net Asset Value (NAV) and the Private Investment in Public Entity (PIPE) is 10.15 and the current stock price is 10.87. Until merger in Q3, the stock price can go below 10.15 but will almost certainly stay near NAV since the redemption value of the stock is 10.15. Floor price is 10.15.

·  Unfortunately, many SPACs sell off after the ticker change due to a variety of reasons. I hope to exit MUDS at 15-20 dollars before merger and let the stock settle before deciding whether to stay long.

**Easy view on Valuation:**

·  MUDDS’s valuation is reasonable. Perhaps due to the weakness in the SPAC market, companies are coming to market at better valuations for investors. \*I really like $FRX and $STIC

·  There is no other public company in the collectibles trading card space. Companies I’ve chosen to compare are SPACs I’ve owned in my personal portfolio.

I was hoping to have a discussion about how someone would go about making the most accurate prediction of how an index might behave on a particular day.  I've noticed that most of my individual stock picks tend to follow the broader index they are part of; Russell 2000 has a poor day, my small cap stocks also do poorly, for example.  


Do you gauge by sentiment, technical analysis, external factors like actions taken by the Fed etc.?  Which factors do you think are most important?  Also, \*who\* is good at this and why are they good at it?  Do you know of anyone who excels at making such predictions?",

If day trading, I like to use the hourly 60 day, and 5 minute 10 day. I trade on SMA crosses, and MACD signals. But that stuff all lags behind, so it's really comes down to trends for the day, ask yourself, 'is the index/stock up or down trend wise'.

Whichever tools you use doesn't matter as much as being consistent with your method. Generally speaking the market will break,retest and either reject or advance to the next level which is easily identified as highs and lows on all the different time frames. If there is a lot of upside room on the chart and price begins with a gap up open this is typically a bullish day, ditto for the downside room and gap down open bearish day. When price is trapped by lots of htf trend lines and nearby highs and lows this is generally a choppy day. Two or three days of directional trading usually unwinds at end of week by reversing direction. You just have to study your chosen index by replaying historical price movement and seeing all this play out and then developing a plan that you can actually trust and believe in while executing its signals flawlessly and without emotion.

mo8vld,,StockMarket,post,1618075167,"EXPI: eXp World Holdings, Inc. Question about wording from shareholders meeting vote article.Position: 25@$49 average

Hey, all! Pardon my likely simple question, but I did't know how to google this. Item from the shareholders meeting ballot states:

4. Approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, from 220,000,000 to 900,000,000.

Board Recommendation: **For**

***In the proxy statement, the board states:***

""Although the Company has no current plans to use the additional shares that are proposed to be authorized by the Authorized Shares Amendment, the Board believes that the amendment will benefit the Company and its stockholders by enhancing our ability to consider and respond to opportunities that require the issuance of shares of common stock.""

***Potential effect on stock:***

""If the proposed Authorized Shares Amendment is approved by our stockholders, the additional authorized shares of common stock would have rights identical to our currently outstanding common stock. Future issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, book value per share and the voting interest and power of current stockholders since holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights.""

So, question being: what do you see moving forward adding 680,000,000 shares? Though they may not necessarily release them now, I can't imagine they'll hold on to them forever. I see a potential for a large dilution, and that is a shame. As things stand now, I believe they are significantly undervalued and I would add to my position if I could - they dipped with the tech disaster of March and haven't regained their momentum. However, simply sitting in that number of issued shares is shaking my confidence in their prospectus as a shareholder. What do you think?",['GOOGL']

Today, my portfolio is exactly the opposite. Down 29.7% minus 40K due to so called price corrections, pumpers and shady trading institutions. 

For the elders here, as long as I don't sell, is this typically behavior and in time no matter how long, will the prices usually return to atleast buying time prices where break even is best case scenario on current heavy bleeders in portfolio?

I have been looking at what gives the best correlation of overall market picture and health as a predictor and how we can hedge or trade accordingly. I have found that steel is a very good indicator. I have noticed here that there always seems to be a direct correlational between a sharp uptick in Steel Production and steel products and then a sharp downturn in the global economy. These all tie up quite strongly. The worrying trend or to keep an eye on is look where we are in March. With all the warning indicators flashing it would be interesting to see if we certainly see a downturn in global markets. We have the Chip Shortage, Violence erupting around the world, Brexit, A possible third wave?

I'd like to know your thoughts.",
mnwx0g,,StockMarket,post,1618024414,"An untrained perspective of GME (There was no ""Tin Foil Hat"" flair or i would have used it)Yup, i said it. That's me. When will the squeeze happen? Here's how i see it.

There are lots of DD and guesses going by. Every day passes another guess that didn't come to fruition. Let's face it. No one really knows. Heck, the super successful wallstreet guys never really know either. They always just find the latest loophole/advantage and exploit it, until everything catches up... 

So that leaves me with my dark place, protected by my foil hat. I cant do DD. I dont have years of time put in, or inside knowledge. I'm just a guy who wanted to play.

6 billion in losses isnt shit to these types. They also have ""Friends"" with 90 billion each. 100's of them. They can call 6 roaches out of the woodwork and squash a few million small traders, no problem. So WTF is going on?

Melvin and Co. Got caught in the shitter when the bell rang, by a bunch of apes. Normally, a quick cover up. Some fuckery. A quick illegal shutdown. Some distraction from the new SEC chair, who gives hannies to melvins friends at the parties, some ""Press"" (lmao) and business as usual.... But.

Some huge voices made some statements of support. Like ""nothing to see here. Just normal predatory behavior."" Coupled with the new ability for the masses to transfer information still somewhat unfettered by Beef Wellington and his friends in Connecticut. (Slowly being lost now)

This ""exposed"" the fuckery. Informed the apes who were joined by some heavy hitters, who pinned the petty tyrants into a corner. Where they remain now.

Here is my hat.
I was staring and waiting while this odd stagnation plays out. I went to the most basic levels of thought. I droned on the bid and ask size, which was sitting at ""1"" for extended periods. Really? On $GME? The biggest, most monumental shockwave to smack face on ass face?

Then i saw it. For every action, a reaction. (Regarding the bid/ask sizes) so i tightened my hat. Surely Melvin and kenny and friends are up to fuckery. They will do it with methods and tools not available to apes. The shit will be covered by the corrupt friends in high places. Apes ""would"" get shit on. Using HF Trading systems and sketchy practices to get out of a jam. Little guy gets the shaft again. Right in front of your lying eyes!

  BUT, there are now predators on the side of the apes. The exposure of the vulnerability caught the attention of Beef Wellington's rivals (Beef always shat on them at the party. A little TOO arrogant for the club) who see the opportunity to take Beef's pie and leave with it.  *and an equal force of methods and tools* are now working against the shorted position. Algorithms set that ""counter"" every move made. Experienced traders try to look at the analytics of a day and say WTF here? Every day... don't worry. THEY know WTF

Uh oh... there is no way out now. Everybody knows it. Who ends up with the pie in the end, is the game...

So, ""when""? There is no set time. Beef will have to start shitting on people OTHER than the little guy now. Small fries will start falling. Bigger and bigger entities. ""Names"" will start to fall. Soon, Beef will shit on the wrong guy, who holds the cards to the explosion and final, inevidable downfall.
THEN, you will see large scale implosions. It will be there for all to see. Can't hide it. Can't fuckery out of it. In the news everyday. Another ""massive"" (not really that massive in the realm) corporation or company or entity goes down. Boom!

This process will be longer too. You won't have to catch a 2 NanoSecond peak on thursday. Just keep a good supply of popcorn, and enjoy.

So in conclusion, that's how i stand and hold with none of the FUD having affect. It WILL happen. I DON'T have to watch for anything. The whole world will be watching.

I'll have my little piece though. Because i won't give it back.

Do you really need to tell everyone that you've done something if it actually happened? How does that play into your strategy whatsoever, as a hedge fund?

IMO, they've done everything they can to hide the short interest, kicking the can down the road in hopes that people will lose interest as they delay the squeeze by whatever means necessary (legal or illegal), and reposition themselves to maintain solvency when the mathematically inevitable happens. 

I'd say that if you haven't bought at least some shares of GME, especially considering the current five day discount is at, that you may have a bit too much hope that the markets and financial systems are not the complete frauds that they time and time again show themselves to be.

mntoy9,,StockMarket,post,1618012236,"OTRK - Extremely undervalued AI powered telehealth stock with 136% revenue growth!Hey everyone,

This DD is all about the AI powered telehealth stock Ontrak Inc. (NASDAQ:OTRK).

Quick Highlights: 11'600 partnerships in 40 states, $33.7B adressable market, 136% y/y revenue growth, market cap of only $0.5B, Revenue 2020 was $82.2m compared to 2017 ($7.7m)

Ontrak (previously named Catasys, changed their name in 2020)  is a leading AI and telehealth enabled, virtualized healthcare company.

The company solves the hidden, high cost problem of untreated behavioral health conditions, improving member  health and reducing medical expense. Chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, COPD, and congestive heart failure, which result in high medical costs are currently being treated by them. This is a HUGE market with lots of potential (adressable market of 33.60 BILLION USD per year)

The company’s programs improve members health and deliver validated cost savings to healthcare payers. These cost savings are on average 52% which makes their service and product extremely interesting for any health providers.

They already have partnerships with over 11'600  health providers in 40 states. Their AI-driven platform is proven to work and is already being used broadly by behavioral health providers.  They focus on actually predicting for which people chronic disease will improve & engages people who aren't getting the necessary care they need. This concept is only making sense and we see that it is working. Their second product called ""Ontrak"" provides healthcare solutions via telehealth or in-person to persons with behavioral conditions. These conditions often result in super high costs, Ontrak is here to reduce them - and has successfully done in the past.

It is estimated that in the post Covid-19 period we'll see a siginifant increase in traumatic stress, unemployment and social isolation. These conditions should result in additional spendings of 100-140 billion USD (JUST for 2020-2021). This is another mid term factor that will be important for the future. Link to the McKinsey study:  [Addressing US behavioral health crisis during COVID-19 | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/a-holistic-approach-to-addressing-the-us-behavioral-health-crisis-in-the-face-of-the-global-covid-19-pandemic)

Important numbers:

Of course I've gone trough the whole 10K and found the following numbers to be important for the firm:

\- Revenue growth from $35m to $82m which is a 136% yoy increase

\- Individuals in treatment went from 108'000 in 2019 to 152'000 in 2020 which is a 41% yoy increase

\- The operating loss went from $20m in 2019 to 14m in 2020 (while spending $8m more in research and development and writing off $12m more in administrative costs)

\- Cash and cash equivalents of $87m - no dilution will be needed

\- FY21 Financial Outlook: Revenue of $100m projected

&#x200B;

Very proven management team that is highly experienced:

Mr. Peizer is known in the industry and has founded several other companies successfully. He even has his own website if you want to learn more about him:  [Home - Terren Peizer](https://terrenpeizer.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/v0b8a6y5e8s61.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=b082a08aa366a34a4837393b68f351e103e1f9ce

Share structure and insider activity:

As you've seen on the picture above: the management team (primarily Mr. Peizer) are together holding more than 60% of the existing shares. This is a sign that they believe in Ontrak and have a bullish outlook. Throughout 2020 there has been nothing but insider buying activity.

Total shares: 17.5mPublic float: 8.3mShares held by insiders: 9.2m

&#x200B;

Sentiment:

Google trends shows us that there has been an increasing activity for OTRK. This publicity is a good thing for the firm.

https://preview.redd.it/k3co6d64f8s61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a3d1b1b787b38a1665cd3d198dd4cbf1c2a49b2

Technical analysis:

OTRK has been steadily growing due to their exceptional financial numbers. In march we've seen a rapid fall in price (I'll get to that) resulting in a big gap that has partially started to get filled. The price fell perfectly onto the fibonacci level.  We've got a bottom trend line, the price is respecting it perfectly and due to that I belive that we'll soon break out of the triangle and start the gap fill. The MACD looks green aswell (just another confirmation). On the 4h chart we have a RSI, CCI and OBVI bullish divergence.

https://preview.redd.it/nefqi45df8s61.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=157978cb8e5b5194ffcab16866c0d8ee9feeeba5

&#x200B;

Now to the rapid fall in 2020. According to the 10K and a press statement they have lost their biggest customer (who then accounted to 58% of the revenue). This happened on february 2021, the stock fell about 70% afterwards. We can't ignore the loss of this customer but realistically they have shown us how great growth numbers Ontrak can deliver. I have no doubt that they will continue to grow like that in the future and therefore the 70% reduced stock price is a heavy discount. They have also said in their 10K that transition plans for the existing 8'100 members coming from this customer have not been made. It is  possible that they can stay with Ontrak, resulting in no revenue loss. Therefore I dont believe the stock price reflects the next two quartely results and is from a mid to long term perspective at a great discount.

Lets compare a loss of a big customer with other companies. Twilio (Nasdaq:TWLO) lost their biggest customer a few years back aswell. Now look what happened to the stock ever since. Losing a customer is not the end of the world. Ontrak has a proven product and service and will be able to grow substantially in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/zo3q32unh8s61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d1804e45c06ba7722934bd8f301fd5f5d751a8

Overall I am very bullish on Ontrak and believe they will be able to deliver great results in the future. Their soution plays into a few big trends of the next decade (AI and telehealth). The stock price is at a heavy discount and from a technical standpoint a breakout is inevitable. Their growth numbers and financials are phenomenal. The potential market is enormous.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

mnprvi,,StockMarket,post,1617999610,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 9, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 9, 2021**

Stocks traded higher in another record-setting session in the market. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) both recorded new intraday highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) kept building on recent momentum. Market participants continue to digest remarks from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for “actual progress rather than forecasts” to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserve’s employment goals. He said “The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that we’re talking about is a very serious issue.” 

Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, “We’ve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.”

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, “We’re still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. We’ve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see … the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.”

Coronavirus/COVID-19

ExpreS2ion and its joint venture partner AdaptVac are engaged in the development of a unique capsid virus-like particle (cVLP) COVID-19 vaccine, partly sponsored through a [***Horizon 2020 EU grant award***](https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies/r/expres2ion-announces-eu-grant-award-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-development-programme,c3054055) to the PREVENT-nCoV consortium to rapidly advance the vaccine candidate against COVID-19 into the clinical stage. The candidate vaccine is a cVLP applying ExpreS2-produced SARS-CoV-2 antigens, thereby creating a powerful immunogenic vaccine.

AdaptVac and [***AGC Biologics***](http://www.agcbio.com/), a global Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) for biopharmaceuticals have entered into a partnership for the scale-up and cGMP manufacture of the COVID-19 vaccine. In July 2020, AdaptVac and [***Bavarian Nordic***](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/), a fully integrated biotechnology company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of life-saving vaccines, have entered into a license agreement which provides Bavarian Nordic the global commercialization rights to the proprietary capsid virus like particle (cVLP) based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, designated ABNCoV2. For application of our proprietary protein production system ExpreS2, ExpreS2ion and AdaptVac have also entered into a license agreement for this project.

In addition to ExpreS2ion and AdaptVac, the PREVENT-nCoV consortium members are Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Institute for Tropical Medicine (ITM) at University of Tübingen, The Department of Immunology and Microbiology (ISIM) at University of Copenhagen, the Laboratory of Virology at Wageningen University, and Radboud University Medical Center. The first clinical Phase I/II study was initiated in March 2021.

### Breast cancer

Breast cancer is a widespread oncology indication affecting more than 1.3 million people worldwide annually, resulting in more than 450,000 deaths (Tao, 2015: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25543329). The most common treatment today is based on monoclonal antibodies, where the dominating therapy Herceptin (trastuzumab) generates annual global sales of USD 7 billion. The target product profile of AdaptVac's lead breast cancer project, AV001(HER2-cVLP), is tailored to be highly competitive both in terms of cost and efficacy, thus aiming at a significant market share.

In February 2021, ExpreS2ion signed a final patent license agreement with AdaptVac whereby ExpreS2ion exclusively licensed in AV001 (renamed ES2B-C001). This gives ExpreS2ion full control over and responsibility for driving this valuable asset forward, hereby realising the very significant value of this project.

ExpreS2ion Biotech Holding AB’s affiliate ExpreS2ion Biotechnologies ApS (“ExpreS2ion"") announces that the clinical trial application (CTA) for a clinical phase I/II study for the ABNCoV2 capsid virus-like particle (cVLP) based COVID-19 vaccine has been approved by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO) in the Netherlands. The clinical study is now starting with the enrolment of up to 42 study participants to investigate safety and secondary efficacy parameters. First human dosing is planned for March 12, 2021. The CTA approval is in line with the plans to present initial clinical Phase I/IIa results in Q1 2021. ([https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies/r/approval-and-initiation-of-the-covid-19-clinical-phase-i-ii-study-for-the-abncov2-vaccine,c3301820](https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies/r/approval-and-initiation-of-the-covid-19-clinical-phase-i-ii-study-for-the-abncov2-vaccine,c3301820))

**The ABNCoV2 COVID-19 vaccine**         

* The initiation of a first-in-human phase I/II open label dose escalation clinical trial, supported by the Horizon 2020 EU grant, was announced on March 8, 2021.           
* Following the initiation of the trial, the first-in-human dose was administered on March 15, 2021. Initial safety data from the study is expected in Q1 2021 and will be announced in April.
* Headline results from the study are expected by the end of June 2021.

The exclusive global licensee Bavarian Nordic, responsible for the clinical program and the commercialization of ABNCoV2, completed a directed issue and private placement of DKK 1.1 billion on March 10, 2021, of which approximately DKK 200 million, corresponding to SEK 270 million, will support an additional phase I/II clinical trial and scale-up of the manufacturing.

mnflql,,StockMarket,post,1617969449,"Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days)These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,

mnbdyy,,StockMarket,post,1617950497,"Helpful guide on researching, analyzing & performing DD on stocks [15 things to consider looking at]Wanted to share this quick guide on things to consider looking at in a stock (15 points), when researching, analyzing or performing DD  (due diligence) on a stock. This post is not mine, I borrowed/re-shared from [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/) because I found it helpful, and wanted to share with other newer investors like myself!

&#x200B;

**Original post:**

A  lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when  considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this  guide together on the things I look at. I updated my post from 2 months  ago, to include links, and expand on some points.

(Before we begin, I do want  to take a quick moment to mention, that ETFs are the safer route (than  ""stock picking"") due to diversification. But, any  newer investors should consider ETFs before ""picking stocks"". Some some  ETF's I own are: $MGC for MegaCap, $IVV for S&P 500, $QQQ for  NASDAQ, $VGT for Tech, $VOT for MidCap, $VBK for SmallCap, $ARK for  Innovation. With that being said, anyone who wants to do some  ""educated""/ ""researched"" gambling, keep reading.

There  points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock,  and where I get them from.  At  the end of the day, this is your money, and noone cares more about it  than you do. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my  preference. Everyone's ""recipe"" is different. Find what works for you!

&#x200B;

* **Know the company.**  I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do  they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their  products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

&#x200B;

* **Growth**.  I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news,  10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future  growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will  the company scale?

&#x200B;

* **Financial health**.  Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash  flows from operations positive? How are Investing & Financing  Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is  the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income  Statement Trend, etc.

&#x200B;

* **Earnings & revenue history.**  Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the  projections. Have they missed earnings? Have they beat earnings? Has  earnings remained flat or grew consistently?

&#x200B;

* **Valuations**.  How is this valuated? (PEG ratio, P/E ratio). Is it undervalued? How  does the valuations compare to peers or competitors in the industry?

2. *GuruFocus*: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/dcf](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/AAPL/dcf)

&#x200B;

* **Price upside/ targets & Analysts rating consensus**.  I am curious about what the analysts covering a stock think it's worth.  I look to see what the analysts covering it, have to say about the  price targets.

1. *TipRanks:* [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aapl/forecast)
2. *ChartMill*: [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/analyst-ratings)

&#x200B;

* **Charts Analysis and the technical indicators**.  I am curious about what the charts have to say about momentum, and what  prior prices and charting have to say about price prediction. I try to  read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can  predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? I  look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.

&#x200B;

* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:**  I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the  company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign

&#x200B;

* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?

&#x200B;

* **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock? Then is so, research why. This might be reasons to be weary.

1. ETFDB: [https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/](https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/)

&#x200B;

* **Recent News**.  I Google the company and look at recent articles. What are people  saying? What are bloggers saying? What is the news saying? Any new news?  Bad news? Good News? Reasons for movement in recent stock price?

&#x200B;

* **Average volume**  traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How  easy can I trade it. How large/small are the bid/ask spreads?

mnbdyy,gtwk9yh,StockMarket,comment,1617950758,Saving to read in the morning,
mnnwp2,,StockMarket,post,1617994098,"UAVS - analysis : 4/9/2021UAVS - analysis : 4/9/2021


$UAVS is working on their delivery drone prototypes, but currently produces agricultural (farming) drones.

They have a non disclosed “world leading e commerce partner,” which contributed to a 4X revenue bump YoY.

Their facility was relocated to Wichita, Kansas.  conveniently  just 1.4 miles from a very large $AMZN facility.

More conveniently the  $AMZN facility has direct access to hundreds of miles of open land, which can be used for agriculture (farming).

$AMZN bought Whole Foods a few years back and had also been quietly opening Amazon Fresh grocerie stores around the USA.  

$AMZN does not presently grow their own crop to sell in their growing food chain business. 

The idea of $AMZN teaming up with $UAVS for use of their agricultural (farming) drones doesn’t seem like an out of the ball park idea.  

The location of their facilities seems to be coordinated, and the testing of drones in rural open areas makes sense, while regulations get sorted out for package deliveries in urban areas.

Clearly the regulations around package deliveries will take years, and the farming industry alone, will allow for necessary trial and error when testing the drones.  Not to include additional growth opportunity, and an accelerated timeline to that growth showing on their financials.  

Bonitas Research only accused AgEagle of fraud because they did not deny “rumors” of an Amazon partnership when questioned, but instead stated that they,  “are under NDA with a major e-commerce partner”.

Based on my finding I wonder if Bonitas could actually be long UAVS and used the hit peace to scoop up discounted shares.  

The geographic evidence is too strong for me to entertain the idea this partnership isn’t the real deal.","['BLL', 'AMZN']"

mock33,,wallstreetbets,post,1618087078,"Will DFV exercise his contract for 50,000 GME shares next Friday? And how heavy a catalyst will it be?It’s my understanding the diamond sacked animal that is u/DeepFuckingValue, is in possession of an options contract worth 50,000 shares of GME.

According to his YOLO updates, it’s due to expire next Friday. Market makers will need to deliver him the shares if he doesn’t sell the contract (IMO if he were the type to sell the contract he’d have done it before now, I don’t know maybe at $480 or after at $300? But his hands are completely carbonised diamond lattice burgers)

Now. It’s also my understanding, from reading posts by you glorious apetards, that the decreased volume may have reduced Implied Volume in the options market. And the lowering price has decreased the increments of contract prices (I.e 160,170,180 as opposed to 200,250,300) Does this increase the effectiveness of a gamma squeeze on the price, due to lower price increments and other Greek related stuff?

I’m just curious to what others think of this as a potential catalyst for initiating upward momentum on GME share price. 

I’m a simple U.K. 🇬🇧  ape and don’t trade options, just buy and hold with crusty diamond fingers. I’m trying to educate myself with the view of trading options in the future. I’m also a degenerate, brain damaged mess, so if non of this makes sense then what do you expect? I’m only here for the legacy.

mol6ms,,wallstreetbets,post,1618119292,"If you expect to become a multi-millionaire soon, take advantage NOW and save yourself from millions of dollars(or bananas) in taxesSo, this is kind of a specific scenario, but I think it's one that a lot of Redditor's find ourselves in, so I figured i'd share my thoughts on how to protect a portion of any gains if you expect to make a ton in the near future. Look at any millionaire/billionaire/trillionaire in the news and you can be sure they're protecting their companies and investments from any unnecessary tax liabilities, and the same should apply for apes who are investing. If you're going to be a millionaire soon, you need to start thinking like a millionaire and planning so that you can reduce the amount that you'll owe. NOW in particular because there's a deadline for this, especially if you fit the following scenario.

\---*This particular tax-scenario might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so pay attention and do your own research. This isn't tax or financial advice, so please reach out to someone who can help you navigate all the rules, but you still have time to look into it if you want to save some bananas. ---*

Most of us retail traders are people who are scraping by, or maybe living comfortably but definitely not buying yachts on the weekend, or running hedge funds attempting to short companies into bankruptcy. That means you probably have a job where you report to most days, and take home a paycheck that gets taxed before it hits your bank account. If your income is below a certain threshold, and you have some extra money sitting around, you're allowed to put those already-taxed dollars into a retirement account and allow it to grow tax-free on a number of securities or assets(including stocks and even property), and the IRS doesn't mind since they don't expect you to take a couple of dollars and have that investment multiply exponentially. Notably, these retirement accounts allow you to invest into any stock, which *includes* stock in your favorite company. Any capital gains (let's say gains in a normal Robinhood account) are ordinarily taxed as a short-term or long-term capital gain depending how long you held those shares in your account(up to 37% depending on your gains and tax bracket), but if you were to buy/sell an IRA, you get to keep ALL of those gains in your IRA tax-free, regardless of short-vs-long-term holding or percentage gain. The caveat is that you're only allowed to make contributions up to a certain dollar amount (and you're only allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA up to a specific income level in a tax year).

The income limits for contributions into a Roth IRA in the 2020 tax-season are **$124,000 for a single-filer**(which let's be honest most of us are single anyways), and you're allowed to contribute **up to $6,000** in either a Traditional or a Roth IRA. But wait, we're already in 2021, and we left 2020(along with all the shutdowns, quarantines and the Tiger King) in the past, right? Well, the IRS allows you to make contributions to an IRA *up until* the tax filing deadline. For this year, they went ahead and gave us a blessing in disguise and extended the filing deadline to **May 17th 2021**, so you have an extra month to plan your taxes, and there's still time to take advantage of this tax-blessing. If you plan on becoming a millionaire from selling any stocks this year, you WOULD NOT be able to make contributions for the 2021 tax season in the Roth IRA example since your income would put you in a much higher tax bracket than the one for 2020, so this specific scenario is a limited-time offer, not redeemable in the future. Theoretically, you could take a couple dollars that you have lying around, fund an IRA account and let that money grow tax-free until you're old and wrinkly, then buy a tax-free Space-Tesla at retirement age with your gains.

Let's take a look at an example for a best case scenario in an ape-market and and an ape stock-exchange:

* Let's say your favorite ape stock last closed at \~158 bananas a share. You could take $6,000 that you had sitting around in an account and drop that into an IRA
* Let's assume bananas are $1 each on the open market. You could theoretically take those $6,000 and purchase 6,000 bananas in your IRA as an investment asset
* You could then setup a limit order in your IRA to execute if the price of that ape-stock were to drop a bit on Monday morning, let's say to 157.89 bananas for sh!ts and giggles(.89 bananas are those little stringy things that all apes peel off before eating them)
* If that order executes, you'd get a nice round number of 12 ape-shares to hold in your IRA
* You could then go file your taxes for 2020, and claim this contribution to lock in your future gains tax-free.
* Hypothetically, the aforementioned ape stock could shoot up in value into stratospheric levels never before seen in the history of the ape-market. If you were to sell them all at ohhh idk, let's say 1,000,000 bananas each, this IRA would save you about $4.4 million in taxes after exchanging those bananas back into U.S. Dollars because the IRS doesn't accept bananas as payment, just FYI
* If you somehow managed to sell each ape-share for 10,000,000 bananas, you'd be saving yourself about $44.5 million in taxes

It's important to note that you can only fund the account with cash, so you can't transfer any shares that you already own into the account. This has to do with the fact that you'd have unrealized losses and gains in those shares, which would create a tax-nightmare for the IRS's purposes, so you'll need to transfer cash(or a check equivalent) into your account before being able to use the IRA, but hopefully you all have some money set aside for buying any dips in the market (if there were to hypothetically be a synthetic fire-sale in the future created by hedge funds). You'll need to do some research on which type of IRA is best for you, and all the rules regarding funding the account, but it seems like a Roth IRA has more favorable conditions, although a Traditional IRA allows you to deduct those $6,000 from your taxes so start reading and see what works for you. You won't be able to touch that money until you're 59-1/2(or after a 5-year holding period if you're a wise-old-ape who is nearing retirement age, which also allows a max contribution of $7,000), but that shouldn't be a problem if you make millions in gains in the near future, just don't keep your entire portfolio in it or you'd be creating a taxable event if you wanted to withdraw any money early. There are qualified exemptions like withdrawing for certain educational expenses, purchasing your first home, certain medical expenses, and other unforseen expenses, but you'll need to do some research if you think you may want to use any of those exemptions.

If you have Fidelity, it couldn't be easier to setup the account. I setup my main brokerage account a couple days ago and when the lightbulb went off in my ape-brain, I went to my account, submitted an application(which was pre-filled with all my account info), and I had the account setup in like 5 minutes, ready to be funded (other brokerages may take longer to open an account, that was just my experience with Fidelity). Thankfully i'm a procrastinator and haven't filed my taxes yet, but if you've already filed your taxes for 2020, you should still be able to take advantage of this with an amended tax return, just make sure you talk to a tax-professional who can guide you through it or submit paperwork on your behalf.

Hopefully we all see life-changing amounts of money hitting our bank accounts this year, and if this scenario sounds like you, please do some research and consider opening a tax-sheltered IRA. Your future self will thank you, and you can still hold onto your stock in your main brokerage accounts, just make sure you're aware of any tax implications coming down the line. I have another post for dealing with any gains in your main spending account coming soon, so stay tuned for that and good luck!

I am a regular Ape who barely knows how to read, so talk to a Financial-Ape or a Tax-Ape if you want to save some bananas on your Ape-taxes. ---*

TLDR: If you made less than $124,000 in 2020 as a single-filer, you can put $6,000 into an IRA and any gains from buying/selling your favorite stock would be kept tax-free. The deadline for funding an IRA for the 2020 tax season is May 17th 2021. Tax situations are wildly different for each individual ape, so do your own research and talk to a tax-professional to see if you can reduce your tax liability, ESPECIALLY if you expect to make any trades this year that would put you in a different tax bracket for 2021",['TSLA']

mordu1,,wallstreetbets,post,1618150508,"AMC Stock Price: Factors Working Against the Company at the MomentInitially posted on [r/AMC\_meltdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMC_meltdown/), cross-posting here to solicit some additional input and counter-points to refine and adjust the list, as needed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The   purpose of this post is to provide an objective, rational review of  the  adverse factors that already have impacted the price of AMC stock,  or  may do so in the future. These factors continue to be largely  ignored by  the mainstream subreddits.

This   is not financial advice or analysis, but rather a restatement of   publicly available data to counter some of the overly optimistic or   straight up misleading “DDs”  that choose to gloss over the reality of   the company’s fundamentals.

&#x200B;

1. **AMC market cap and price per share was in steady decline pre-Covid**

* [Market cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap) has been declining since 2017 (highest point circa 6.3B in 2017 compared to 2.6B in 2018, 1.7B in 2019 and then 4.24B today) even pre-Covid.

&#x200B;

2. **AMC’s shares were significantly diluted in the past 12 months**

* AMC issued 278M new shares in the past 12 months

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   “During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 91.0 million shares…   In January 2021, we sold approximately 187.0 million shares.”

* Additionally,   more shares were issued to AMC’s debt holders (convertible notes)  which  exercised their rights to convert those notes into shares. This,   however, helped reduce company’s debt and annual interest expense (but   worsened the dilution).

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   “The January 2021 conversion by holders … of our … Notes … into shares   of our Class A common stock…, which resulted in the issuance of   44,422,860 shares.”

* Even more shares were added to the float through various programs such as stock based compensation program, [*increasing the float*](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/amc/) *from 52M to now 450M in a span of a little over a year*.

&#x200B;

3. **Request to authorize more shares may lead to significant further dilution**

* AMC requested its shareholders approval to issue up to 500M additional shares ([SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)), which would effectively more than double the float.
* While   no immediate share issuance is proposed, as indicated above AMC did  not  hesitate to rather materially dilute its shares in 2020/Q1 of 2021.

&#x200B;

4. **AMC balance sheet continues to be severely burdened with debt**

* [Total liabilities](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/chart/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=id:liabilities,include:true,,&chartType=interactive&correlations=&dateSelection=range&displayDateRange=false&displayTicker=false&endDate=&format=real&legendOnChart=true&maxPoints=&note=&partner=basic_850&quoteLegend=true&quotes=&recessions=false&redesign=false&scaleType=linear&securities=id:AMC,include:true,,&securityGroup=&securitylistName=&securitylistSecurityId=&source=false&splitType=single&startDate=&title=&units=false&useCustomColors=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=5&chartView=&liveData=false) increased from 6.6B in 2017 to 8B in 2019 to now 13.3B in 2021
* Further   increases in debt may cause share prices to drop. AMC is cautiously   optimistic about having sufficient cash to last them through March 2022,   but this is contingent on theaters starting to generate significant   revenue by Q3

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   “\[F\]uture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our Class A   common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could   adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock

Was someone naked shorting stocks for the big boys to try and impress them so he's finally let in on the big boy conversations? [SEC 13-F filings and stock price data analysis] [Evidence-backed DD]Hey guys,

**by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:**

Of course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and **if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.**

Apart from being **a fraudulent short seller**, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.

For the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a **Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000** across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis.

&#x200B;

**In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:**

mocpd2,,wallstreetbets,post,1618087568,"EDIT - everything tastes better crisprThis is going to be the first post of 5 regarding crispr, and why it's the play of the decade 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀. Mods, thank you so much for letting me post it. If there's anything I need to do I'm happy to make any *edits* (no pun intended).

The next post will be about their current drug pipeline. This DD series is the product of 80 hours of reading 10-k's, licensing agreements, court filings, and a lot of adderall. 

**Intro**

**What is crispr?** Crispr stands for **c**lustered **r**egularly **i**nterspaced **s**hort **p**alindromic **r**epeats. It's a tool that is found in bacteria that can simply put can edit genes.

**Why should I care?** Crispr is easily on of the biggest discoveries of the 21st century, and [received a Nobel for its discovery last year](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/). It's not an understatement that in the next coming years crispr will impact just about every part of our lives. It's not just me saying this.[ Bill Gates \(poured in $100M\)](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/bill-gates-thinks-gene-editing-artificial-intelligence-save-world/), and [momma Cathie](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/editas-stock-price-ark-cathie-wood-genomic-stocks-driving-returns-2020-12-1029911942) believe that this is one of the most revolutionary things of this century. [Joe Davis of Vanguard found the idea multiplier to be similar to how the internet took off](https://advisors.vanguard.com/e-assets/articles/FAS008905/Todays-ideas-in-genetics-and-biomedicine-are-multiplying-quickly.png).

If you cannot see this can change the world crispr could help [by eliminating that extra chromosome you probably have](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28633863/#:~:text=CRISPR%2FCas9%20genome%20editing%20can,to%20delete%20an%20entire%20chromosome.&text=show%20proof%2Dof%2Dconcept%20for,embryonic%20stem%20cells%20and%20zygotes). 

**Editas ($EDIT)**

Editas is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on using crispr as a treatment for genetic disorders (in vivo), and for various forms of cancer (ex vivo). 


Their business model is actually pretty smart. They're targeting rare diseases for drug development, and licensing out the IP for crispr. Contrary to popular belief rare diseases are incredibly profitable, and easier to develop. You essentially can monopolize a disease, and the market is so small competitors rarely pop up. The IP though is going to be the breadwinner. Essentially **any drug developed with crispr will give an 8%-13% royalty to $EDIT**. Not to get too technical, but their technology platform is pretty revolutionary, and [far exceeds anything else on the market](https://imgur.com/a/RHVZ6Wn). [They estimate they can target about 95% of the human genome.](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/node/8291/html) 


One drug of note in their pipeline that is of interest is EDIT-201. EDIT-201 is essentially engineered T cells with CARs and Engineered TCRs that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells. This is an interesting treatment solid forms of cancer. This could potentially be an alternative, or complementary to chemotherapy. The collaboration is with Juno Therapeutics (acquired by BMY) who have so far contributed substantial funds towards the project along with resources. Others include sickle cell, usher syndrome, and a form of genetic blindness that are all in clinical trials.


**The patent**

$EDIT has the exclusive license for use of crispr in humans through the BROAD institute. There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent. This has been a decade long quarter billion dollar legal battle over who owns crispr that is coming to a close. [To say the patent battle is simple is a huge understatement](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). But, there is a consensus slowly [forming that $EDIT will acquire the patent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/latest-round-crispr-patent-battle-has-apparent-victor-fight-continues). The winner for the patent will easily make billions off of the IP. If Broad wins the patent it is the responsibility of EDIT to develop drugs based off of crispr, and license the patent to other companies which $EDIT would collect a royalty of. $EDIT is then set to pay a royalty from that revenue to the Broad Institute. $EDIT already has licensing agreements in place with Juno Therapeutics ($BMY), and [$BEAM therapeutics (page 31-32)](https://investors.beamtx.com/node/6596/html). 


**The catalysts**

Biotech has a lot of catalysts. It doesn't take a lot to send it to the moon. In the short term there's drug trials. [A notable YOLO came from one of our very own with just shares where he turned $12k into $322k in a week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kahcek/account_was_at_12k_last_week_and_i_expect_to/). Editas is scheduled to present this weekend at the American Association of Cancer Research's annual conference. On December 4th Editas presented data from their EDIT-301 trial, and then [put out a press release](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-preclinical-data-and-large-scale) which caused the stock to go from $33-$99 the following weeks. **This will be peanuts compared to when the patent is awarded which is why I believe shares, or LEAPs are the safest choice**. The FDA was slowed by covid so I'm expecting biotech to have a big year as they catch up on trials. 

**Positions**

100 @ $23.56

10 $50c 4/16

1 $53c 4/16

20 $60c 4/16

I am long on shares, and will be buying leaps as the trial dates for the crispr patent gets closer. I bought some 4/16 calls because I noticed an incredibly bullish amount of calls for this week last Monday.

**Disclaimer**

I have a degree in molecular bio, and I've been following this closely for the past 5 years. A company that should be on your radar is Caribou Biosciences which unfortunately right now is private. Caribou has the patent for the use of crispr in non-humans which will also be an incredibly lucrative market.

mov6hh,,wallstreetbets,post,1618162399,"WARNING: Last week I made a partial account transfer from TDA to Fidelity, and I noticed something very peculiar this morning. Please read this if you have initiated any sort of account transfer, as it's extremely important.**Background:**

I have securities spread over Vanguard and TDA, but wanted to ""diversify,"" and move some of my positions to Fidelity.

In my TDA account, WITH margin access, I have GME positions in 100% equity, e.g. not using margin.

This will be important later: I opened my Fidelity account WITHOUT access to margin.

**What happened:**

I initiated a partial account transfer from TD to Fidelity last Tuesday or Wednesday.  By last Thursday or Friday, I saw my transferred positions in Fidelity.  This morning, I downloaded the Fidelity mobile app  and saw that my GME position was in MARGIN, which I thought was really odd.

So I called both Fidelity and TDA and discovered the following:

Apparently, since my account with TDA has margin access, by default, any positions that are transferred are transferred as margin positions (from a TDA rep).  One of the major problems with this is that since my Fidelity account does not have margin access, I was told that I would NOT be able to sell my GME positions until they were either transferred to cash or I gave my Fidelity account margin access (from Fidelity rep).

Fidelity was able to transfer my position to a cash position, and told me that this would have eventually happened since I don't have a margin account, but it could have taken a bit.  So please be careful when doing this sort of process.  This was pretty alarming to me and you should know about this.",

So My story -

Started in July 2020 with $1.3k( no options) I didn't know what the fuck I was doing

Took a £10k loan in November to buy some internet money-> made about £4/5k and YOLO'ed it all in GME in December/Jan ( sat on 754 shares)

Paper-Handed all 754 shares on ( wait for it) ----> Tuesday eve Jan 26th....( total $108k)

FOMO kicked in the following day-> went back in ..kept buying dips..... paper-handed again in the end and took a $40k loss from previous profits.

Went YOLO again around the time when DFV doubled down.... I keep adding as and when I have a spare $.

**Im not Selling.** **No more Paper Handing.** **~~I Stand Retarded~~**\*\*. I Stand United. I Hold. And I Buy.\*\*

Overall- Currently @$99k profits..

( GME 887 -> average about $110)

ATH profit -> $193k in March 2021

This DD compares several different time frames of GME's past price and volume to now to show similarities, where we currently are in relation to historical prices, and where we could go. This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

EDIT: before you read this, this is NOT a prediction, this is just a comparison of the past to now to show where we COULD be going. Stock price action often repeats itself but this is not a guarantee or prediction by any means.

**The big view**

This chart gives you an overview of the time frames I will be comparing. I will first be comparing the red and green squares to show that they are extremely similar in price action and volume. After that, I will be analyzing the blue square to demonstrate where we could be going in the next days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares share extremely similar price and volume action:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wxyicfgt2ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d124ea21c5ee141916a81feec9c5a1557df4bbb

**Where we've been vs. where we are (red and green square comparison):**

https://preview.redd.it/ruqqmrmz2ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4ac0ba2ec4ea3108947c311435f86a920325444

**Color-coded explanation for the above two charts:**

https://preview.redd.it/3hc8za4p3ds61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2a48f4ac2b7514bcc166dadfac4178109dc2d

As you can see, the similarities are uncanny. The volume patterns are identical, the two peaks follow the same pattern, the first peak is lower than the second but has higher volume, the second peak is immediately followed by a rapid drop in price, and the reaction to earnings and eventual recovery are extremely similar.

**Where we could be going**

The below chart is the blue square in the large-view chart. This represents where we could be going in the coming days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares that I compared are extremely similar. It follows that because the red and green squares are so similar and this blue square follows the red square, we could see similar price action to this square in the future. This indicates that we still have a few more days/weeks to go before the actual squeeze but that we should see a substantial increase in price very soon. Is this a guarantee? Not at all! This is simply using past data to make a prediction about the future. We very well could see the squeeze sooner or later than what this predicts!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j1l3h0hd4ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a88a66388e592b46edf741512b6dec1a3e6fc69c

There you have it! According to historical similarities in GME's price movements, we are in for a substantial increase in price in the coming days, we will then see a consolidation period, we will then see a monstrous jump followed by a slight consolidation, then the squeeze will take us to tendie town. The differences in these squares are that (obviously) the current price is about 10x higher than the previous price, however, they still follow a similar pattern. Though the price action is similar, this current pattern (green) seems to be moving quicker than the past pattern (red). If, in the coming days/weeks, GME's price and volume are similar to the blue square, that indicates that we should be on deck for the MOASS and, because the current price is substantially higher than the past price, this squeeze will be SIGNIFICANTLY larger in price. Again, do not take this as a fact, this simply uses historical price and volume to give a picture of where we COULD be going.

**TL;DR**

The current GME volume and price action follows pre-January trends extremely similarly. Using the past to predict the future, we should see a substantial jump soon followed by consolidation, followed by a monstrous jump, followed by consolidation, and then the tendie squeeze. Again, this is not a guarantee, this is a potential scenario based on past similarities to know.",

**E-Commerce:** Alibaba has growing competition from companies such as JD and Pinduoduo in the e-commerce space, but still holds a dominate position with 56% of the current market share, and can continue that momentum given that China expects retail sales to make up 52% of e-commerce sales in 2021, which is up from 44.8% a year prior, and also expects the trend to tick upward through 2024. The most recent earnings release showed a 38% increase in revenue from their core e-commerce space.

**Cloud Computing Services:**  
\- Revenue for the company's cloud computing business grew 50% year over year to $2.47 billion.  
\- Alibaba Cloud achieved positive adjusted EBITA during the quarter   
\- With Alibaba's cloud computing business beginning to take off, there is still plenty of room to add to its overall source of revenue considering that it currently makes up just 7% of their revenue.  
\- Furthermore, the US cloud market is currently about 8 times larger than China's, giving them much more room for growth and more opportunity for Alibaba to capitalize.

**Company outlook and why I am bullish on the stock:**  
\- Alibaba stock is currently down roughly 30% from is all time high  
\- BABA is expected to grow revenues by 39% this year  
\- BABA is expected to grow revenues by 31% in 2022  
\- BABA is expected to achieve EPS of $10.14 in Fiscal 2021  
\- BABA is expected to achieve EPS of $11.61 in Fiscal 2022  
\*\*\* with the stock currently sitting at $223.31, it is trading just 22 times fiscal 2021 EPS and 19 times fiscal 2022 EPS, and with the expected revenue growth, this seems like a cheap stock at the moment. Also, with an EPS last year of $8.08 and an estimate this year of $10.14, that shows an expectation of 25% YOY EPS growth, again, making the stock look cheap.

**Risks and potential reasons not to buy the stock:**  
\- BABA was just fined $2.8B for anti-trust bullshit  
\- crackdowns from Chinese gov't can hinder their growth potential and market share dominance  
\- Bill Gates investment team dropped their position in BABA  
\- There have been talks that they may be forced to divest some of their non-core business segments

**TL;DR:**  
BABA has been under a lot of pressure lately due to regulations and crackdowns on tech firms by the Chinese gov't causing the stock to currently trade 30% off its all time high. They just had to pay a $2.8B fine. Aside from this, the company is expected to grow revenues by 39% this year and 31% next year. It is currently trading 22 times Fiscal 2021 EPS and 19 times Fiscal 2022 EPS which makes the stock attractive given the company's expected revenue growth. With how cheap the stock is, and how well the company is expected to grow, the stock can be viewed as both a value and growth stock. With the $2.8B fine out of the way, I believe the selling of BABA is nearing an end, and now set to moon. My boy Charlie Munger agrees with me (he just bought BABA to make for 19% of his equity portfolio).

Personally overall, I am quite happy with just the sub $3B fine. Yes it is a lot, and although this may have other implications, I feel for the most part that this is the only concrete bad for BABA.

With all of its business segments experiencing such momentous growth still and dropping the bad press, BABA has a bright future ahead of it.

Particularly excited for their cloud play.

moak5a,gu3c738,wallstreetbets,comment,1618096280,"3 major things.    
     
#1.   
Imports are brutally delayed. We get a lot of produce from South America, especially outside of our normal produce season April-December) which mostly comes from WA, OR, ID, CA, AZ. Most imported produce shipped via ocean on container vessels. The demand of empty containers in China far exceeds demand anywhere else in the world right now thanks to WFH culture, Pandemic, and various direct to consumer sales. Most large steamship companies have vessels on the water moving with about 50%-60% of the shipping containers onboard completely empty in order to get them to China and the eastern hemisphere to meet the demand. Right now to get a container from Long Beach to Hong Kong costs around $3k. The other way.. HK to LB is around $8k. Simple supply and demand. There’s a bottle neck of inbound US imports coming from our international suppliers.    
      
#2.     
There’s no produce shortage in the US from domestic supply. However there’s a **VERY** key shortage effecting produce getting on shelves. There is a trucking/driver shortage. Freight rates have escalated drastically in the last 12 months. Some lanes as low as 30% but some lanes as high as 300%. This is effecting produce movement more than anything. The buyers/retailers have been priced in, and so have the growers/shippers/packers. This cost in freight is a constant battle between all parties who’ve been priced in working and planning off low margins for ages. Loads are sitting on docks for days and weeks.     
     
#3.     
Produce season is about to start in CA, AZ, WA, TX, FL and all over the country. All retailers will be promoting local and supplementing from other US regions, and imports will slowly trickle in.    
        
————————————————— 
     
The guy working at Aldi is a retard. The play is logistics and trucking IMO.   
I do a lot of trucking for Aldi, and they just gave us a 25% raise in rates. They’ve been one of the more challenging customers to negotiate raises.. same with Trader Joe’s. We’ve let their shit sit and arrive late quite a bit. Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, HEB, LIDL, Meijer, Publix, Target, Sprouts, and Giant Eagle have all been a lot faster to cough up more dough to meet the spot market freight rates.","['LB', 'WMT', 'KR']"
modli5,,wallstreetbets,post,1618090552,"TQQQ is an excellent long term investment, even with 50+% volatility.I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the ""real investors"" want to ignore these statistics.

I posted this over in r/stocks and the reception was not too positive so I thought to myself, ""who would be dumb enough to agree with me?"" Well, here I am!

Every time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.

Instead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. ""Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day"" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. 

This is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.

http://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN

Over 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.

And if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.

Do I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. 

TLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.

Other results for average incomes:
1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return

modli5,gu331dc,wallstreetbets,comment,1618091217,RemindMe! In 10 years “TQQQ banger”,
modli5,gu3ho92,wallstreetbets,comment,1618099373,"So this strategy already exists and is considered a relatively safe investment with at least 30 percent bonds (which would provide you roughy 210% percent exposure to the stock market). It is usually done with UPRO for the S&P although some of the more adventurous individuals also use TQQQ. The bonds are also leveraged 3x to protect downside. There is a whole thread on Bogleheads dedicated to it with years of DD by some of the most safe oriented investors you can find (very different from the Wallstreet Bets audience): [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192)

There is also a work by Yale economists Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff that popularized the notion of ""Lifecycle Investing"". They look boring enough as individuals that I'm inclined to take them seriously: [http://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/](http://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/). I have read the book and it tests the strategy across even the worse markets.

That said. You will need to rebalance about quarterly to make this work. The current recommended way is through M1 finance, which provides a simple option. It is what I use myself. I'm not paid by M1 or anything. I just found it from this article when searching information about this approach: [https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/)

The paper you have linked to seems to be missing large parts of the myth busting around leverage etfs. The original paper is entitled *""*Alpha Generation and Risk Smoothing Using Managed Volatility.""

This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjzvwy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made last week. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**                     

https://preview.redd.it/1dwe1p42xcs61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a120cb970f727a95b925dca045324d6d551ba473

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock though there has been a significant drop in the overall number of mentions (last week GME was mentioned 27K times). Tesla is now the number 2 most discussed stock. Facebook is the newcomer into the top 10 list but not in a good way. They had one of the largest data leaks (533 Million customers data was compromised) and the users were understandably pissed. The average sentiment across the comments reflects that. ASO also made it into the top 10 due to chatter on the stellar earnings report as well as the high short interest on the company.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/0l6jei65xcs61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=3008545684de903944b2b4840d2c7e428e1442d9

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. 

**Romeo Power ($RMO)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. The stock was trending due to a 60% jump in stock price on Tuesday following a strategic deal they announced with truck giant PACCAR. 

**Nano-X Imaging($NNOX)** is a medical imaging technology company. They recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. NNOX’s CEO has said that the company is on track to commence system shipment’s from Q4'21. The company’s stock price shot up 20% only to lose over the next week.

**Academy Sports($ASO)** has been on the top growing stocks for two weeks now (which in turn made the stock figure in the top 10 most discussed stocks list). The company was mentioned heavily due to its stellar earnings report (EPS was an impressive 41% ahead of analyst estimates). Adding to this, the company is heavily shorted (\~40% short interest) and the stock price is expected to be highly volatile.

**Facebook($FB)** as discussed above was trending due to their data leak which exposed the user data of more than half-billion users. 

**Norwegian Cruise line($NCLH)** was generating discussions as its CEO has sent a proposal to the CDC on how the company could safely travel once again in July. The company is also planning to resume cruise operations for voyages boarding outside of the United States with sailings originating in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Greece starting in July 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:** 

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

mo96ty,,wallstreetbets,post,1618076151,"PSFE: An undervalued play with relatively low risk and high upside potential&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h0hmwro2tds61.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5a271834a7f7e708b95da87853cb3d9f3bec52b

I am currently holding 384 shares of Paysafe at a cost basis of around $14.25 and plan to add more to my position under the $14 price point. I generally look for plays that have relatively low downside risk while also offering high potential returns. My current plan is to hold the majority of my PSFE shares for at least 2-3 years while the company expands and also to purchase a bit of commons to sell off after the first upswing.

Paysafe's company started in 1996. It offers several payment platforms including Skrill and Neteller which operate in many parts of Europe and is now growing in the US with the rise of online gambling. Much of it's revenue comes from processing fees that customers pay to make transactions with companies like DraftKings, eToro, Coinbase, RentMoola, Twitch, etc.

Paysafe has grown their revenue to 1.5 billion in 2021 with .4 billon of that growth occurring within the past 4 years. As online gambling becomes more widespread in the US and possibly soon in Canada, these revenues could increase substantially. They have a great team of entrepreneurs and seasoned executives from Paypal, Facebook, and Barclays. The team is led by Bill Foley who took the firm public this year via a SPAC and has plans to grow the company over the next several years. He is admired by Wall Street for his successful track record in helping companies to succeed.

PSFE is one of the few SPACS that have held up past the merger and this has happened even in light of the recent overall decline in sentiment in SPACS as a whole. Since the first announcement, it has maintained a steady average of around $14-15 with a low of around $13.50 and a high of around $19.50. There is a very low short volume on PSFE, which at best is bullish and at worst is neutral for this company.

Some possible risks include competing payment solutions and the insider lock up period which may drop later this fall.  In spite of that Paysafe has a great leadership team, a steady revenue stream, and is poised to grow. I could easily see it hitting $22-24 in the short term and $45 by some time next year. IMHO, this is not one to YOLO some calls on. It will require some patience, at least until the first earnings date hits and this stock starts to get some more traction and direction.

mobfip,,wallstreetbets,post,1618083344,"American Tower (AMT): the best way to play the coming 5G boom.**American Tower**

For those of you that actually enjoy reading a good DD, this one is for you. I have followed Wall Street Bets for a while, and personally, I can’t wait for GameStop and AMC to fade away so people actually get back to posting about long ideas that might be worth my time and money. I know that some of you are busy gambling on dying businesses like GameStop or AMC, but I’m here to let you in on a secret.

The company I will be diving into today is the single best way to play the coming 5G boom in America and the expansion of existing cell networks around the world. American Tower (AMT) is the world’s largest REIT with a market cap just over 100B and they are the largest owner of cell towers in the world. Some of you have already checked out because REITs are for boomers, but AMT is growing fast and is a vital piece of the world’s communication infrastructure. If you think that 5-10 years from now people around the world will own more cell phones, make more phone calls, and use more mobile data, AMT is a great way to get a piece of the growing 5G pie.

AMT builds cell towers around the world and then rents them out to telecommunications companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile (and the international equivalents). American Tower has over 186,000 communications sites in 21 countries around the world. One of the things that has me interested about AMT’s business model is that they can use a single cell tower to provide service for all three major carriers (and have the capacity to support up to 5 networks), which creates huge margins for each tower.

**Valuation**

Over the last year, the share price has fallen from a peak of 260 last summer/fall to around 240. This puts the Price to FFO (P/E for REITs) to around 26, which is about where it usually trades. I expect AMT to trade in the 25-30 P/FFO range as investors realize the long-term growth runway in front of the company, so there might be some multiple expansion left. I expect that the continued growth of earnings and dividends will lead to a significant increase in share price over the next couple years and beyond.

**Dividend Growth**

I know that most people here aren’t looking for dividends, but it is still worth seeing how fast AMT’s dividend has grown. From 2013, the dividend has grown nearly 5x. Again, I get that no one here could give a shit about dividends, but everything else being equal, rising dividends lead to a rising share price. I don’t think we will see the same rapid growth as the last eight years, but I do think AMT will continue to grow the dividend at a decent pace over the next decade.

Short version: Dividends = free tendies. Dividend increases = more free tendies for shareholders.

**Footprint and Competitors**

AMT has a presence on 6 continents, and they continue to grow naturally and through acquisitions. This January they acquired Telxius Towers, which greatly expands their footprint in Europe and Latin America. Post-acquisition, the company said the revenue split will be approximately 51% North America, 10% Europe, 14% Africa, 15% South America, and 10% Asia Pacific.

Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) are the only public competitors of note, but American Tower is bigger and has a larger international presence. You can look into both, but AMT is the best way to get international exposure to 5G.

**Customer Concentration and New Edge Data Centers**

The US telecommunications companies make up about half of AMT’s revenue, so there is some revenue concentration. The demand for data and cell reception is pretty inelastic though, so no matter what happens to AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile, AMT will continue to thrive. The cell tower market isn’t exactly a monopoly, but because one tower can serve the whole industry, competitors like CCI and SBAC aren’t likely to build new towers in the same locations as American Tower’s existing towers (and vice versa).

They also recently opened six edge data centers (think Fastly or Cloudflare) to keep up with new and improving technology. This is just the beginning, but for a firm that has the resources of AMT, they could choose to expand rapidly if management likes the opportunity.

**Conclusion**

I work at one of the Big 4 Accounting Firms, so I have a pretty good idea of what businesses are worth investing in and which ones to leave for the smooth brained apes around here. American Tower has the management, growth mindset, and secular tailwinds of 5G that will continue to drive market beating shareholder returns.

I have put about 10% of my Roth IRA into AMT and I spent my whole stimulus check on a couple of Jan2023 300 calls a couple weeks ago. I think AMT is somewhere close to fairly priced currently, but the growth and business model mean that buying at today's prices could look like a bargain in a couple years.

I know that a lot of people are going to keep speculating on GameStop, but eventually that will come to an end. If you guys are fine buying companies that lose shitloads of money and have to issue new shares just to stay afloat, that’s fine, but I prefer to buy pieces of businesses that are profitable. Either way, good luck out there fellas.

moacyl,,wallstreetbets,post,1618079886,"Apple-backed Chinese ride service Didi Chuxing files privately for IPO with ~$100B valuation* DiDi is a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing with over 550 million users and tens of millions of drivers. The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers.

*Owner and founder is Cheng Wei, ex Sales Manager of *BABA*, and Regional Manager of Alipay.

In 2014, Cheng hired Jean Liu (Liu Qing), a former *Goldman Sachs Asia* managing director, as the COO of the company.

In February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing or “DiDi”).

In August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of *Uber*.

Since the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the world’s highest valued tech start-ups.

By September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself ""Didi Chuxing"".

*2016: Acquisition of Uber China*

By the beginning of 2016, *Uber China*, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China.

In June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi.

On 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber.

In April 2019, *Uber* released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016.

* 2017–present: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement

In March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that *SoftBank Group Corporation* approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride-hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund.

On 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion.

In December 2017, *Reuters* reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.

In May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff. As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers.

In 2018, the company launched its ""Red Flag Steering Wheel"" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive.

In 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners.

* Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan. In January 2018, DiDi acquired 99, a Brazilian ride hailing app.

(Along with Apple’s $1 billion investment into Didi, the ride service giant’s major backers are SoftBank, Alibaba, and Tencent)

And connecting the dots looking back, with *Apple Car* plans possibly including a robo-taxi service, the company may have been able to learn a lot of valuable knowledge from its involvement with Didi over the last six years that it could leverage in a future ride service.

mo9re4,,wallstreetbets,post,1618077939,"MAXR DDOverview

MAXR or Maxar technologies is a space technology solutions firm. They specialize in satellite imagery, and provide services to NASA and the department of defense including robotics, earth imagery, and geospatial analytics and insight. This company has a long history working with NASA, in 1965 it was known as 'philco-ford', and designed and developed the Houston space center for the gemini and apollo missions. Since helping humans reach the moon for the first time, the firm has gone through a number of acquisitions, and acquired multiple other companies itself. Today MAXR has 4 satellites orbiting earth, which they use for their primary business which is imagery. 60% of their business is satellite imagery services, and 40% is space infrastructure. 

What do they do with their satellites?

MAXR uses satellite imagery to assist the various branches of the military. The company uses satellite imagery to locate mission critical locations of enemy warships, airbases, communications systems, and other physical infrastructure that the military might need to form a tactical plan.  MAXR is a key partner in us army's project TITAN, USDI's MAVEN, and NAVY's project Overmatch. The most exciting (imo) technology MAXR offers involves using geospatial data to identify the locations of individual shooters on the battlefield. Pretty crazy, but the company can use satellites to capture images of the battlefield, and provide imagery to soldiers on the ground that pinpoint locations of enemy footsoldiers. The companies AI can even recommend actions to take against the located individuals. 

In the infrastructure business, MAXR has recently delivered NASA a space bus for mission psyche that will be travelling to a resource rich asteroid between mars and Jupiter. As well as developing robotic arms for nasa's OSAM-1 mission. Whose goal is to service and repair satellites in orbit. (as a vast majority of satellites are non operational). Satellite repair and reconstruction could be a hugely profitable enterprise, as it would save costs on launching.

&#x200B;

Bullish arguments

1. Fundamentals. Fundamentally speaking, MAXR technologies is a very attractively priced company. The firm has generated revenue of 1.7 billion in the trailing 12 months, with a gross profit margin of 730 million, or 42%. Compare that 730 in gm to the companies market cap of 2.76 billion and you realize the firm is very undervalued. 2.7billion$ market cap/730 million annual gm=3.69 market cap/profit. Which is quite low. (to put in context aapl=19, pltr=65, ktos=16, mcd=17, amzn=18, intc=6). This essentially means that if you bought the entire business, you'd make your money back on just the profits in under 4 years. 
2. Extremely difficult industry to enter, so threat of new competitors is very low. 
3. Much of the firms business is with multi year, government contracts. So business is locked down for a while. This could be a downside if the company loses a major contract however. 
4. Highly innovative company in a high growth sector. MAXR is the global leader in satellite imagery, No other company has nearly as many, or as important contracts with nasa and various defense agencies. Even Northrup-Grumman and Boeing aren't even close to MAXR when it comes to earth imagery services and advanced robotics engineering. 
5. Strong record of delivering net income available to common stock holders. (A lot of companies don't do this). 
6. Insider/institutional ownership. The firm is owned 66% by institutions, and recently awarded it's insiders 122,000 shares of stock options.
7. Technical analysis. The company is currently on a dip, after having found resistance around 41$ for months, before the stock offering.

Bearish arguments

1. Debt positions. The company has a large amount of debt. With over 2.5 billion of long term debt.
2. Recent dilution via stock offering. The company recently financed their debt by selling 400m of stock.
3. shrinking receivables. Accounts receivable are lower this year than any time in the past few years.

&#x200B;

disclaimer: I'm holding calls on this company. 

&#x200B;

Let me know what y'all think. I think the company is really undervalued, and it doing some extremely innovative and exciting things for satellite technology.","['INTC', 'AMZN', 'GM', 'BA', 'MCD', 'AAPL']"

mnyo31,,wallstreetbets,post,1618031864,"MVIS Technical Analysis- Microvision has broken out and is on the verge of another spike So, you FOMO'd into $MVIS, only to watch it go down all week.

Or maybe you were smart enough to realize you missed the bus, but still felt that twinge of *""what if??""*

Well, fear not, fellow retards, because I have broken out the crayons, read the tea leaves, and *allegedly* slaughtered a goat, spun it around in circles, and interpreted the blood splatter to predict the future, and I'm here to tell you that $MVIS is going to surge again, as early as next week!

u/WrathofKhaan did a great breakdown detailing the huge bull case [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/minugt/microvision_investment_thesis_and_summary_of_dd/), so I'm not going to get into that, but I will provide some TA to show you why it may be starting as soon as Monday.

Please note: I am retarded, this is my first time posting something like this, I am still learning, and I welcome any feedback or tips. Also, this is not financial advice, etc., etc.

To start, lets look at the 10-day chart to establish previous resistance, current support, and the stock's current pattern. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/trq7o5mi3as61.png?width=2676&format=png&auto=webp&s=75fbfd88582588b3bf5277c5fe719144c1e57986

If you pay attention to the pretty purple crayons (my most favorite flavor,) you will see that there was a clear resistance line at $13.75 from 3/25 to 3/31.  You will also see that after the spike on 3/31, the same $13.75 line has turned into a support line, establishing the base of the descending triangle the stock has been in for the past week.

Following the peaks since the 3/31 spike gives us the other leg we need to fully establish this pattern.

*“But wait!”* you might be saying. *“Descending bad! Stonks go up!”* 

Easy now, Chongo. Lets just zoom in a little to the 5-day chart so we can see what has been going on this week a little more clearly. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9smi88i54as61.png?width=2671&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f12003d28fcd831826b05c5b5d8ca03a7e5c4c

If you follow the pretty purple again, the first thing you will notice is that there was a **Bullish Breakout** in the last 30 minutes of trading this week. The decreasing volume throughout the pattern, combined with the spike at the breakout helps to confirm this. 

The next bits of confirmation we should look at are the MACD and RSI. If you don't know what these are, the important thing to note about MACD is that the crossover between the red and green lines generally means a change in price trend. Essentially, if red is above green, price is going up- if green is above red, price is going down- and lastly, the points where the two lines meet signify a current or impending trend change.

The important thing to know about RSI is that it is a number that oscillates between 0-100- when it hits 30, a stock is generally considered “oversold” and is due for a correction (stonk goes up,) and when it hits 70, the stock is generally considered “overbought” and is (you guessed it) due for a correction (stonk goes down.) 

However, these indicators can be kind of spotty at the scale we're at (15 minutes), so lets zoom back out to the 10-day chart, and switch over to the hourly scale. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kar7pail4as61.png?width=2683&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c3dd1f4c417f5e034b76bb4a87ea7c4bfdf780

Follow the tasty arrows, and you can now clearly see the history of MACD crossovers and price trend changes, along with where the MACD is now. 

This also gives us a better picture of RSI, showing that it is in an uptrend, but with plenty of room to go before approaching oversold territory. 

These indicators, along with the volume spike at market close, confirm the bullish breakout of the descending triangle pattern, and all of them combined point towards serious upward price movement in the immediate future.   

I'll see you retards on the moon.

mnu273,,wallstreetbets,post,1618013559,"Moderna (MRNA) is the Tesla of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology world. Moderna to reach $600 by 2023.**MY POSITIONS:** I believe in this company long term and think there's a great short term opportunity to buy it below recent price targets. The stock is trading well below its worth because of recent market turmoil and investors not yet grasping Moderna's endpoint. I have a history of buying call options on Moderna when it went on sale. I have over 1,000 shares of Moderna and also have $30k in call options for 4/30.

https://preview.redd.it/26ajcc31n8s61.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f28948ce2f58bb5875bad3ec923a057678a11f

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a scientist and I work at NYU and the CDC. Back in February 19 2020 before there was a single documented case of COVID in NYC my colleague (Dr. Mark Mulligan) hosted a seminar titled ""2019 Novel Coronavirus - A Pandemic Threat"" -- WHO was still hesitant to call COVID a PHEIC and the CDC was currently making recommendations against wearing masks. Mark shared that Moderna was a promising company and poised to deliver a vaccine for COVID sooner than anyone else and faster than anyone else had ever done in the history of the vaccine world. Mark went on to lead the clinical trials for Pfizer. A little over a year later and I'm fully vaccinated with Moderna.

On May 22, 2013 Tesla announced that it paid of its DoE loan 9 years early. It was roughly $19.42, it's now worth 34x as much. Moderna didn't get a DoE loan but they got grant funding and revenue well ahead of their financial plan. They're in a phenomenal position to do three things:

1. Increase production for their current operations
2. Fund additional research in flu vaccines and cancer
3. Pay back debt much earlier than initially projected just like Tesla did

A few times in a decade an innovation comes along that makes a great leap forward. Moderna is one of those leaps forward. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky started the artificial intelligence boom known as deep learning as he advanced an old idea that NYU professor Yann LeCun pioneered in the 90s, the major difference was timing -- both GPUs and data matured in a way where neural networks could flourish. Less than one year later Rob Fergus at NYU reproduced this work, demonstrating one of the most important conditions for growth -- reproducibility. For the vast majority of biotech companies in clinical trials, you're rolling a dice and crossing your fingers. Moderna's approach works, just like neural networks worked -- they will reproduce and mature their technology and apply it to numerous serious diseases and will soon have an expansive portfolio beyond COVID vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) and BioNTech have shown the technology behind MRNA is reproducible and primed to flourish -- MRNA is on a similar trajectory as deep learning. MRNA isn't a new idea nor were neural networks or electric cars, timing is everything.

Moderna makes highly effective vaccines for COVID and Flu (soon) that can be developed in a fraction of the time. That's not even the most exciting thing about this company. Moderna and BioNTech may truly treat cancer and not in the way that clickbait articles promise -- but in the way that we used to see HIV as a life threatening disease and now we see it as a treatable and manageable condition. Moderna will benefit from its highly optimized and nimble operations, it's running at a pace that other companies will struggle to catch up with. While BioNTech has talented scientists they needed Pfizer to hold their hands, Moderna (MRNA) has proven far more self-sufficient in navigating the world of business. AZN, NVAX, J&J -> have proven to be poorer choices. They're slower to deliver, they overpromised and underdelivered (J&J), they're less efficacious and more dangerous (AZN). Meanwhile Moderna is scaling up operations to deliver more than projected.

**Near term catalysts:** 4/14: vaccine day, 4/28: annual shareholder meeting

**Long term catalysts:** Curing some types of cancer \~2023

**Longer term catalysts:** Making highly tailored personalized medicine to treat once life-threatening diseases \~2040

**TLDR: Moderna is a game changer** with room to grow. It's REAL value and not a meme roller coaster that ends right back where it started. Moderna is the next Tesla, hop on and **ride it to the moon.**","['TSLA', 'PFE']"
