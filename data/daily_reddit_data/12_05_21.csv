nanrlu,,stocks,post,1620823410,"I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

Good shout. Whether it was due to insider knowledge in different sectors, or due to greater personal interest in particular industries or personal relationships shifting their stock picks that way, or whatever else, it would be a different analysis than your story/question focused on.

I'm just pointing out that most of what this sub has is confirmation bias which does have it's place and helps with the emotional circus of the stock market. Just remember it's not any better then ""the goons at CNBC."" I can give you just as many reasons for the S&P to be up 3% tomorrow as I can for it to be down 3% tomorrow. 

NOBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS! Now more than ever.

That being said, I get a bit annoyed with the ""I told you so and everyone should have known"" responses. It's easy to boast when you are right and in reality you could have just as easily been wrong.

It doesn't seem like a big deal until someone who lost a lot of money feels singled out like they are the only one who didn't see it coming. No this isn't about me but more what I witnessed in 2009. 

If a year from now the S&P is down 20% from where we are today we can justify it. If it is up 20% we can justify it. Doesn't mean we know anything today.

Palantir Proves Solutions Are Resonating, Growth Ahead

We are raising our fair value estimate for the narrow-moat company.

We are raising our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to $25 from $24 after its first-quarter results left us more bullish about its long-term prospects. While we do not expect GAAP profitability for years, we believe Palantir is prudently investing in ramping up its business to land a wider breadth of organizations from various industries, sizes, and geographic locations. Palantir constitutes a minuscule amount of overall U.S. defense spending and has an embryonic commercial customer base; however, once Palantir’s solutions are installed, we believe organizations can become reliant on its products. With shares trading around $19 in intraday trading, we believe investors have upside to capture in this disruptor.

Palantir’s revenue growth of 49% year over year topped our already aggressive expectations, thanks to resounding results in the government vertical and strong broad-based expansion within the U.S. Government revenue was the bright spot, growing 76% year over year. U.S. government business grew by 83%, led by defense and pandemic-related use cases. We do not believe Palantir’s non-defense government segment will fizzle out after businesses reopen, as we think the company is proving its software capabilities during a time of crisis, which can open the door and lead to proliferation across other government entities working to harness their data.

Commercial sales rose 19% and were impacted by certain geography lockdowns, although U.S.-based commercial growth increased 72% year over year. With Palantir’s push to modularize its offerings and expand its sales reach, commercial opportunities within the U.S. and U.K. increased by 2.5 times and commercial pilots more than doubled since February. Alongside the strong top-line results and expectations of continued strength ahead, Palantir also posted 34% adjusted operating margin (up 200 basis points sequentially) and 44% adjusted free cash flow margin.",

I think you're assuming that smart money is afraid instead of making a reasoned bet on what the future holds.

Edit - Consider that three weeks ago, I have in my trading journal that when we see ATH + crossing a major benchmark (in this case, 4,000 on the S&P 500), we often see a volatile consolidation period.  Most people should've seen this coming and adjusted based off their risk tolerance.",['SPGI']
narq4c,,stocks,post,1620834096,"Lesson learned from buying “the dip”.I began investing it the second half of 2020 and like most people, things were going very well until February hit. 

Everyone started saying “buy the dip” and “it’s on sale!” when a stock dropped 4-5% and it sounded like a good idea to make back a quick 5% once the stock recovered. However the dips kept coming and every 5-8% drop I kept “buying the dip”.

I now realized how 5-8% is barely a dip and I should’ve waited for at least a 10-15% drop in price before buying more. Now I’ve got little capital left to buy at these 30-50% drops from ATH and I just gotta weather the storm until (hopefully) these climb back up. Lesson learned.",

5% drops or larger can happen 3 times a year on average. These are small fry. Not bad to buy in on those 5 percenters but also not 'whip out the Warren Buffet cash reserves' time to buy.

naooit,,stocks,post,1620826166,"Electric vehicle Volkswagen embraces lidar for autonomous driving technology - VWAGY and possible IPO of Argo AITesla has been dismissive of lidar technology for its autonomous technology development.  What has been the result?

[Forget Tesla: Experts Say These 4 Tech Companies Are The Future Of Self-Driving Cars](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/best-autonomous-driving-companies)

> WE WERE PROMISED SELF-DRIVING CARS before the end of the last decade, and those predictions are turning out to be wildly, hilariously wrong. But things may be catching up — and the loser of the pack, according to Sam Abuelsamid of Guidehouse Insights, is Tesla, which may surprise droves of Elon-stans.

And:

> The report specifically calls out Argo’s testing on highways in Miami. “Highway driving capability will enable Argo-powered AVs to expand operating domains to more areas of the regions they serve,” says the report. It does note that Argo AI has not shown off its autonomous tech with public ride testing as Waymo has.

On the other hand, electric vehicle maker Volkswagen is embracing lidar for autonomous driving technology.

[VW Plans to Have Autonomous Microbus Ready for Roads in 2025](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/vw-plans-to-have-autonomous-microbus-ready-for-roads-in-2025-1.1602643)

> Volkswagen AG plans to offer a highly automated version of the hippie-era microbus it’s reviving as an electric van as the carmaker commercializes self-driving technology along with startup Argo AI.

> VW is preparing an ID.Buzz with Level 4 autonomy -- meaning the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions -- to be ready for commercial transport of people and goods for 2025. It’s testing Argo AI’s technology at six U.S. locations and will expand to a site in Munich this year to further refine the system.

And:

> VW stepped up its efforts in the space when it invested in and teamed with Argo while broadening an alliance with Ford in 2019. Europe’s largest automaker put its van unit in charge of the collaboration, as it’s betting self-driving technology can be rolled out for commercial use in designated areas faster than with passenger cars on public roads.

[VW will start testing its Argo AI-powered self-driving vans in Germany this summer](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany)

> Volkswagen will start testing its new autonomous vehicles in Germany this summer, the company announced Wednesday. The German automaker’s electric ID Buzz vans will use hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW. The aim is to launch a commercial delivery and micro-transit service in Germany by 2025.

And:

> “We’re building our technology and partnering with Volkswagen in a way that really sets us apart from what others are doing,” [Argo AI CEO Bryan Salesky] said. “And we think it really puts us in a position to deliver a safe, smart, and scalable product to deliver on the promise of autonomous driving.”

na6vzl,,stocks,post,1620765049,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve.

It beats S&P500 and all giant companies, it has reasonable P/E, it's well defended against the inevitable inflation - when the food price rises the earnings of this company should also rise. It looks like a great opportunity to hedge against the current market conditions. I'm also pretty sure that every other country has some local equivalent gem. Do I miss anything?

Those make up the backbone of my account and then I pick stocks based on my insights/interests. I wouldn't let someone sell me garbage high fee stocks. I also wouldn't mess around with penny stocks. By the time you get out you may have a nice nest egg to start the next step of your life. This strategy won't make you rich but it should preserve and grow some wealth for you in that time horizon. You don't have enough capital to make $$$$ on dividends so you need a balance of growth and stability, and that's what you get with a S&P index fund. Maybe if the market would crater again, then I'd use cash on hand to buy individual stocks, but over time and in your time horizon, dollar cost averaging into a low cost index beats just about every strategy.

na862w,,stocks,post,1620768302,"Unity Q1 revenue up 41%, exceeding expectations; company raises 2021 revenue outlook to $1 billionSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unity Software Inc. (NYSE: U), the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021.

“Our first quarter results are reflective of the powerful transition from linear 2D to real-time 3D, which is one of the most important changes in how people interact with technology,” said John Riccitiello, President and Chief Executive Officer, Unity. “We believe that real-time 3D will continue to grow at an accelerated pace and achieve massive scale.”

Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D (RT3D) content. With Unity, creators have the tools to become RT3D creators. Creators, ranging from game developers to artists, architects, automotive designers, filmmakers and others, use Unity to make their creative vision come to life. With this broad approach, we believe the opportunity to create and operate rich and immersive experiences is almost limitless, setting up Unity to not only anchor tomorrow’s most advanced applications but to enable and power the metaverse at the most foundational level.

“Execution in the first quarter was very strong with revenue of $234.8 million, an increase of 41% from last year. We are encouraged by the growth of our customers contributing more than $100K of trailing twelve-month revenue and the healthy dollar-based net expansion rate during the first quarter,” said Luis Visoso, Chief Financial Officer, Unity. “We continue to invest strategically in R&D and vertical expansion to enable Unity to lead the transition to real-time 3D.”

na862w,gxs7zkd,stocks,comment,1620770879,"There numbers are actually really great. Way better than a lot of high PS multiple companies out there.

Take for example NET. I love NET, but they put up revenue numbers of $145M for Q1 and projections of $616M for 2021. That If they hit their revenue projections, their forward P/S becomes 36 compared to the 49 it is today. So while I love NET, I see NET sliding into the 60's to hit a future P/S of 30.

Unity on the other hand is at a current P/S of 30, and their revenue numbers out did expectations and they upped their guidance. They expect to make $1B in revenues in 2021. This puts their future P/S at 20! Which is much more palatable than NET (or even CRWD).

The great thing about Unity also is their operating margin is 76%, which is similar to other high growth darling tech companies like CRWD and NET.

I think Unity is priced to perfection right now. I could see it slide in the high 70's due to greater market forces clobbering growth right now, where it has a current P/S of 25 and a future P/S of 17. But right now, if you're willing to hold for 1+ years, this earnings report is great.

Also, like OP pointed out, Unity is expanding its use cases. They're moving beyond gaming and focusing on virtual worlds to augment modern enterprise solutions. This is something that NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang talked about during his NVIDIA Key Note that he called ""Digital Twins"". I think this market place is nascent and has far reaching capabilities. If Unity goes in this direction, they could easily become a market leader in a new market of virtual reality training and architecture.

tldr. Unity's been beaten down enough that these numbers may provide confidence in entering Unity at this price point. We may see aggregate market forces push down the price of Unity further, but compared to other high flying growth tech stocks (ie. NET and CRWD), Unity seems to have better fundamentals currently.",['NVDA']

nar0j4,,stocks,post,1620832289,"Confused about Wash RulesI just started investing with Fidelity and I have been pretty active.  I also have some minor OCD so I have made some decisions that I have undone relatively quickly.  

I bought a number of stocks and ETFs that I regretted a few days later and sold to eventually move into broad market indexes.  After a few days, I even sold most of my shares in the broad index to just wait and see what happens with inflation.

I'm concerned that most of my sales has a small percentage that is a 'Wash Sale'.  I understand what a Wash Sale is, but I don't see how that applies to all of these stocks that I bought and then resold a few days later.  I know it occurs when you sell a holding for a loss and then buy a similar one within 30 days, but I don't think I did any of that.  I never rebought any of these stocks.

Would I get a Wash Sale because I sold a stock for a loss then purchased a broad market index?

Also - I sold most of my shares in ITOT today for a loss because, and I have a few hundred that is listed as a Wash Sale (positive).  Is this because I had purchased the initial stock within 30 days prior?  If that is the case, how is it possible to day trade if you are penalized for selling a stock for a loss that you bought within the past 30 days?  I'm a new investor and confused.",

The wash sale loss exclusion does apply to stock losses that you still hold stock in that you purchased within 30 days prior and 30 days after the sale considered an wash sale excluded loss.

In other words, you'll have to entirely get out of the stock and remain out for over 30 days to have a loss that can be deducted.",

Starting pay for hourly crew members will range from $11 to $18 an hour. There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.

Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he's seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.

As the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it's raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.

The company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.

The pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.

Chipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.

n9x0wl,,stocks,post,1620739741,"Some Advice for Newer Investors from an Experienced Investor (5+Years)Just thought I would drop a few suggestions in here as having invested for over 5 years I have found ways that have stopped me pulling my hair out during ""turbulent"" times such as these and hopefully can have some words of wisdom for newer investors:

1. Close the app, don't keep checking it every 5 mins or you will be impulsive and emotive in your choices. As humans we tend to follow the sunken cost fallacy and often can't comprehend these losses are only on paper.
2. Re-evaluate, if you are just trying to break even that is not good enough you need to have confidence this company's product will continue being innovative or respected and if you sell now you are essentially saying I do not think the pricepoint will ever be greater than it currently is (although if you see another opportunity that you think have a better future make sure to consider this more in depth). I sold PLTR because I honestly don't think it will break $20 in the foreseeable future and bought it off hype, I took a loss but it gave me the liquidity to pivot elsewhere.
3. WWW - What went wrong, work out the weak points of your portfolio and what can you do better, for me I had gone over my risk tolerance in order to chase gains. I needed to pullback a sec and diversify into stocks like Tupper and Crocs which were undervalued and had low P/E's rather than sticking to tech and the ""hot stocks"". If you have knowledge of what went wrong you won't start getting unjustly angry because of not understanding the losses and just seeing your savings slip away.
4. Remember that stock losses are temporary, I have had some dark days last few weeks but just getting outside and getting some fresh air has done me wonders, the whole market is down so don't beat yourself up over any mistakes, you only really need to worry if it is only your stocks dropping and there is no indication from the wider market.
5. Always remember ""Mr Market"" [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp) he is irrational, he is crazy but he can be your best friend. Logically it can appear good earnings may mean a raise in Stock Price but the market is always forward looking, if they can't guarantee future earnings or guidance it will go down, there is always a twist to the logic.
6. This is more for the more experienced investors but:  don't gloat and mock the newer investors, they are at least trying to do something new - the current system really screws over us younger people and I tip my hat to anyone trying anything different. I can only speak for myself but the investing culture didn't run through my family so I'm entirely self taught and I made a lot of mistakes. Don't beat them while they are down remember: we all had to start at one point.

Final PSA: The Stock Market is not for everyone, there is no shame in investing into an ETF or Bonds if life is in the way - I believe every investor has some element of fun when it comes to stocks in order to stay invested in the market. If it is never fun and is just an extra chore than it is probably not for you and you should have a more passive strategy.

This is not always true. If you are in the broader market, yes, it will in all likelihood recover. If you are in individual names, nope, no guarantee. 

If you bought General Motors in 1980, that stock is worth nothing today. Nothing. It went bankrupt. Sure, you pulled out some dividends, but the principal is toast. Buying GM in 1980 was sound, sage advice. 

If you bought Intel in the summer of 2000 when it was the darling you are still down. JDSU bagholders are out a lot as well. I cannot state how much people loved JDSU back in the day. 

I personally went ballz deep in Citigroup, AIG and Lehman when they were falling knives. LEH is gone and C and AIG did reverse splits and are worth maybe 20% of what I paid for them in 2007 or 2008. 

Moral of the story, if you are in individual names, watch them like a freaking hawk because some of those losses, even in ""great names"" will never come back.

47 billion usd net income, including one-time gain from selling sprint etc.

200 to 236 billion usd increase in NAV (including debts) over 12 months

Breakdown of net asset value: 47% BABA, 25% SVF1+2, 32% other

269 billion usd equity value of holdings, 34 billion usd net debt, 12% loan to value (25% expected in normal times)

12 months ago they announced 2.5 trillion jpy on share repurchases, and 4.5 trillion jpy monetization strategy. Ended up doing 10 trillion jpy in monetizing [includes pending Arm deal], today 2.5 trillion jpy share buyback was completed, and will be retired from treasury.

2.7k jpy EPS in last year [TSE shares, not OTC], NAV is 15k jpy/share, 9.3k jpy/share [actual price]; 3.3 P/E, so it's still undervalued on paper.

1 year ago SVF -1.116 billion jpy quarterly loss, last quarter 3.590 billion jpy quarterly income from svf. Last 12 months 6.358 trillion jpy gain from SVF.

Of the companies that have gone public from the portfolios; SVF1 originally invested 15.7 billion usd, not worth 60.4; SVF2 invested 1.6 billion usd, now worth 6.2 billion.

SVF1: 60% of gain in value went to Softbank Group, because 40% of equity is outside investors with preferred shares and fixed return. SBG had 39% return on net equity annualized (IRR). SVF2: was all SBG capital, 30 billion usd used, 119% IRR. Latam Fund: 2.6 billion usd invested, now 4.0 billion fair value, net equity IRR 62%. 244 total investments across all 3 including deals pending closings.

Companies fluffed: Nvidia, Gopuff, Better, Jellysmack, Trax, Jobandtalent

Important notes from Q&A:

No change in strategy with BABA, so probably mostly holding as Masa sees no fundamental changes in it as a business and it makes plenty of money. Notes that Mapbox deal with SVF unmentionable company is not announced yet (didn't comment on it specifically) but saw no problem with Softbank unmentionable companies merging with SVF portfolio companies. No expectation of doing more share buybacks, implies he would allow share price to fall further below book value of assets and focus on investing. Wants to focus on systemic approach to investing to exiting companies and create more regular pipeline so more steady revenue going forward. Says SVF2 money can be recycled easily and a 3rd party investor is not necessary, happy with amount of capital available. Downplays worries about risks of technology regulation, says he is focused on unicorns not megacaps.

nagvmw,,stocks,post,1620795676,"Is there actually any real connection between a company’s market cap and its financials!Hi yall I’ve wondered this for a while. But is there actually any real connection between a companies market cap and its financials? Like there is idea that you want to invest in good companies with good ratios and balance sheets but does that stuff actually have any direct impact on what a companies market cap would be? Because I can’t think of any besides If the balance sheets show it might go bankrupt, or that if you care about dividends and want a positive eps. But it’s pretty obvious to see if a company might go bankrupt, and even when it does it doesn’t always mean a low market cap (gme case and point). And most people investing don’t really care about dividends. Can y’all educate me on this thank you 😂",
nagvmw,gxtkjeq,stocks,comment,1620796548,"Depends on what companies your looking at. 2020 was a unique year. Multiples for mature industries look pretty normal if you use projected performance.

If you're looking at 2020 or LTM 2021, multiples are going to be crazy. 

Dividends tell you a story. But not the story that most of the traders on here understand. High dividends means low growth and potentially unsustainable payouts (look at $T's dividend. The stock price doesn't think it'll last in perpetuity). No yield can tell a story of growth or financial stress. 

Anyways, young an investor should be indifferent between capital gains and dividends. But you should be aware as to what the dividend is telling you.

So, this shouldn't be taken as financial advice, but my personal suggestion would be to move most, if not all, your stuff to VTI (or VTI/VXUS for the international exposure, or VT if you really want to simplify things to the ultimate extreme), build that up, and then if you want to get back into a bit of stock picking keep it to less than 10% of your total portfolio.",

1. Oil is still VERY necessary in our economy. Yes renewables are the future, however the timeline is still 5+ years. The world needs oil for the foreseeable future, and ESPECIALLY in order to make this massive transition to renewables.
2. People are dying to travel and go on vacations. This is assuming COVID ends by mid summer for North America, but the amount of travel by the end of this year is going to be insane. 
3. Oil supply. Well, what's left of it. The oil majors have been burned one too many times. Most probably aren't going to push a lot into capital spending to raise production levels because why would they? They know their commodity isn't the future, so why pour more money into it? They can still reap the benefits of higher revenue simply by cutting back supply. 
4. OPEC. This one is speculative, but I think OPEC has finally realized working together to corner the supply into the market is better than fighting for lowest dollar. Saudi caught everybody off guard a couple months back when they cut production by 1M bb/d, which I don't think they've ever done. Moving forward, I do honestly believe they will work together to ensure higher oil price by cornering supply, but once again its speculative. Maybe not Russia, but nobody likes them. 

Everybody loves to hate oil, but its a necessary evil for the mid term future, and unless that is recognized we are going to wind up in a supply crunch pretty soon.",

But let's view it from another point. And let's ignore investing more over time to make my argument very simple, but I should point out this would be WAY higher if you e.g. added 500 a month.


If you are young and invest for 25 years on constant 10% gains (this is not reality but somewhat close) and then you are young and invest for 30 years for constant 10% gains.


On 25 years that ends in 108k. 

On 30 years that ends in 174k.


See the enormous difference? It's not just a tiny bit thats lost and it's on such a small amount (small compared to what most should be able to with investing more and more).


To show how extreme this gets with investing more I will add 6k for 2 more years (500 a month) and add 10% to the year 1 investment, so that's 6600. The initial 10k is now 10000+10%=11000, 11000+10%=12100. Total of 24700 (6000+6600+12100) after 2 years are over and 2700 of returns.


This time 2 years passed so we use 23 years and 28 years with 10% a year.


On 23 years, it's now 221k vs 108k previously.

On 28 years, it's now 356k vs 174k previously.


And again these numbers are only for investing continuously for 2 years, not the entire time. 


Of course you can gamble and hope to hit a very big one, kick start a huge investment and also not lose it, but I guess you should question if you actually need that.",

nabmln,,stocks,post,1620778036,"Auto stocks seem to be riding too high on the EV hypeI feel like Tesla sunk it's teeth into a niche market of luxury electric cars that appear futury. But the allure of having a Tesla in my opinion is that they are different and unique, not necessarily that they are electric. They are like the Macbooks of cars.

Now I get creating an affordable electric car, and marketing it as a cost saver in gas and maintenance, but I believe trying to compete with Tesla in their little market of cyberpunk LARPERs is suicide. As an example... Ford just announced an electric f-150. As far as I know, there are two kinds of people who own f-150's: 

1) Blue collar workers who's only consideration in buying a truck is that it does the job for as cheaply as possible, they could care less if it's with a gas or electric truck.

2) People who want to compensate for their fragile masculinity by driving the biggest, most noisy, gas guzzling, obnoxious atmosphere killing vehicle they can get their hands on. In which case, electric might be a negative if anything. 

GM seems to be throwing all of their eggs into the electric vehicle hype. They are planning on transition all their vehicles to electric by 2035.

Now, one thing I understand about the auto industry is that it's a nightmare of a business to be in and the margins are terrifyingly slim. Macro economic variables can still punish them severely even if they do everything right. If they make a mistake? Like overestimating the market for expensive electric vehicles and spending a fortune on creating the capabilities to manufacture them? I mean it's not even really outside the realm of possibilities that they go bankrupt over something like that. 

I'm not bearish on auto companies, I just don't see anyone talking about the risk, they seem to jump every time they announce an EV. EV's have a lot of potential, but I don't see a huge demand for them. The vast majority of people, as you can see by how tightly car sales correlate with macroeconomic trends, seem to just think of cost when they buy a car, they just buy whatever is the best deal they can find. The rest who buy luxury vehicles seem to think of them as a fashion statement. I don't think either care about fuel source.","['TSLA', 'GM']"

GE I’ve lost $150.

Gold was positive, but now it’s lost me $50 too.

Almost bought into some REITs, but every single one I looked at is going down.

Every stock on my list is negative except Vaxart, which seems ironic cause everything else on my list is supposedly safer stocks like materials and utilities and real estate. Tangible assets. All negative.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

na1u4o,,stocks,post,1620752592,"Nautilus Inc: Exposure to Connected Fitness at 7x earningsNautilus is a leading global producer of home fitness equipment known for its Bowflex and Schwinn brands of connected fitness bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and strength training equipment. The company is the 3rd largest player (by a large margin) in the fragmented connected fitness industry. The business, led by a new CEO, has executed on a transformational turnaround in its business model. It has shifted away from being a cyclical fitness equipment maker and towards becoming a high margin, subscription-oriented connected fitness company. The redesigned products have been selling extremely well, and the connected fitness subscription numbers are growing at triple digits (albeit from a small base). 

The company is valued at less than 1x sales, 7x earnings, and has 20% of its market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. The stock trades at over a 75% discount compared to public and private peers including Peloton, NordicTrack, Tonal, Tempo, and more.

Q1 numbers reported yesterday afternoon.

Excellent numbers and forward guidance confirms my viewpoint that the company has transformed its business, and at-home fitness is not going anywhere.  


I am also hopeful that they can capitalize on the fact that their treadmills aren't killing children and injuring adults (referencing the mess Peloton has found itself in).

  
**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights:**  


* $206.1 million revenue (+121% YoY) 
   * \+143.3% YoY excluding divested Octane Fitness commercial business (sold last October)
   * Blew past Q1 guidance of $145 million to $165 million (+55% to 75% YoY)
   * highest quarterly sales in 35-year company history
* $30.4 million net income (vs. $2.2 million Q1 2020)  

* $0.93 earnings per share (vs. $0.07 EPS Q1 2020). beat estimates by over 100%
* $100 million net cash on balance sheet (vs. $500 million market cap)
* 6x to 8x P/E
* $179 million in order backlogs at the end of March

**Apr-June 2021 Quarter Forward Guidance**  


* \+40% to +50% YoY sales growth (+51% to +62% excluding Octane Fitness), \~$170 million in revenue
* 250,000 JRNY subscribers by March 2022
* $12 million to $14 million annual CAPEX with majority earmarked for JRNY subscription service 

Blowout quarter that was even stronger than Q4 2020, which I believe most people suspected would be peak earnings for many ""pandemic winners.""  


The business itself has continued to perform extremely well. The majority of market participants have been extremely skeptical as to whether Nautilus was a one-hit pandemic winner. In contrast, all of my research indicated that at-home fitness was here to permanently stay for a large part of the population. Nautilus had also permanently transformed their product portfolio and business model (JRNY connected fitness service) to capture this growth in the market.

  
Q2 2021 is the first true ""pandemic YoY comp"" to gauge how the business will perform in a more normal world. The fact that Nautilus has guided to 40% to 50% YoY growth (and even higher excluding divested commercial business) means the company's ability to grow in the post-pandemic world is becoming clearly evident. The order backlog of $179 million (at the end of a $206 million sales quarter) is also indicative of this.

  
Margins and profitability will definitely be pressured for the next 1 to 2 quarters due to higher commodity prices, global chip shortages, and increased marketing and investment in JRNY. However, I don't see a particularly difficult path for them to hit $2.50 to $3.00 in EPS this year, which means the stock currently trades at around 6x to 8x earnings. 

  
This is quite cheap, especially considering that net cash is 20% of market cap, and the company is in the process of complementing its equipment business with predictable, high margin software revenue from the JRNY connected fitness subscription.

  
I have been frustrated that the market was not giving this company much credit over the last 9 months. But as they keep executing quarters like this, there's no way the stock can stay down here in a single digit P/E.",

nabswt,gxsv91m,stocks,comment,1620782274,"Firstly, the stock isn't tanking. Tanking is 50%+ losses. Go look at SPCE, ENPH, MAXN, TTD, LMND. That's tanking.

Also, AVNW is only down 25% from its peak in April, while the entire tech industry and growth is down. Also, its basically at its February heights, which means the stock is well positioned.

Okay, lets look at financials. Their margin is 38% with 8% YoY growth. They were priced at $10 in October and are $30 now.

Also their revenue for the year is targeted for $265M for the year and their market cap is $331M. Their P/S is 1.1. Since their revenue growth is only 8% YoY, with 38% margins, I don't see their stock price going far beyond $40 without good PR or projections to expand into  broader markets.

Slide 13 of their investor presentation says there is a growth opportunity in rural broadband. And slide 7 says they have 6% of their TAM of $3B, and that the 5G growth market is 24% CAGR to increase  1.5B by itself.

https://investors.aviatnetworks.com/static-files/35c3c9af-aa0d-42bf-bf3c-d9c04cafcbb6

With all this, AVNW may have a stock that could reach $50 or $60 if they can increase their revenue growth rates. But at 8% growth, they're not going to see super high stock prices without greater growth. But a 1 P/S ratio is really really low. But the industry for microwave transmission (ie. ERIC, CRNT, etc) all have P/S ratios of ~1. Don't expect to rely on a high P/S ratio to drive up this stock price.

$30 seems priced to perfection.",['ENPH']
nabswt,gxssvmp,stocks,comment,1620781060,"I'll be told I don't know what I'm talking about, but here goes.

It was being shorted from its high of $41 after it split. On May 12th, it bottomed at $28, below the support that was in the mid to low $30s but there were no stop-losses to trigger after the split.  I assume from the lack of volume at that level that a split cancels stop losses.

The short seller was going for a double bottom to pick up some new buyers with stop-losses and they couldn't beat the earnings report. At that point, an increase in price would have hurt the short seller so they shorted way down to discourage buyers who might be encouraged by the report.

If they didn't cover today with the panic selling, they will probably give up. I'd buy in if I hadn't overspent my budget today, averaging down on my favorite companies.

I always look at stock movement as if someone were planning to take my money away from me. It keeps me on my toes and aids in predicting prices. In fact, panic selling looks like a manipulation, except at the very bottom.",

From my understanding inflation is a big concern with investors right now. People are worried this crazy inflation will not be transient, as insisted by the fed,  but instead will persist and force the fed to raise rates. But hasn’t the market already priced that in by now? Many many speculative/growth stocks have crashed over the past few months. High flyers like pltr, nio, QS, and arkk are 50-100% down from their recent highs. From my understanding cash flow 5 years out would be discounted by ~5% with a 1% increase in rates, but obviously we’re far past 5-10% drops. 

So then…

If interest rates really do start rising and Powell really does stop printing, how much worse can things get in the sectors that have already corrected? Is the raise in rates primarily going to affect the less speculative parts of the market if it comes? Growth companies are expected to trade at a premium to reflect some of their future earnings growth, are we still trading far above their fair value right now?

Tesla delivered a record number of cars out of it's Shanghai Factory in April.

They delivered over 40,000 cars in April and are continuing to increase their production ramp.

Fremont delivered over 100,000 cars in Q1 and they did not produce any Model S or Model X vehicles due to parts shortages. They are set to begin deliveries for the Model S in Q2 so their production out of Fremont should be higher than Q1 and with Tesla now producing over 40k a month in Shanghai they could conservatively at this pace reach north of 225k in Q2. They might be significantly higher than 225 with them already at 40k out of Shanghai the first month of the quarter.

Estimates seem to be in the 195-205k range.




Edit: Seems the information was misinterpreted and the actual numbers were about 25k out of Shanghai in April. The factory had shutdowns for 2 weeks. I still think this is bullish that they were able to pump out 25k in the month of April with factory shut downs for 2 weeks. They should clear 100k easily in the quarter out of Shanghai and 100k easily out of Fremont. Estimate for the quarter now 210k and potentially more depending on how much they can ramp Shanghai in May and June.

nao0oo,,investing,post,1620824203,"Inflation surges in April as consumer prices leap 4.2%, fastest since 2008Inflation accelerated at its fastest pace in more than 12 years for April as the U.S. economic recovery kicked into gear and energy prices jumped higher, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.

The Consumer Price Index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 3% from the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%.

The increase in the headline CPI rate was the fastest since September 2008.

Energy prices overall jumped 25% from a year ago, including a 49.6% increase for gasoline and 37.3% for fuel oil. That came even though most energy categories saw a decline in April.

Prices at the pump, which fell 1.4% in April, have resumed their climb in May, with the national average eclipsing $3 a gallon for the first time since November 2014, according to AAA.

Used car and truck prices, which are seen as a key inflation indicator, surged 21%, including a 10% increase in April alone. Shelter, another key CPI component, was up 2.1% year over year and 0.4% for the month.

In addition to rising prices, one of the main reasons for the big annual gain was because of base effects, meaning inflation was very low at this time in 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic caused a widespread shutdown of the U.S. economy. Year-over-year comparisons are going to be distorted for a few months because of the pandemic’s impact.

For that reason, Federal Reserve policymakers and many economists are dismissing the current round of numbers as transitory, with the expectation that inflation settles down later this year around the 2% range targeted by the central bank.

Stock market futures briefly reached session lows after the release of the CPI numbers and pointed to a negative open on Wall Street. Government bond yields were mostly higher.

Price surges also have come amid supply bottlenecks caused by a number of factors, from production issues with the ubiquitous semiconductors found in electronics products to the Suez Canal blockage in March to soaring demand for a variety of commodities.

Lumber prices alone have risen 124% in 2021 amid persistent demand for building materials. Copper, often seen as a proxy for economic activity, has jumped nearly 36%.

Still, Fed officials repeatedly have said they will not raise interest rates or pull back on monthly bond purchases until inflation averages around 2% over an extended period.

nao0oo,gxukxae,investing,comment,1620824996,"I was trying to get a post going on this, but the automoderator blocked me. Thanks for doing this. Just pasting below what I was planning to write.

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)

**Some Context & Data**

* The index for used cars and trucks rose 10.0 percent in April. This was the largest 1-month increase since the series began in 1953
* Largest monthly increase in core CPI (seasonally adjusted) since Apr '82. That's 1982.
* Food inflation saw a significant increase this month after doing not much last month
* Annualized, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 4.2 percent over the last 12 months to an index level of 267.054
* There is a good graphic I saw on Twitter showing the trend changes of the data here. [See that here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1MJKCNVgAE-x_0?format=png&name=large).

**Keep in Mind, a LOT of this is Wild Base Effects**

Financial media and markets are going to be getting their panties in a bunch over this despite the fact that this was obvious.

[I wrote a post on this here a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m1ynqd/the_cpi_report_didnt_just_reduce_fears_of/gqgy30m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and it still applies. Note that the post is literally only taking the base effects into consideration here when doing the math, so it's not a surprise this came in higher given that we are also facing reopening (to a degree), continuing fiscal, and some supply shocks on top of that all.

While base effects are the major driver here, that doesn't mean there isn't significant real inflation on top of that right now. The crux of the matter is supply constraints that have worked their way through the system as a result of over a year of dealing with Covid. On top of that, there are other trends such as deglobalization, one-off issues like a containership getting stuck in the Suez canal, etc etc.

The base effects for CPI will continue to be even higher next month, so don't lose your mind like everyone else when we post another even higher number next month.The silver lining is that base effects moderate after June, so starting in July, we will likely see this get at least a little bit more under control. That being said, a lot depends on policy, whether some of these supply bottlenecks can be worked out, and whether cost increases will be self-correcting by slowing demand.",['TWTR']

nabnrv,,investing,post,1620778132,"Cathie Wood: Deep Dive Into Her 20+ Year Performance HistoryHow could an equity manager that has been in the game for over 30 years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with Ark? What was she doing before Ark? I have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below.

&nbsp;

**Quick summary**

-   She has a long history of running funds that fit under ""discovery growth"" or ""global thematic"" styles.

-   Cathie has a **great track record outperforming the S&P 500**, but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style. Also, this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance.

-   When compared to category style, almost all of Cathie's major **outperforming** years come during special periods in the market cycle, particularly in the periods following a market crash. With one other period of great performance during the 2017 BTC bubble craze**.**

-   Outside of those special events, Cathie's funds generally **underperform** equivalent style peers on a year-by-year basis.

-   She has a history of **leaving a fund during or** **following a period of underperformance**, then ""rebooting"" in another fund. This includes a short stint in **a hedge fund that lost over 80% of it's AUM**.

&nbsp;

Before getting into the deep dive, a quick note on benchmarks. Cathie's investment style fits into one of two flavors: **US growth** and **global growth**. The S&P 500 is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth-oriented or global oriented fund. Instead, for the years available, I will benchmark her to the Russell 1000 Growth and MSCI World Large Cap Index, as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund.

Additionally, I'm going to compare her performance to some matching T Rowe Price Funds. Why T Rowe Price? First, their security selection universe is similar to Cathie Woods: they tend to prefer growth-oriented companies (i.e. think Amazon rather than Phillip Morris). Secondary, they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices I will be using.

Finally, for another reference point I will benchmark against Yahoo Finance's category averages for years where no index data is easily available. 

&nbsp;

In Summary:

-   To benchmark her ""discovery growth"" funds, I am going to use the **i-shares Russell 1000 Growth Index (IWF)** (subject to years available) as well as **T Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund (PRNHX).**

-   To benchmark her ""global "" fund, I am going to use **Vanguard Total World (VT)** (subject to years available) and **T Rowe Price's Global Stock Fund (PRGSX)**.

-   For years where no index data is easily available, I will instead use Yahoo Finance's category averages (average of of active fund performance, after fees).

&nbsp;

**1980-1998 (Jennison Associates)**

This is the one period for which I could not find any performance data, as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period. She was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist. I tried looking up fund history on the SEC website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager, even after searching shareholder reports for the period. It's possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around...so unfortunately we need to skip this period.

&nbsp;

**1998-2001 (Tupelo Capital Services)**

Cathie co-founded this hedge fund in 1998..right as the dotcom bubble was building steam. ARK's company profile boasts that she managed $800 million in assets in 2000. Interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble. In 2001, as the market bubble crashes, Cathie leaves Tupelo Capital.

Unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund, but I have found AUM filings from the SEC.

In Q4 1999, the fund's AUM reached $1.0 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-001292/>)

In Q1 2000, the fund's AUM then reached $1.3 billion.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-00-005389/>)

By Q4 2000, the AUM shrank to ~$800 million: matching Cathie's stated figures.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-001535/>)

Finally, by the end of Q1 2001, the AUM shrank to ~$200 million.

Source (<https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-01-502496/>)

In other words**, the fund's AUM shrank roughly 80% over 2000 and 2001**. Note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out, so it's not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses.

By comparison, T Rowe's Global Equity Fund lost 17% across 2000-2001, roughly in line with the category average. Unfortunately Vanguard's Total World index (VT) did not exist during this timeframe.

&nbsp;

**2001-2013 (Alliance Bernstein)**

After Cathie left Tupelo Capital Services, she joined Alliance Bernstein. During her tenure she managed three funds that I could find:

-   AB Discovery Growth (**CHCIX**): A discovery/growth oriented fund.

-   AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund (**ALTFX**)

-   AB Strategy Research Portfolio: Note that this is a Separately Managed Account (SMA) not an open mutual fund. I will use the acronym **ABSRP**.

**2014-2020: Ark Years**

For the Ark era, I am going to use ARKK to evaluate her performance. I'm using ARKK because first and foremost it is her flagship fund, and secondly because her specialty funds, while interesting, are nearly impossible to benchmark against. For another comparison, I am also going to add another passive fund to the mix, Vanguard's VGT (Technology Index), in addition to the Russell 1000 Growth.

&nbsp;

**2014: N/A**

There is no full-year history for ARKK in 2014.

&nbsp;

**2015: Cathie UNDERPERFORMS T Rowe, UNDERPERFORMS Passive**

Benchmarks I am using for ARKK are IWF (IShares Russell Growth 2000) and VGT (Vanguard Technology ETF) as a secondary benchmark. It turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform. 

-   **ARKK**: 3.76%

-   VGT: 5.02%

Summary: This is without a doubt the breakout year for Cathie Wood. How was this done? Can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance? Hint - it wasn't an equity holding. A position in Bitcoin Investment Trust is by far her top contributor, netting her 635, 748, 655 basis points of compounding outperformance in Q2, Q3, and Q4. Check out their quarterly reports and you'll see it's not even close. Note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of 1.0635 * 1.0748 * 1.065..because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets. In other words..I estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about 57%. Still great, but brings it down a bit more towards earth.

Q1 Return: 19.2%

Q2 Return 20.9% (14.55 without BTC)

Q3 Return 18.3% (10.82 without BTC)

Q4 Estimated Return 9.9% (3.35 without BTC)

**56.3% return without BTC (estimated)**

2020 bears no explanation. We all lived through the fun in the market last year. In case it isn't obvious, her biggest contributor for the year was Tesla, however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of 2017.

**My take on ARK**

The following comes directly from ARK's own FAQ:\
""ARK's funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash. ARK generally will not use cash in a tactical manner.""

<https://ark-funds.com/help-center/what-is-the-typical-range-for-the-cash-position>

Let me explain in layman speak what this means. Here the algorithm Cathie follows to buy or sell:

-   When Cathie receives inflows, she buys

-   When Cathie receives outflows, she sells

Sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund. You see, unlike most active funds...Cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows..even as she now sits with many billion AUM, and continuing to pump money into existing positions.

Unlike Cathie, **top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing** ***too*** **well**. The exception to this are mega-cap blue chip funds, but Cathie is not running a mega-cap blue chip fund. The T Rowe Funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows. Fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid-cap funds. Let me quickly summarize what IMO are some of the best virtues of a good active manager:

-   Keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk/reward tradeoff.

-   Sell if the risk/reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients, even if this means selling to a cash position.

-   If your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well..you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short-minded performance chasers.

-   If there is a great buying opportunity (i.e. a market crash) and your fund is closed, you should open your fund to solicit new inflows.

-   You should try to keep your Assets Under Management (AUM) small if possible. The larger your AUM, the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap. Let's say for example you wanted to bet 5% of your portfolio on San Jose Water Company (SJW), an infrastructure holding of mine. Well...their total market cap is less then $2 billion. If your AUM was $100 billion, you'd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio.

-   Your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise. Telling your clients ""your goal is to beat the S&P 500 on a risk adjusted basis"" is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved.

I do not see Cathie following any of the above. Instead I am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors:

-   Actively soliciting more inflows even when total AUM across Ark funds exceeded $50 billion. This is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions.

-   Advertising that ARKK should double your investment in 5 years.

-   Regularly putting out videos, promotional materials, interviews, etc. promoting the house holdings with price targest significantly above most industry targets.

I do not believe Cathie is acting in her investors best interests. Intentionally or not, I believe Ark is essentially a pump scheme:

-   Buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth.

-   Promote the companies heavily: sell investors on the story.

-   Solicit inflows, use to buy more into those positions...sometimes owning up to 10% of the company. My theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies...

-   Sit back and **watch the stock's price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth**. This is not sustainable.

-   Until...well until what? You now hold a basket of companies trading at very high P/S ratios. Some of them might become the next Google, but surely they all won't become the next Google. You can try selling them to some greater fool, but good luck doing that with 10s of billions in AUM.

&nbsp;

Edit: lots of posts about how ARK cannot control inflows because it's an ETF. This is true and not Cathie's fault, but nonetheless it's a problem...or at least it's fair to say it's a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated ETFs. ARK is now suffering from the big AUM problem. Too much capital to chase after too few opportunities, victim of its own success.

n9zazb,,investing,post,1620746022,"Stanley Druckenmiller says the Fed is endangering the dollar’s global reserve status* Fed policies could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC.
* “I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” the chair and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said.
* Though he agreed with the early steps the Fed took during the pandemic, he said the policies have continued for too long.

Federal Reserve policies aimed at keeping markets and the economy afloat during the pandemic could end up threatening the long-term health of the U.S. dollar, investing magnate Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC on Tuesday.

The chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office said the Fed’s insistence on holding interest rates down and buying trillions in bonds even though markets are thriving and the economy is booming is a long-term risk.

“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said during a”Squawk Box” interview.

Though he does not take issue with the Fed’s initial actions to combat the pandemic-related threats, Druckenmiller said the central bank has kept its foot on the accelerator too long.

He asserted that the Fed has continued its policies to help underwrite the spending binge in Congress, which has allocated more than $5 trillion in stimulus and is contemplating trillions more in infrastructure-related spending.

Over the long haul, he said, the policies and the heavy debts and deficits they support will threaten the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency. That status means the dollar is accepted for transactions and as a store of wealth anywhere and is widely held by central banks around the world.

“If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it,” Druckenmiller said.

“If we’re going to monetize our debt and we’re going to enable more and more of this spending, that’s why I’m worried now for the first time that within 15 years we lose reserve currency status and of course all the unbelievable benefits that have accrued with it,” he added.

To be sure, others have warned in the past that Fed excesses could threaten the dollar, but the greenback has retained its position in the world.

One reason for that is there have been no other viable alternatives introduced.

Druckemiller has entertained the thought that a challenge could come from the crypto world. He said in the CNBC interview that the ultimate solution could be “some kind of ledger system invented by some kids from MIT or Stanford” though he conceded that “I don’t know what it will be.”

However, he noted that in the early days of the pandemic, other foreign governments already voiced their concerns about the dollar by selling Treasurys, the opposite of what normally would happen in a crisis when ultra-safe U.S. debt is generally seen as a haven.

Indeed, foreign holdings of government bills, notes and bonds actually have decreased, falling by $127 billion or nearly 2% over the past year, according to Treasury Department data. Foreigners hold nearly one-third of the public portion of the $28.2 trillion U.S. debt.

Druckenmiller said central banks have been the root of a lack of confidence in dollar stability.

“The problem has been clearly identified. It’s [Fed Chair[ Jerome Powell and the rest of the world’s central bankers,” he said. “There’s a lack of trust.”

Druckenmiller’s comments came a day after he and Duquesne partner Christian Broda said in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that Powell “needs to recognize the likelihood of future political pressures on the Fed and stop enabling financial and market excesses.”

Similarly, former New York Fed President William Dudley wrote in Bloomberg News that markets are underestimating how much the central bank will have to raise interest rates in the years ahead to keep up with the inflation it is trying to foster.

The Fed itself, in its semiannual Financial Stability Report last week, said it worried about risks coming from soaring asset prices.

Druckenmiller told CNBC he has “no doubt whatsoever that we are in a raging mania in all assets.”

nash4a,,investing,post,1620835947,"I was bored and thinking about Ark funds. So I decided to do a breakdown to see how much of each fund is represented within ARKK. Figured I'd share if anyone else was interested.Hi all, 

I was thinking about Ark funds and wasn't sure if I wanted to split it up between all of the individual funds or just keep it simple and go with ARKK. I wanted to know if ARKK was a decent representation of all of the individual funds. Kind of like if it was ""an ETF of all Ark funds"".

So I brought in all of the holdings into excel and conditional formatted for overlapping holdings. I then summed up the weighting from the ARKK fund to see how much of ARKK is comprised of holdings from each fund. Below are the results. 

ARKK shares X% holdings with X fund:

ARKQ: 24.59%

ARKW: 72.20%

ARKG: 30.63%

ARKF: 35.40%

ARKX: 6.53%

PRNT: 3.43%

IZRL: 1.4%

Obviously there's a lot of overlap so these numbers are going to add up to over 100%. 

But I was very surprised to see that ARKK is 72% similar to ARKW. Also surprised to see it's only 6.53% similar to ARKX, but that makes sense given it's the newest one. 

Anyway thought this was a fun exercise and figured I'd share if anyone else were interested. 

Long story short is ARKK is actually a pretty good sum of all of the other funds. If you want to keep it simple, just go with ARKK.",['ARKK']

Direct buyers took 17.1% of the issued bonds versus six month average at 16.4%

Indirects (generally foreign investors) took 63.4% of the issued bonds versus the 59.4% six month average.

They hurt me when they cut the dividend but I think they have the most potential to jump when the Fed removes the asset cap and they restore the dividend.  I hope I'm not wrong and it ends up as a ""sell the news"" thing.  I'm thinking that may happen in June.  

I think HMC looks good on paper,  but I'm not sure how well they are handling the chip shortage.   I bought TM instead because they reported that it wasn't impacting them and they really do everything well.

I understand that chip shortages mean that this year Sony will be to sell only a limited number of PS5. Also, FY2020 earnings increase of +15% were driven by pandemic but still is it that this year we could expect at least FY2019 earnings, which would make it to PE 13.22 with the PS5 potential to sell in 2022 at 100M+ copies if they fix a supply chain. Other segments of the company seems to doing just fine.

Or if the ticker is in the process of transferring to another posting or something worse. I can't seem to find any news on either UZB sites or USM.

najjey,gxuj08d,investing,comment,1620824005,"QE doesn't cause inflation, but it CAN enable inflation to run free by preventing bond yields from crashing the party.

QE on it's own is probably long-term disinflationary since it enables lower cost of capital which generally pushes more commodity supply into the market relative to unchanging demand.

Fiscal stimulus on the other hand is very inflationary. And even more inflationary than fiscal stimulus are supply shocks and constraints. Supply side inflation is more pernicious than demand-based inflation, although it usually tends to be more self-correcting.",
najjey,gxudc79,investing,comment,1620820746,"I have been reading about Soro's famous shorts of the pound sterling and the Thailand baht to create a couple of billion in very short order and I'm more concerned that what we see is the dollar getting relatively weaker.   The Asian financial crisis had qualitative easing and government bailing out their domestic industries when they stopped letting Baht be backed by the US dollar.  Soros also did this to the Yen, but at the same time he dropped a ton of money into the Nikkei because the assets were up relative to the Yen.  Sounds eerily similar to the US market now, but I am just getting started learning about all this so what do I know.  My takeaway is it is going to be even worse to hold cash in a period of nightmare inflation anyway including the resulting market crash resulting in the actual deflation of the currency.

I'm guessing the US economy is way less vulnerable to a move of a few billion to short the actual dollar because of its large size relative to South Asian and the Pound Sterling's reach as far as assassinating the currency goes.",

nadzhy,,investing,post,1620785496,"Billionaire Sam Zell Buys Gold With Inflation ‘Reminiscent of the ‘70s’https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/sam-zell-buys-gold-with-inflation-reminiscent-of-the-1970s

Billionaire investor Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge -- something he says he used to knock others for doing.

“Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It feels very funny because I’ve spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?”

Zell, 79, said he’s concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week.

“Oh boy, we’re seeing it all over the place,” Zell said of inflation. “You read about lumber prices, but we’re seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It’s very reminiscent of the ‘70s.”

While gold is an attractive investment, opportunities in fossil fuels are not, said Zell, who in 2019 agreed to set up a joint venture with Tom Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital Inc. to invest in oil and gas.

“Right now, oil and gas is not priced to reflect the risk of what’s going on, whether it be in the EV world, a climate changed world,” he said. “As recently as a couple of years ago I thought the risk-reward ratio was appropriate. It’s clearly become very inappropriate as our political situation has changed.”

Zell also said he’s concerned about renewable energy undermining the reliability of power grids, pointing to the recent blackouts in California and Texas.

In real estate, there are plenty of questions about what demand will look like over the next couple years in the office, lodging and retail sectors, Zell also said in the interview.

“Everybody’s worried about going back to work and office-space occupancy. I don’t think that’s really an issue,” he said. “The problem is that, before the pandemic, we were dealing with an oversupply of office space. Obviously the pandemic hasn’t reduced that oversupply and has probably encouraged it accordingly.”

Stores also present challenges, he said, given that the U.S. already had more retail space per person than the rest of the world before Covid-19, and shoppers increased their reliance on e-commerce while stuck at home during the pandemic.

“Street retail today is like a falling knife, and you don’t know how far it goes down,” he said. While that “doesn’t mean the best malls aren’t going to perform,” there’s a “huge amount of real estate that’s going to have to be reprogrammed in one form or another.”

The challenges faced by hotels are more of a temporary problem over the next three to four years, Zell said. “We will see a slow recovery in business travel,” he said. “In the interim period of time, it’s going to be a slow recovery, and hotels are big overhead things and running them at less-than-optimum occupancy is a very expensive scenario.”",

Literally the only problem with this stock, at least in my eyes, is their overwhelming float of shares - but I'm not sure if this or the market cap really matters, it's an extremely high-volume and liquid stock that will probably have ~40-50% solid gains annually (so long as we don't tank by mid-2022, which of course remains a possibility on the table at current valuations anyway).

narr02,,investing,post,1620834154,"Western Digital - The Next NvidiaAs the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups(usually to tape). Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new crypto, Chia, has gobbled up about 3.5 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, growing at a rate of about 0.2 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a week ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $30 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 40 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.25 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 48 days, plus the 3.5 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 15 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra 5% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.","['AMD', 'AMZN', 'WDC', 'NVDA', 'FB']"

So, does this really mean, for example, that if you have the $25K, you can literally buy $25K worth of a stock then sell it and a few minutes later do that exact same thing again with the full $25K and a few minutes later do it again over and over and over LITERALLY AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT??? Or is there something stopping a person from doing that even if they have and maintain over $25K in their account???? For some reason I can't help but find that a little bit hard to believe and can't quite find anywhere online if that is exactly how it works.

P.S. Also I read something about how if it falls under $25K, then you won't be able to trade.

n9snsw,gxpqg7e,investing,comment,1620730170,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are dropping this morning, with tech and small caps leading the way lower. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 already down 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. S&P 500 futures down 0.8%. Dow Industrials 0.6% lower. That’s as of 0635.

This follows another day of selling in tech. The Nasdaq was down 2.5% yesterday, its worst day since March. The index is now down 4% this month. Sell in May? Well, Dow Industrials are up 2.5% and the S&P is green as well (barely).

This begs two questions: 1. What’s causing the tech sell-off? 2. Is it a buying opportunity?

The former appears to be this ‘rotation trade’ into cyclicals (and staples). I suspect interest rate hikes are starting to be priced in as well. The latter I discuss on the audio.

So what gives? Is the idea that the market makers themselves will then crash the price of the illiquid shares they are holding after such a redemption?

na82fc,,investing,post,1620768033,"How will the business around selfdriving trucks may look?Everyone talks about electrification of cars, and that cool self driving feature, where you can sit back and watch a movie with your family. And yes, that's pretty neat. The car manufacturer have to change a big chunk of their product (but not all), batteries will take a big part and all around the world, the whole industry will shift. Some new players appear, some will grow and some will die. But I think this won't be a big market interruption (like the smartphone industry with apps and internet to-go), but more of a slower change.

But something I think might highly interrupt the market in a very short time, will be self driving trucks. And that's what I'd like to hear your opinion about.

The first thing that comes to mind is *yea cool, you don't need to pay a driver and spare $40,000 a year*. But that's too short sighted. You think a company who owns 10 trucks and 10 drivers now, suddenly will own 10 trucks and 0 drivers? I don't think so.

From my personal experience with trucking: The company I work for builds specialized machinery for our customers. When it's time for delivery, we have scheduled the amount of trucks we need (1-5), the time for pick up, delivery and location anywhere in europe (I'm from germany btw). We usually use the same trucking company, because they're close by and we've already established a business relationship with them. 

But this needs a lot of pre planing. If manufacturing is delayed, the delivery will be delayed, the trucking company needs to hold back truck & driver and so on.

With self driving trucks it doesn't matter. No driver to keep on hold. You don't need a trucking company 'close by', because there is no homebase for a self driving truck every few days. This might doesn't sound big, but it basically opens up the door for an Uber-like trucking company, availability like a taxi. You call and they come an hour later. This is convenience at it's best. It's something the bigger companys try to offer already, but its fucking expensive at the moment. You have to have free trucks and divers somewhere near at all times, to offer a service like that.

And yes, there are many companys that have their own trucks. Especially for shorter distances like between distribution centers and retailers. But for any other form of shipping, outsourcing trucking is already prevalent.

Long story short: my question here is, what are your thoughts about this and who might be a the winner? Is it companys like FedEx and Amazon, who have a huge fleet of trucks and can suddenly offer different kinds of deliverys, like freight forwarding ^is ^that ^a ^word^? ? Is it the company that builds trucks? The software? The tire manufacturer because trucking will grow exponentially? The satelite operator? Anyone else?","['FDX', 'AMZN']"

The first autonomous trucks drive from rally points between cities. Highway driving is the easiest for autonomous vehicles since there is very simple traffic rules and few unexpected obstacles. Once at the check point they will switch off to a manual driver if needing to drive in more complex environments. 

several trucks will have a single remote operater. If a truck is having a problem it will alert the remote operator to take control until the truck can resume driving again. 

Andrew Yang is one of the few politicians who is recognizing this and trying to help out before all the truck drivers are laid off.

And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”

So I'm fairly new in this topic. I did some reading in the threads provided here but it didn't quite provide the answers I was looking for.

Currently I (27M) am working in a company that provides a ESPP, up to 15% of my salary monthly, purchased in 6 month installments (at a 15% discount). I can change my contribution once per year (every May) and cash out every 6 months (after the purchase has been completed). Currently I contribute 3% of my salary only, but want to bump it up to 10%. The ESPP is done via eTrade. This is where my questions begin: I would like to sell my stocks (as I don't want to be holding single stock) and invest in some ETFs or something more secure. I see Vanguard recommended a lot on here but since my plan is through eTrade I would prefer keeping it simple and using them- but how do I begin?

Any good resources to read up on this, to properly set up my account for this and any other tips to a beginner?

One additional note I would make is that I am a dual citizen (US/German) and live and pay taxes in Germany. However the Etrade account is US based, and in USD. What sort of tax implications do I face and how do I deal with them?

Some fear there will be a lot of competition from other brokers who have better features such as lower fees and more.  

I saw a video where they were talking about a Crypto Broker IPO coming out soon that will have huge upside potential.  But I don't know which one and they wouldn't tell you without buying the service.

I saw in other places that Kraker which is the fourth biggest broker is coming out with an IPO in 2022 for example.

There’s been no shortage of posts regarding high valuations / the potential bubble / the supposedly inevitable correction/crash/bear market. Whenever there is a post asking how to best prepare/protect against this potential correction, the general response is “lump sum always beats DCA / don’t try to time the market.”

If I first began investing in a basic s&p 500 index just before the dot com bubble crashed, and lump summed all of my cash, it would have taken me nearly two decades to get out of the red, that is, if I was able to hold all that time without selling at a loss. As a new investor, I’m afraid of this happening again. I’m debating whether or not it’s even worth investing right now, but the general sentiment seems to be to never hold cash trying to time the market.

I’m not investing for retirement, as I have a pretty good pension plan and I’m still relatively young (25). For someone with no money currently in the market who is looking to invest  with more short term goals (say 5-10 years), what is the best option given current valuations? With the knowledge you have now after years of investing, what would your strategy be?

What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

(collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

The inverse also tends to be true on what to sell. Sell off low growth yield, sell off companies that are going to be adversely affected by rising wage input prices or rising input prices for the base commodities. 

**So in other words, go long on:** Oil, metals miners, agricultural inputs, banks, insurance companies, companies with pricing power. Industrials (XLI) tend to be good at the start of reflation, but as inflation starts to bite into the economy, a lot of the industrials end up getting hit hard from high producer price inputs. Industrials tend to be sensitive to demand from emerging markets, so a lot depends on what is going on there.

n90hkk,,investing,post,1620639488,"Market valuations and investing allocations - indexes vs stock pickingHi.

I want some input here, cause I simply can't make my mind up.

I'm currently holding my PF, while adding a small amount of money in 5 different index funds monthly.

In terms of money I'm saving about $ 700 in an world index fund every month as locked in pension savings, and another $ 700 in 5 different index funds for personal savings (E.M., Scandinavia, Europe, World and small cap - I'm considering wiping the Europe fund here, but I digress). So that's $ 1400 montly in indexes.

I'm also stacking about $ 2000 in cash every month. This goes hopefully into the market in the future or as downpayment on my mortgage (depending on inflation and change in interest).

Other than that I have a stock picking PF with a handful of companies. 

Now here's the kicker. I'm aware I can't time the market. I don't believe I can, but the question is whether I see a big upside in indexes from here on. And I'm not sure I do. The markets might keep growing a bit more, but I feel the risk reward is unfavourable atm, and I wonder if indexes isn't the right thing now. I honestly feel far more comfortable with doing value buys, and there's less risk of buying dividend blue chips who aren't in favour.

A few months ago my last big buy happened and that was Bayer AG. After that I've kind of been on the sidelines as I haven't seen anything interesting.

What's your opinion on investing right now? Would you stick to investing heavily in indexes or rotate into stock picking?  If so, would you sell off index funds? Or ride it out?",

If you have identified an undervalued stock in a given month, invest your $2,000 in it. If you don't have one, buy an ETF instead. Or switch between ETF and stock each month.

You should probably also stick to some other rules you set yourself ahead of time to help you follow a strategy rather than giving in to well-known pitfalls. For example, maybe don't allow yourself to buy stock you already have a position in (so eg. you don't convince yourself it sure will go up now, after all it's fallen 25% since you bought it).

n8zfda,gxm8t3a,investing,comment,1620660467,"FWIW this has very little to do with ETFs structurally.  In fact there's a pretty good argument to be made that money flowing into market weighted ETFs is better than money flowing into stock picking (from the retail perspective... opposite from the institutional investor).  The argument being that since ETFs are market weighted, to they extent that they exert pressure on the overall market (and it's arguable how much they do), that pressure is felt evenly rather than in specific stocks reducing price distortion (or distributing it more evenly).  Ironically institutional investors would likely prefer the distortion (hence lots of ETF bad articles) as price distortions are potentially profitable trading events (this is how pump and dumps work).                       

Anyways this article is not great.  The author fails to distinguish risk differences between leveraged ETFs and broad market ETFs.  Pointing out that a leveraged ETF outperformed a broad market ETF in a bull run is garbage tier analysis.          

As others have pointed out, historically retail investors chase performance.  Performance chasing is typically a bad strategy.  When the retail investors show up to the party, that party is typically over.  They buy out the institutional positions and the market runs out of momentum because future growth is being baked into the stock prices.",
n8nkcd,,investing,post,1620594296,"Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?",

Leveraged real estate does not outperform unleveraged investment in the S&P.  It doesn't outperform it historically, and we would expect the gap to widen as real estate prices continue to rise.

i dont think getting lucky picking tech is the same as low risk. if your comparison relies on hindsight analysis its probably pretty ineffective

real estate allows for pretty significant growth. keep in mind that you use a significant amount of leverage when buying real estate, if you put down 20% on a 1m property and it grows 10% in a year youve gained a lot more than 10% relative to your actual investment",

This is the first time I have ever seen every single asset class so substantially inflated: stocks, real estate, crypto currency. Whatever it is, every asset class is at all time highs. We all know the reasons why this is the case: excessive money printing & all time low interest rates have created a yield hungry environment with inflated asset prices.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

I started when I was 18—using left over scholarship money and whatever my dad gives me (not much, but I saved and invested). I’m not really sure what to do with my recent profits—other than pay ST taxes. I have a medium risk tolerance, my objective is to hold for a better future, I have no debt, but I still want to keep some in a high yield savings account just in case. I was thinking crypto and index funds that pay dividends, but I’m not really sure how to go about it—I don’t want to act on impulse and make a dumb decision.

I realize that this thinking flies in the face of the ""time in the market, as opposed to timing the market"" strategy. 

So, the bulk of my retirement is in a Vanguard Target Date Fund, which I contribute to monthly. I also have a legacy retirement account from a former employer, which earns 4 percent annually. I am considering rolling over those funds to my Target Date IRA though. Thoughts?

I also have 6 figures sitting in a cash reserve account earning a paltry 45 basis points; wish I had been more aggressive in March 2020. Anyhow, my thinking is to invest a portion of those funds in the vehicles below now - taxable account - and leave some dry powder for potential corrections:

- Emerging Markets (FEMKX): I have roughly 5% exposure in my Target Date Fund, but am looking to possibly increase based on future market forecasts. Thoughts?

- REIT's (VGSLX/VNQ): I don't have any exposure here and like the potential, as well as the dividend yield. Thoughts? 

- Disruptor Fund (FGDFX): A Fidelity alternative to Cathie Wood's disruptive funds. 

- Other: Alternative / Renewable Energy, Cannabis, and Biotech Funds/ETF's: Thoughts?

n8hkut,,investing,post,1620577266,"Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

A real risk parity portfolio should use futures (as All Weather and AQR do) for the lowest financing rates to efficiently achieve a high enough allocation of low vol assets. Many retail investors do not have a broker that supports futures or enough capital to practically use treasury rate futures, so some use leveraged ETFs or options instead. Many risk-parity-flavored model portfolios like All Seasons and Hedgefundie's do not bother to actually calculate a risk parity allocation, or update it over time, and instead use a simple static allocation that is close enough. There's nothing magical about doing an exact rp allocation though. It's just another method of generating diversified portfolios without full knowledge of future asset performance.",

n8j1vj,gxitca8,investing,comment,1620584772,"They'll sell it.

For particulars you need to the read the prospectus of the Index. The prospectus will explain things like how closely they will mirror what they are indexing. There is usually an allowance for minor mis-weighting of stocks. There is also an allowance for how much time they have to make changes.

SPY is suppose to make changes, as needed, at least once a month and they allow the fund to make changes more often during periods of significant change.

But this can get complicated quickly too....ETFs are designed to be sold and traded between investors, but new shares  of the ETF can also be created or redeemed each business day... The holder often will redeem shares if the holdings in the ETF are undervalued by the ETF price. This is the mechanism that keeps the ETF consistently values with what is in the fund.  This means the index has to buy or remove stocks for the fund on a daily basis in very small amounts. (redeeming typically only happens on a large institutional level)

Typically this buying, in particular, starts adjusting to the new weighting of the S&P 500 index, so companies that were removed or lost value are more likely to be sold and companies that gained value or were added are more likely to be bought.

This means each day the fund starts changing towards the more updated index they are trying to mirror through the natural change.

&#x200B;

Lastly, it is important to remember if an ETF index fund is weighted by market capitalization, the companies that enter of leave the index are usually a tiny fraction of the index's total capitalization.

Just as some examples, #450 is only 0.032% of the index, #500 is only 0.016% of the index, #400 is 0.043% of the index.

The top of the index #1 is 5.76%, #50 is 0.43%, #100 0.23%... and so on.

The reason I mention this part is most companies being removed from the index usually fall in market capitalization over a period of time before they are dropped from the index. They become a smaller portion of the index as it drops in market capitalization, so the index has likely been slowly selling off the asset over time.

By the time it becomes #480 before not being in the index at all, it is very small. There isn't that much to sell, so there is somewhat of a gradual change built in to the fund in most cases... Of course, any large abrupt changes in the market, means larger changes are needed at one time in the index portfolio.",['SPGI']

n8fpef,,investing,post,1620571698,"Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",['GOOGL']

Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

So the whole idea of CET1 is that it's capital the bank's investors stand to lose.  That's usually equity, but also any earnings they're entitled to which is why retained earnings and AOCI get lumped in there.  In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize.

Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.",['CB']
n8pzgh,,investing,post,1620601476,"The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow RapidlyI may do a much longer and well-sourced post on this when I have more time, but here's a rundown of why the small arms industry, in my opinion, is an excellent long term investment, not even looking at how the Biden administration will play into the cyclical nature of gun stocks.



**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",['AAPL']

n8pzgh,gxjsk1n,investing,comment,1620602317,"Doubtful, there are not much innovation in the gun making industry, what innovation there is often goes bankrupt soon, such as the Hudson H9. When was the last time S&W or Ruger or etc came out with anything that is truly revolutionary for the civilian market?

Not to mention the constant deadlock on gun control, I assume as a US person, all other countries are becoming more and more strict on gun control, making guns harder to obtain and more socially unacceptable.

War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growth, not the civilian market.

Just because the pandemic and political situation helped the gun industry (jury's still out on that) doesn't mean it's a safe long term investment.

Guns are on a long-term growth trend, but to a large degree, guns sales the past several months have been driven by a) yearly seasonal effects (hunting season + people blowing their tax returns), b) a Presidential election year, which always sees higher gun sales and c) the pandemic and ensuing recession caused a buying spree.

Right now all three of those effects are going away, so I expect gun sales to decelerate rapidly over the next few months.   I've finally found some guns I've been looking for in stock again after months of them being sold out, which suggests my thesis is correct.

Right now it also applies to Tesla’s stock.*[https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-needs-a-catalyst-here-are-some-contenders-51620434748?mod=hp\_DAY\_2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-needs-a-catalyst-here-are-some-contenders-51620434748?mod=hp_DAY_2)

The author's argument is that Tesla lacks a big catalyst to drive shares higher. He doesn't mention new factories under construction, or the push into cryptocurrencies, or changing opinions toward electric vehicles. The bottom line, he argues, is that TSLA isn't going straight up.

>*After an epic rise, the stock has stalled. That is just what Tesla stock tends to do—rocket higher after major milestones, then do nothing for a while.*

The author's point is valid, but also irrelevant. Unless your investment horizon is right now, this isn't a problem.

The same point could have been made about Amazon 10 years ago. Or Netflix. Or Apple. Or Shopify. Or Bitcoin. No investment goes straight up forever. That's ok. If you're in a hurry to make money fast, then maybe Tesla isn't the right investment. Most of the people who made serious money investing in MSFT, AAPL, or GOOG, or AMZN, or NFLX, or FB, or SHOP, held on for a longer time horizon. If you bail because there are no short term catalysts (that you know of), or because the stock goes down short term, you may kick yourself later. Even Bitcoin dropped 80% 2 years ago (from its then all time high of $20k). People who bailed then missed a great opportunity.

n7cmlw,,investing,post,1620431992,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returnsRecent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?",['ARKK']

n7cmlw,gxdgsdy,investing,comment,1620469016,"""now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.""

I think it's questionable that fund managers should be out there predicting their returns for the next 5 years. I can't recall another retail fund manager that has ever been in the press predicting literal % returns for the next 5 years (or 1 year for that matter.) A manager might say ""I expect a good year for tech"" if they're a tech fund or that sort of thing but I can't recall another mutual fund or ETF manager saying ""I predict X% annualized for my fund for the next 5 years."" I thought it was iffy when she did it earlier this year and now she's doing it again. So to me it's not even the math of the projections but the fact that she continues to do it in the first place.

She's really ""hyper growth all the time"" - the issue becomes it's not going always be in favor (and I think people took last year's unbelievable/once in a great while performance as confirmation/validation of hyper growth rather than possibly a ""grand finale"" - at least for a while - to cap off a decade where growth was largely the ""only game in town""), but she invests as if that's the case. Look at recently with her selling large liquid names into declines so she can buy even more of smaller, less liquid things a lot of which she already owns 10% or more of. What if she sells all the large liquid names and the decline keeps going? I wish Ark could be more dynamic in its approach - it feels like everything has to be hyper growth all the time or it's not ""on brand.""

""But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist)

She's said that there will be declines/corrections, but she doesn't invest as if that's the case and those statements are offset by her very bullish long-term predictions. ""There might be some big declines, but listen to how well this is going to do!"" I said early this year on here that the performance was not sustainable as the discussion became more and more Ark-y on here.

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly (""What to Expect From Funds After They Gain 100% or More in a Year? Trouble, Mostly"")

 Additionally, how much of the money that has poured into Ark came late? The inflows really didn't start en masse last year until in the second half of the year when the funds were already up 100% YTD. Tons of new investors started earlier this year and I'm sure a lot of them went right to Ark, chasing last year's performance. 

""Money Tree"" seemed to be the peak in Feb. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree.

Employed $3500 USD p/m

Objectives: Long term growth and investment / retirement

Time horizon 10-15 yrs

Risk tolerance: moderate

Holdings $6000 USD, no debt, $3000 USD liquidity

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.",['SPGI']

n7802u,,investing,post,1620418954,"Competition is Growing in the Telehealth SectorThe pandemic has changed a lot of things for good, including healthcare. Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.

   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* MNST
* MPWR
* MTCH
* OLED
* PAYC
* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For    those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked  against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date,  including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

\*I    am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to   ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results   and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t    understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and    henceforth. You are welcome to do whatever you like with the    information, though if you’re going to sell it that’s some pretty messed    up \*\*\*\*. Past results are no guarantee of future returns.","['CHD', 'DG', 'MSFT', 'MNST', 'AAPL', 'AMAT', 'TROW', 'PAYC', 'SPGI', 'VRTX', 'IP', 'EW', 'ATVI', 'IBM', 'TER', 'LRCX', 'ABMD', 'REGN', 'APH', 'ANET', 'TSLA', 'TDY', 'GRMN', 'ADBE', 'FTNT', 'ACN', 'ETSY', 'INTC', 'EXPD', 'MPWR', 'INTU', 'LKQ', 'NVDA', 'CPRT', 'FB', 'CDNS', 'ISRG', 'PAYX', 'MKTX', 'PHM', 'ODFL', 'ALGN', 'TYL', 'KLAC']"

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['NFLX', 'WMT', 'AMZN']"

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",

n6dh3d,,investing,post,1620324294,"I sold every share I own today.I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

The 1-year T-bill rate today is .06, no surprise but pretty depressing. That ciphers out to be hardly worth messing with. I can't convince myself that any muni bond is 'safe' but that might be because I haven't studied them in any detail.",

n75u6r,,investing,post,1620413353,"Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls ShockGold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.","['ED', 'PM']"

First off, what is your percentage gain per year and what is your strategy to beat the market?  Also, if you have access to this data, what is your risk metrics such as Standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, Alpha, Beta, R squared.

My idea is that in order to beat the market, most people have to take outsize risks.  Me for example.  Here is my stats...

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.

I’m personally optimistic about the future of nuclear companies due to their potential contributions to any goals towards reducing carbon emissions. There’s no way we’re going to meet these targets without a large push to nuclear, and it seems like NuScale is the furthest ahead out of the new technologies. For example, they are the only SMR to have an approved design by the NRC, and I think it’s only a matter of time before they get more customers signing up to get plants in the US and around the world. 

Looking at Guggenheim’s history, it seems like they have steered similar companies towards a SPAC offering. How can I try and get in on any public offering if they are looking to go this route?",

These are not big misses but make the company one of the few high-growth cloud players that underperformed market expectations.

n6l995,,investing,post,1620344980,"The Roaring 2020s (Economy/Stocks)So.

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Conclusion. Get in losers, were doing the roaring 2020s. And they are mad that the poors have a better chance of capturing income in this decade.",

I've noticed that a good number of serious, professional and semi-professional intraday and swing traders focus on a couple of dozen stocks. My question is, do stocks have their own unique personalities, and if they do, what are the best ways to learn what they are?

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

n7pr3w,gxe2fpl,investing,comment,1620484165,"You have to be careful with your line of thinking.  For one thing, our brains are always trying to find patterns in randomness.  I remember there used to be something called the “superbowl” indicator where someone figured out that if a team from the old AFL won the superbowl it predicted with 90% accuracy what the stock market would do that year.  Of course it eventually stopped working so well because it was just the human brain trying to fit a pattern to random historical data.  The other thing is that even when there is a consistent pattern, if the pattern is detected by enough traders, the form of the pattern will be changed by their trading.  For example, suppose a stock always went up on Thursday morning.  Traders would start buying like crazy on Wednesday afternoon in anticipation, which would make the stock go up Wednesday afternoon instead of Thursday morning.",['AFL']

n6fysa,,investing,post,1620330775,"In just 3 months, Tesla has issued 80% of the shares ARK's valuation model projected they would issue through 2025.Their model is beyond amateurish.  Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

n6klu0,,investing,post,1620343064,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

Happy investing!","['SPGI', 'SIVB', 'AMZN', 'YUM']"

n6klu0,gxaqfnb,investing,comment,1620409257,"I'm a little conflicted by this line of argument. I recommend low-cost indexing to anyone who asks in my personal life, so I definitely support the broader argument here. Further, there are entire subreddits dedicated to [obvious scams](https://old.reddit.com/r/NKLA/) and other pump-and-dumps so there's clearly a need for this type of analysis.

On the other hand, it's so alien to my experience that it comes off to me as unpersuasive. I've probably held 50+ individual stocks in my life and none of them went defunct. Even broadening it to every company I've put on a watchlist, that number is still zero out of 200+ companies. The few delisted were products of M&A, and generally profitable for shareholders.

This article itself shows the numbers are vastly different for large companies, where 77% of the top 1000 companies by market cap made positive returns and just 7% are gone.  Further there's the minefield of Biotech stocks which decay steadily to zero unless they develop a profitable drug. [18 of the 32](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_stocksonly,ta_perf_52w75u&ft=3&o=industry) stocks down 75% over the last year come from this one industry - two more are generic drug developers.

Finally, even if stocks were exactly the unavoidable minefield described in this article, it's not a mathematically persuasive argument against active investing. After all, an active strategy could also include direct indexing where an investor owns merely *most* of an index. If owning just a few stocks is bad, then owning all but a few has to be the mirror image, right? You're effectively indexing + shorting a bad active strategy.",

n6rgw5,,investing,post,1620366351,"Possible overvalued stocks in S&P 500Hi,

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

Obviously, I'm assuming some things wrong, but did I underestimate all these companies?","['TSLA', 'MSFT', 'ADBE', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'SPGI', 'NFLX']"

It's 150%, actually.

>Through which business segment?

Ads. Their ad revenue growth was 77% YoY for the last quarter and it doesn't really have costs.

>Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.

I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.

* Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously [cash-heavy](https://merchantmachine.co.uk/most-reliant-on-cash/) countries.
* After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.

> AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.

* There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.
* Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.
* The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend)).

Taking the points above into account, we probably won't see a massive decline in AWS growth for a while.","['AMZN', 'GOOGL']"

I need to look into the growth further.  However, it's concerning to me because they just reached profitability in 2020.  A quick look shows revenue growth could decline from 14% to 10% in the next 2 years.  That's down from 40% just a few years ago.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

• Q3 GAAP EPS of -$0.03 beats by $0.10.

• Revenue of $1.26B (+140.2% Y/Y) beats by $140M.

• Q3 ending Connected Fitness Subscriptions grew 135% to over 2.08 million and paid Digital Subscriptions grew 404% to approximately 891,000; total Members grew to over 5.4 million.
Q3 Connected Fitness Subscription Workouts grew 239% to over 149.5 million, averaging 26.0 Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscription, versus 17.7 in the year-ago period 

• Q3 Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn was 0.31%; Q3 12-month retention rate was 92%.

________
Extra info:


• The company said it generated record quarterly revenue of $1.26B and a 5x increase in paid digital subscriptions, but the meaning of those results is far from clear after announcing yesterday that it had stopped sales and recalled its Tread and Tread+ treadmills.

• The company did not offer a full-year forecast with its results, but would provide revised guidance on the earnings conference call later today.

• For the quarter, connected fitness subscriptions and paid digital subscriptions jumped to $1.02B and 891K, both exceeding analyst consensus estimates.

• Peloton said delivery times for its original exercise bike have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, but ""While progress has been made, additional work remains to reduce delivery times across the remainder of our product portfolio and regions.""

_____
Update:

• While noting that a recall of its treadmills would knock $165M off FQ4 revenues, CFO Jill Woodworth forecast quarterly sales of $915M and an annual total of $4B, not far off previous annual guidance for $4.08B in sales.

Sure, they're an equipment manufacturer, but look at recurring revenue in their competition: It is a rounding error. Whereas PTON keeps growing their digital footprint YoY and their retention rate would make anyone jelous.     

Now obviously COVID so YMMV, but if they can keep retention at 80% this time next year, this is definitely an interesting long term investment for the ecosystem/brand alone.",

Tech earnings are receiving all the hype recently, and if you guys are like me, you’re looking for stocks to get into at low prices, and ride out the growth (we’re all aiming for the next TSLA). While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply.

Based on this, does it make sense to invest in Berkshire for the long term based on his comments versus an index fund?

n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['SPGI', 'KO', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

TL;DR Warren & Munger ""Our wives are filthy casuals""","['SPGI', 'WFC', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx62vky,investing,comment,1620319497,"I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN']"

n6dntx,gx6vsvo,investing,comment,1620331436,"Valuing a company is always personal, it is about what and where you see the company going in your eyes and then transforming this into numbers.

Now you talk about valuing a company, FCF and market ratios in the same sentence, but market ratios refer to what the market values a company at, and that is already reflected in the stock price (pricing).

So do you want to price your company or value it (intrinsic value)? And to me it sounds like you want somebody else to do that for you (asking for a tool), but keep in mind that valuations reflect personal projections and can vary heavily based on whoever or whatever valued it.

If you want to actually learn how to value young/growth companies yourself, then I suggest this:

Generally a good way to value a growth stock at first glance is looking at the market cap and then looking at the revenues they bring in and seeing what the annual growth rate is for that revenue year over year. That is how you get the price to sales and assess if the growth rate justifies the valuation it is trading at. Then I would look into earnings and financial statements to see how the path to profitability could play out and what their debt to equity is and how much cash they are burning. Of course you should do a much deeper dive and look at their quarterly statements, look at their management and leadership, and the fundamental aspects of the business.

>  
>The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”

>  
>The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
>  
>**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
>  
>In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.

>Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
>  
>The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
>  
>“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
>  
>Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
>  
>**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families.

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

n62yvd,gx4ptgu,investing,comment,1620292253,"Personally I have always believed the buy price is very important for achieving solid long term results. E.g. buying a company that grows 10% a year at half price over time would give you almost the same amount of gain as investing in a company the grows 20% a year at full price, assuming market valuation appreciates to fair value. Of course a 20% growing company would have a much higher valuation, but a 10% annual gain compounded by a 100% appreciation to fair value would give you very decent returns.

nard6c,,StockMarket,post,1620833176,"Confused about Wash Sale rules I just started investing with Fidelity and I have been pretty active. I also have some minor OCD so I have made some decisions that I have undone relatively quickly.

I bought a number of stocks and ETFs that I regretted a few days later and sold to eventually move into broad market indexes. After a few days, I even sold most of my shares in the broad index to just wait and see what happens with inflation and the rising CPI and to just ease my mind.  I think I jumped in too fast.

I'm concerned that most of my sales have a small percentage that is a 'Wash Sale'. I understand what a Wash Sale is, but I don't see how that applies to all of these stocks that I bought and then resold a few days later. I know it occurs when you sell a holding for a loss and then buy a similar one within 30 days, but I don't think I did any of that. I never rebought any of these stocks.

Would I get a Wash Sale because I sold a stock for a loss then purchased a broad market index?  Or do you get a wash sale every time you sell a stock for a loss that you bought in the past 30 days?

Also - I sold most of my shares in ITOT today for a loss, and I have a few hundred that is listed as a Wash Sale (positive). Is this because I had purchased the initial stock within 30 days prior? If that is the case, how is it possible to day trade if you are penalized for selling a stock for a loss that you bought within the past 30 days? I'm a new investor and confused.",
nard6c,gxv4uc2,StockMarket,comment,1620833883,"Yes: *Or do you get a wash sale every time you sell a stock for a loss that you bought in the past 30 days?*

Remember, a  wash sales is a loss you can't use as a tax deduction against ***ordinary income***.  Selling at a loss was your call, that's not a penalty. 

You can get a wash sale if you add to your position (lowering the average) then selling above that average BUT below the original purchase.  Those original shares would be sold at a loss - hello wash!

&#x200B;

ProTip: Ignore wash sales.  Concentrate on realized gains.  That's what you pay taxes on because that's profit...and that's all that matters.",
nard6c,gxv6jki,StockMarket,comment,1620834578,"> If that is the case, how is it possible to day trade if you are penalized for selling a stock for a loss that you bought within the past 30 days?

You aren't penalized. You just can't deduct that loss against capital gains. I think you're confused about the overall impact of the wash sale rule. Just don't worry about it until it's time to file taxes. There's no point in trying to evade it, it only exists so people can't easily reset their cost basis without paying taxes.",

I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market.

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to roughly break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve.

I'm 19 years old right now. I didn't start trading 4 months ago, I started the summer after sophomore year in high school when I got my first job and put  $3.5k into the stock market. Out of the 4.5k i made through that summer. But until just 6 months ago it maybe grew from 3.5k to 4.6k or something like that, because I just put it into a few random stocks and didn't really touch it.


Around November 2020 I started buying and selling like crazy and making some not bad purchases, like Tesla, AMD, NVDA and some others which got me to where that first screenshot was taken.

I read an interesting post from a knowledgeable investor that I now remember during Red Days in the market. When days are red it means it’s a good day to Buy while Green days are good days to Sell. I know it’s hard for me sometimes but going bargain hunting for lower prices.  Taking emotions out and not panicking is hard. Keeping eye on $XELB, $THMO, $RHE, ACY and more once my scanner is run later. Good luck with your trading today!

Here is the full text of his wisdom: “when this is red, its a good day to go shopping.. when its green its a good day for selling. its opposite of what we would normally think. **second lesson**,: the stock market is a game of probability. everything you do,, either fundamental research, or technical research, its all about increasing your odds of winning.. absolutely exclude emotions from the picture, unless you intend to use them to assume everyone elses overall sentiment. if you buy when its low and sell when its high religiously your a far more likely to make money than buying blindly.”",

Here are the results.P**reamble:** The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

https://preview.redd.it/ir6jqgjwsay61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d057f55015d8e25479815bfe760d4dde81240de6

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

https://preview.redd.it/mnijwbqwsay61.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=828da0f685646a73946097f6b0dd86f753de024b

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

https://preview.redd.it/95cl91nwsay61.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ffc2fc430e5b7f3157ae4f264872d3ef95a0b2

If you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/75nyoa5ltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5b27919716360fdbaf31f4548f4d21e0401b49

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/xing6reltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9c3d13abbb8b060fecf8cee7b312bbdfd6efaf

These are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades

https://preview.redd.it/k4r34rpusay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=084ac821754d87d42d2f1ac9b822a9015125a443

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/igyz3jwdvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=223b91d21b9201211a21ea24ec2daee0627b9166

The top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators

https://preview.redd.it/fd66tjagvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e92ab79c5b7316eb95e70dc22bed0b2f8615127

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

na8yo0,,StockMarket,post,1620770402,"I'm having trouble with this> NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks hit a one-month low on  Tuesday as speculation that rising inflation pressure could prompt  interest rate hikes sooner rather than later dragged on shares and  hobbled the dollar, which hovered near a 2-1/2-month low. 

We woke up this morning to learn that inflation, that we've been hearing about for months, is really scary today, and the price of gold dropped. Inflation means the buying power of the dollar will fall and investors sold gold and, essentially, bought dollars so they could ride the loss down. That's not the way it worked in 1979 when the inflation and interest rates were 11%. Gold went up 120%. For gold and bitcoin to drop, now, doesn't make sense. 

At the end of the day, inflation wasn't so scary after all, gold rose and half my holdings ended in the green. It's an improvement for me, but still... If it isn't scary in the afternoon, it wasn't scary in the morning. It smells off.

I'm calling bullshit on inflation fears and I'm all in on the dip. I'm damned certain that I'm not holding onto dollars through an inflationary period. I'll rethink this when interest rates hit 15%, again.",

Every other sector becomes more reliant on tech every day, so to some extent tech gets boosted no matter what. That some companies are over valued I won't disagree with. Nor that inflation worries are completely unfounded.",
na28ol,,StockMarket,post,1620753624,"Something I noticed with the efficient frontierI recently built an efficient frontier app that is built on python and hosted on my github. App [here](https://share.streamlit.io/diegodalvarez/streamlit_efficient_frontier/efficient_frontier_streamlit_base.py). 

But sometimes I would run it an get a plot that would look something like this

https://preview.redd.it/5njgwkt6uey61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=c72316eb317aac613177c8006489b421bf993907

I thought it was interesting that I would get this shape with outlier points when I am used to this shape

https://preview.redd.it/wp9mhjcauey61.png?width=1162&format=png&auto=webp&s=4813450df3e5b12d4255f7675b9401ae8fabd040

So I started looking into the problem and my first assumption was the number of tickers. The first test was around 30 stocks and the second test  was 6 stocks. Each used the same calculation method 10y of daily historical adjusted close data using mean returns and covariance with 100,000 simulations. I then built a function in python that drops tickers and then runs the efficient frontier and this is what the results look like. 

https://preview.redd.it/p5akvjyduey61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e235f6d1737d3a25745bb356f5008cf657252c

The way that this function works is that it pulls stocks from S&P 500 and then it drops a random amount of tickers then runs the efficient frontier over and over. It uses 10y of historical  adjusted close prices, mean returns for returns, covariance for risk, and 100,000 simulations. The title of each graph is how many tickers are used. Also the algorithm doesn't redraw after each calculation, it drops from the previous test. 

I ran around 10 test which you can find in my github repo ([here](https://github.com/diegodalvarez/efficient_frontier)). I also kept track of what tickers are used in which test. What I've noticed is that the efficient frontier starts to fit a more ""curvy"" shape as we decrease the numbers of tickers used. Later tests will involve using different groups of stocks separated by industry, risk, and return characteristics. 

I have also added this function to my app above which you can find by selecting the ticker drop function on the left side bar. It does take a long time with 16 efficient frontiers, more than 300 stocks, and 100,000 simulations each so it takes some time. You can also pull the code from my repo and run it in python yourself.

Something that I've also started working on is using anomaly detection to get rid of the outlier points for the minimum-variance and the mean-markowitz portfolio. 

I was also wondering why this shape occurs. If anyone has any ideas that would be great. I'm not sure why with more stocks it looks this way.",['SPGI']
na28ol,gxrjv3p,StockMarket,comment,1620760683,"Because you are using historical data and a LOT of stocks-- this means it's easy to find combinations that seem to good to be true, because you are selecting the best basket of risk-reward from the past when you have that many stocks.

&#x200B;

When you use less stocks, the frontier has greater eccentricity. This is because higher returns are demanding an accelerating amount of risk, which is typically the case.

&#x200B;

Just know that by using historical data and many, many stocks, your efficient frontier is too good to be true. Obviously these portfolios you are getting would have a hell of a Sharpe up till now, but this is not for fundamental reasons -- it's just selecting the bunch (out of 300) that have crazy sharpe's because the sheer number of stocks will allow for this to be crazy.

&#x200B;

Also, I have a feeling that there isn't convergence for the large amount of stocks example. Think about the problem of picking a portfolio out of 7 vs 300. 300 stocks will require so many simulations to find the best portfolios that I doubt you are converging. In fact, since the blobs aren't changing much I would guess you aren't converging past 9.",

n9nw4j,gxpk4vs,StockMarket,comment,1620724474,"Inflation - the printing of dollars devalues the currency, inflated costs have to be absorbed by companies, as these companies trade on future revenue this is forecast to go down and so their value does.

Scarcity - commodities and key components have been hit by supply shortages due in large to the pandemic. This also causes inflation and lack of growth for companies dependant on these to create their products. They project less growth and so their companies value goes down.

Earnings season - many companies have proven themselves with great results in the pandemic but predict a slowdown in growth as we move out of it somewhat because of some of the reasons mentioned. (Additionally, many suffer from buy the rumour sell the news).

COVID - as the west starts to see light at the end of the tunnel with COVID, consequences of the spending to fight it are on the horizon. The exact consequences are uncertain and the market hates uncertainty.

COVID 2 - people have had more spare cash through the pandemic as they haven’t been able to spend it on their usual vices, it is uncertain if many areas that have grown due to this will be be able to maintain the growth. Again, the market hates uncertainty.

Overvaluation - the market has been overheated for some time with companies trading at multiples way higher than historical precedent. This has placed it into a widely acknowledged bubble. People are anxious over when the bubble will pop and so any signs of a decline trigger sell offs. 

There are lots of smaller triggers such as pipeline shutdown etc, but basically the market has been waiting to dump for some time. Claims people are not selling are from the new and naive retail investors who believe everyone that shouts Diamond hands in their echo chamber. Yes big players can move the market if they transition large positions, but all they are doing is rotating to protect their customers money. This isn’t manipulation, regardless of what cult conformation bias will try to say. 

Is this a dip or the start of something worse? Anyone who knows that will be making themselves very rich. The market could collapse tomorrow or growth could stop with prices declining slowly over a longer period to where they are more traditionally valued. Or governments could change policy and try and reign in inflation, or the market could decide it is just a dip and enough buy into it to stabilise it; the possibilities are endless.

In times like these the best thing to do is re-evaluate your portfolio, if your happy you bought good companies for good reasons, then don’t worry. If your brave, and can see opportunity, buy the dip.

For any companies your worried about, assess their fair value based on a standard market, not this past years bull market. As long as a company is growing it can always climb back to its previous valuation, how long that takes just depends on the depth of the crash and how overvalued it was by standard metrics.

Anyway, not financial advice, just my personal take on the situation, as it’s based on opinion lots could be wrong so best to DYOR.",

n9e68p,,StockMarket,post,1620675955,"I think a lot of folks don't understand what they are talking about when they claim market manipulation.Prices are by definition, 'manipulated' because traders make money on price action in both directions.  A trader's job is to force the highest possible trade before changing direction, hoping to create bagholders and then generate sentiment in the opposite direction to buy back at a lower price. That's what they are paid to do. Algorithms are constantly learning herd behavior so they can trade ahead of it.

Investment funds exist to aggregate user money to make bets on the collective results of the world's traders, who are now mostly lines of code coded by mathematicians and statisticians. They trade on inside information and they all front-run the herd with misleading information or selective omission.  As the investing public, we've all agreed that it's ok for them to cheat because they are cheating on our behalf in the form of investment savings, and pensions. We just ride the whale. For non-institutional traders like myself, we don't trade with a particular ideology.  We just follow the whale. The funds are not 'smart' money as the media often claim. They are huge pools of money and their moves create their own gravity which affects the algos they own and benefit from.  I apologize.  They are 'smart' in the sense that they will always have information ahead of the rest of us.  

I would hope that the few actively traded funds who display their trades each day have demonstrated they are not particularly 'better' at this than you.  They just have more money and can keep buying the dips or calling the top until it actually happens.  As I said in another post, you're not necessarily worse than someone else, you just don't have a big enough account to offset your mistakes as they do theirs.

The market will always go up because if it didn't, these folks would not be able to attract investor money.  Over the decades, the market has collectively decided 7% - 12% is a good return because it's enough to attract new money into the hands of money managers and yet not high enough to discourage randos to try to beat it on their own - thus maintaining the illusion of a market.  The price is the last trade, whether 100 shares or 1,000.

You will always win in the long term if you just buy the broad market because it's designed to win.  That said, if you're all in with the money you need tomorrow and you're riding out a correction, then that's on you.

Although ZKIN is listed on NASDAQ, we are looking at SPX500 because it's more used index to determine the trend stocks and there is a significant correlation between SPX and NASDAQ.

If SPX falls below pivot support at 4120, it may drop further and sharp to 50 daily EMA at 4080, with stem dips to 4000 - 3980.

SPX has to find support at 4120 - 4130 area, otherwise a stronger correction may occur that will impact every stock. Same applies for ZKIN.

4h overall trend has turned into an downtrend, but as it's pretty far away from these levels, we look at least for a correction higher before another drop, or just a sideways movement.

RSI suggests that bearish momentum is present as trend of lower lows is active and RSI is below 40.

MACD is in strong selling wave while the bearish volume is increasing.

na0mc5,,StockMarket,post,1620749530,"GEO YOLO - Downside LOW, Upside HUGE, Squeeze Potential NOT ZERO, Michael Burry INDear Sirs and Madams,

I was browsing Michael Burry’s portfolio and came across a deep value opportunity.

First of all, the shorts are in this stock:

[YAHOO](https://preview.redd.it/atz2rzq9miy61.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=8280e9fb9e800b280e81f1f1bc5a353ae4515f6e)

The company is a pureplay in providing incarceration and resocialization services to the government. Not a sexy business, but I want to earn money and not become the Mother Theresa of Stocks.

The stock got slashed because the operating environment for GEO was fundamentally altered when President Biden issued the Executive Order on Reforming Our Incarceration System to Eliminate the Use of Privately Operated Criminal Detention Facilities on January 26, 2021.

Therefore, the business fundamentals have changed, and the stock got hammered.

Since the company is listed as an REIT it had a high dividend yield. However, they have cancelled dividends and they will perhaps change the structure.

Looking at their balance sheet, they own a ton of real estate that is financed long-term. Short term assets outweigh the short-term liabilities, so the probability of bankruptcy is close to zero near-term. They have been highly leveraged forever. Also, will they use cash on hands to repay debt.

For a detailed valuation, I fully support the latest analysis from Seeking Alpha by Hugh Akston Investments.

Taking the value of the highly specific real estate and one chooses a comparative approach or valuing the company at replacement costs, equity value is around $15, presenting a 200% upside with - in my opinion - no further downside, since this is heavily protected by the fair value of the assets.

Management needs to implement strategic change and I believe that over the next 1.5-2 years the company can generate shareholder value by selling or leasing out profitable assets and adapt their services to the new circumstances.

I opened a YOLO today.

[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/60r3pi1umiy61.jpg?width=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3104b27f817b98529a8733ccc379ca34c4b665e4)",

Interest payments aren’t well covered by EBIT. 

Doesn’t look like this business is in great financial health to pull off a total pivot but I could be wrong.",
na0mc5,gxt2kmj,StockMarket,comment,1620785965,"I've been pondering this same exact play over the past couple of days for very similar reasons.

Two important things to note: 

Burry bought into GEO **before** the government had announced their plans to not renew their contracts. This had been a pure value play (hence Burry's entrance) before that occurred. That announcement alone qualifies as one of Graham's main ""real reasons why future earnings power won't be like those of the past"".

Second thing is that REITs don't do well during inflationary periods. Burry had a tweet storm or two in February about the upcoming inflation and included a graph showing which assets do well vs. which do not.

All of this is to say that I would not be at all surprised to see Burry cut his losses and exit his prison REITs in the soon-to-be released 13F for Scion.

The graph I'm referring to is in one of the two twitter compilations I posted in r/Burryology. [This one perhaps?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nadmmz/inflation_series_part_3_twitter_compilation_2/)",['TWTR']

n9g4rn,,StockMarket,post,1620680864,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 10, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**

Stocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressures and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, it’s worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.

Market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting he said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Looking ahead, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens.

Further spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from “overheating”. She said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she seemingly downplayed her remarks, saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

While it may seem like doom and gloom, this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldn’t begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating. Last Friday, the April Job Report reported only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020. The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon, with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report coming in far below estimates, the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soon.

In short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete.

**Highlights**

* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary.""
* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game ""Fortnite"" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.

n9vrc2,,StockMarket,post,1620735704,"$DOX - A Leader in Media & Communication Digitization (Long DD)**Introduction**

Of the many forces of society, the advancement of technology is one that is truly unstoppable. From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance, technology has changed the way people live their lives. The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate & improve their offerings/operations. This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited (Nasdaq: DOX), a technology and software product/service (such as consulting) provider that serves companies in communications, media, finance, entertainment, digital, etc.

**Company Overview**

Established in 1982 In Israel, Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri, US. For 40 years, Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients’ operations. With 26,000 employees, Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries. Their clientele comprised of leaders in a wide range of industries: telecom giants AT&T & Bell, financial institutions like HSBC, and general crowd favorites such as Amazon, 7Eleven, and Microsoft.

Most of Amdocs’ offerings are provided within “amdocsONE”, a comprehensive collection of products/services consisting of: Digital Experience & Monetization; Media & Digital Services; Enterprise & Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks & NGOSS; Services & Hybrid Operations; Technology & Practices-Driven Innovation. With its “cloud-native, modular and open offerings”, Amdocs helps clients smoothly and fully transition into tech-automated, digital operations.

In such a demanded market with high-ticket clients, Amdocs recorded $4.16B in revenue during FY2020 (ended September 30th, 2020), at a 33.9% Gross Margin, 19% EBITDA Margin, and 11.9% Net Profit Margin. DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow, recording $910.7M in the Last-Twelve-Months ending in December of 2020.

Yes, everything seems to be working out well for DOX, but that brings up the question: is there still room to grow, or has DOX plateaued, making it a safe bet, but not a high-return investment?

**Capital Structure & Shareholders Breakdown**

A quick look at Amdocs’ capital structure: **22% Debt, 77.1% Common Equity, 0.9% Minority Interest.** What is important to point out here is that DOX has **recorded $0 in debt** for 3 straight years from FY2017-19. This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0% leveraged. In contrast, most of its competitors are operating around the 15%-25% debt/total capital ratio, comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording \~40% leverage in its capital structure. 

When it comes the shareholders of DOX, most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders. Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors, with FMR LLC. as the largest holder. The large scale and consistent (holds & buys) asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable, stable investment.

**Looking Long**

Overall, I believe DOX shows potential at a hold/buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued, but experienced & matured company.  The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX:

* **Strong & Consistent Financial Performance:**

As an established company, we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins. Although these no longer large-scale increases we would see on a growing tech company, DOX’s consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment. In more detail, DOX has a 2.9% top-line 5-year CAGR as of December 31st, 2020, with corresponding 3%, 3.6%, and 10.4% 5-year CAGR with EBITDA, EBIT, and Net Income, respectively. Although top-line growth was contracting a few years prior, it has rebounded between 2015-20, which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations/cloud systems. Nevertheless, the higher (and increasing) bottom-line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins (it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec.31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years, which were around 2.2%-5.3%). DOX also has a strong cash flow, largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow. The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.

* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**

Through “amdocsONE”, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation. From cutting 80% of time-to-market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers, to continuous operational support and open tools/cloud platforms, clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs. Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience & Monetization; Media & Digital Services; Enterprise & Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks & NGOSS; Services & Hybrid Operations; Technology & Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs’ platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs’ cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users’ operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service & Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service & network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service & network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.

The wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.

Last, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \~20% of their gross profit into R&D. This shows the company’s dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.

* **Extremely Low Leverage**

The last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company’s overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.

**Macro Market Trends**

The overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX’s performance:

* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  

   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.
* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**
   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.
* **5G Penetration & Advancements**
   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:

1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.
2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.

In the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.

**Financials and Valuations**

When it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.

**Risks**

To finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:

* **Cyber Security**

Although moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the “first door” is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.

* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**

For Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.

**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**

Overall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:

* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.
* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.

**TLDR**

An undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%

n9b8y5,,StockMarket,post,1620668732,"VIRGIN GALACTIC CATALYST Lets start with this...

94.2% of the shares available to short have been shorted. (Borrowed & sold at market)

34.2 million shares are estimated to be our shorted shares.

We know 161 million shares available to trade publicly. We also know 70% of the shares are held by insiders & hedge funds. This leaves 30% of 161 million = 48.3 million shares available for shorts to buy back.

So the ""actual"" short interest is 34.2 million / 48.3 million = 71%.

This will likely get higher as the flight is announced, more shorts will pile up.

Additionally, as we've seen during GME/AMC, during the squeezes, hedge funds & day traders buy in to hold more shares hostage for quick cash at the expense of shorts.

This will go very very bad for shorts if a flight is announced and executed properly. Which is a pretty good chance, as the engineers had more then enough time to fix the problem and likely add improvements to SS2 that were implemented on SS3.",

n9ncsq,,StockMarket,post,1620702206,"where can I find quarterly report of Skillz? 

After I heard about their earnings, I wanted to look at specific financial statement. I first went to their website and found quarterly reports that I saw online. However, when I went to SEC.gov, their 10-q filings seemed to be a lot different than Skillz quarterly results?

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1801661&owner=exclude](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1801661&owner=exclude)

Also, their filings were under different name, is this becauee Skillz is a blank check company? I thought all publicly traded companies were supposed to file under SEC.gov

[https://investors.skillz.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx](https://investors.skillz.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)

Lastly, does anyone see 10-q for q1 here? it's their official website but only have 8-k for 2021",
n9ncsq,gxou7xm,StockMarket,comment,1620703717,"Q1 Earnings and financials:

Likely that although they've issued a press release and had an earnings call, they haven't filed the 10-Q yet for 2021Q1.  Sometimes there's a delay between press release and filing.

Can you  explain what you mean when you say their "" 10-q filings seemed to be a lot different than Skillz quarterly results? "".    The 10Q on Edgar and the one on their website look exactly the same to me, other than the fact that one is in HTML and the other in PDF.

The name on the earlier 10Q, ""Flying Eagle Acquisition Corp"" is the name of the company that was originally listed.  After listing, that company acquired the business ""Skillz"", and thus renamed itself.",
n9ncsq,gxov995,StockMarket,comment,1620704334,""" However, when I went to SEC.gov, their 10-q filings seemed to be a lot different than Skillz quarterly results? ""

OK, I get what you're seeing.

If you look at the Q1-2020 10Q, you'll see that the revenue was ""-"" (zero) for that quarter; however, if you look at the news item for the most recent quarter (Q1-2021) it shows the prior-year revenue as ""43,559""

The difference seems to be because the older 10-Q is reporting the revenue of Eagle Acquisition corp, which was nothing but a shell company with no business, and therefore had no revenue at the time of filing.  Since then, Eagle Acquisition corp achieved it's goal and acquired an \*existing\* business called ""Skillz"".  This business had it's own prior financial results.  However, because it was not a publicly traded company, those results weren't filed with the SEC.  And because they were acquired by an existing firm, they apparently aren't required to publish audited financial results for previous periods.

Maybe someone will correct me but I think that's what's going on.",

- average market return in 7-8%
- average market p/e is around 11-12x

So basically anyone buying above 11-12x would theoretically end up with a return below 7-8% in the long term and anyone buying below would make a return higher than 7-8%

This is what this graphs confirms. However, it is a view for the whole market. 

If you are able to pick the winners, you can be above 11-12x and still make above market-average returns.

On the contrary if you buy a shitty company, no matter if you pay below 11-12x PE, you will still underperform the broader market.",

I beg of you to take this post as serious as possible as I lay out claims that might not be considered ""realistic"" by some of you. Again, this is one of the most important issues of our time and I thought that it would be a great way to share this information with you guys since the spread of information on this platform is unmatched.

The issue that I am referring to above is the growing contact/sightings of possibly extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings and crafts on Earth. This is an issue that everyone in the world should be familiar with and allocate their greatest interest in order to find the truth behind this. This post is very unusual compared to the others on this subreddit as most posts are stock market related. However, I promise that I will show the intersectionality between this global issue and finance throughout this post.

I first began to become interested in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief, Haim Eshed, announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real. He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a ""Galactic Federation"" where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made. Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars. The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand ""the fabric of the universe"". Around this time, America's former president, Donald Trump, established the seventh branch of their military, the Space Force. Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation. He even says that Trump was ""on the verge"" of disclosing their existence, however, he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause ""mass hysteria"" due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide, COVID-19, and degrading international relationships.

Keep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible, reliable, high-ranking, and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue. This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest-ranking officials. It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit. Not only that, but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well. This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space. You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality-shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011. He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that ""if I had come up with what I’m saying today five years ago, I would have been hospitalized"". In the end, he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has ""nothing to lose. I’ve received my degrees and awards"". Again, this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three-time recipient of the Israel Security Award.

Here is the original Jerusalem Post article \*PLEASE READ\*: [Jerusalem Post Article](https://www.jpost.com/omg/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-aliens-exist-humanity-not-ready-651405)

In December of 2017, the New York Times published an article entitled, *Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O. Program.* This article was one of the first publications to give an in-depth investigation of the current state of U.S. intelligence about UFO's (unidentified flying objects) or UAP's (unidentified aerial phenomenons) as they are known today by the U.S. Government. In the NYT report, it provides evidence to prove the U.S. Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings. According to Defense Department officials, included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country. The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring. The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012. However, when the program's backers were asked about it, they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue.

[New York Times Article \*PLEASE READ\*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html)

One of the most fascinating things about this program was the examining of videos showing encounters between these unknown objects and U.S. military aircrafts. Three videos on this subject were published by the New York Times entitled ""FLIR1"", ""GIMBAL"", and ""GOFAST"". The videos were taken by Navy fighter jets belonging to the USS Nimitz and USS Roosevelt. All three of these videos show cockpit display data, infrared imagery, and even audio communications between the pursuing pilots. The UAP's displayed in these videos showed unprecedented and ""impossible"" aerial maneuvers that is unmatched by any technology present on Earth at this time. One of the fighter pilots, Commander David Fravor, who was part of the F/A-18F team that attempted to intercept the UAPs in 2004, had only this to say to the *New York Times:* “I have no idea what I saw...It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s.” Another fighter pilot witness named Chad Underwood described the movement of the craft as ""not behaving by the normal laws of physics"". Furthermore, he described the UAP to not be ""behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move"". In addition to this bizarreness, all the pilots involved stated that the crafts didn't produce a heat signature, fumes, or even a propulsion system. Overall, these crafts can only be labeled as otherworldly as they clearly aren't capable to be developed by our current standards of science and innovation according to these pilots and other significant figures in the scientific community.

[""GIMBAL"" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TumprpOwHY)

[""GOFAST"" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUrTsrhVce4)

Although these videos showed compelling evidence of extraterrestrial existence, it still was not confirmed by any government officials to be raw and genuine footage. Some of the videos actually surfaced on the Internet as early as 2007, as they were being passed around in various website forums. It wasn't until September of 2019, when a spokeswoman of the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were in fact 100% real and recorded by Navy aviators. She also added that this was ""part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years."" This was one of the first incidences of the U.S. Government confirming that unknown and physics-defying air crafts have entered U.S. airspace.

[Confirmation of Video Authenticity by Pentagon Representative](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ufo-video-authenticity-pentagon/)

More recently, in April of 2021, a new video published by [Mystery Wire](https://www.mysterywire.com/) showed yet another case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The video took storm on the web and showcased a swarm of pyramid shaped aircrafts hovering over a U.S. Navy destroyer in night vision. The UAP's flashed with bright lights and performed physics-defying maneuvers. Additionally, what stood out about this incident was that the crafts were ""transmedium"" vehicles, meaning that they could transition from air to water seamlessly. Also, three photos supposedly taken by Navy fighter jet pilots displayed three different shaped UAP's. The objects the Navy Personnel captured on his iPhone included a ""sphere"", an ""acorn"", and a ""metallic blimp"". Although the video clip and photos originally didn't seem to standout from the other UFO videos found on the Internet, it wasn't long for a spokeswoman from the Pentagon to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos. Susan Gough, the spokesperson for the Pentagon said that, “I can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.” As you can see, this is an ongoing issue that most likely happens very frequently. It wasn't until now that the people of America can really see what secrets the U.S. Government is hiding from its citizens.

Now you may be asking yourself ""what happens now?"" Well in last years' gargantuan $2.3 trillion appropriation bill that was mainly for COVID-19 relief aid for millions of Americans, contained a rider that was provided by the Senate Intelligence Committee. For anyone that doesn't know, a rider is when an additional provision is added to a bill while having little to do with the main subject matter of it. In this case, the rider mandated that the director of national intelligence works with the secretary of defense on a report to detail everything the U.S. Government knowns about UAP's. The small provision in the 5,500+ page bill also warranted that the report be released within 180 days of the bill being signed. Donald Trump signed the bill on December 27th, 2020 so that means that UAP disclosure should be released in early June. Some speculate that this report will contain all the secrets the U.S. Government has regarding unidentified aerial phenomenons while other say that they will only release the minimum amount of information in order to be labeled as a ""UFO report"". What do you think? I'd love to hear your opinion!

[UFO Disclosure Article](https://nypost.com/2020/12/29/covid-19-bill-started-a-180-day-countdown-for-ufo-disclosures/)

While this is potentially one of the greatest ongoing issues in human history, I'd like to take a minute to fulfill my promise of connecting this global issue to the stock market. All the evidence I provided were confirmed by some of the highest-ranking individuals on this planet. This means that there is a high probability of similar events occurring in the near future. These events could be increased UFO sightings, more government confirmations of UAP encounters, or even extraterrestrial contact. Overall, what is absolutely certain if any of these events take place, is the growing awareness of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings by the general public. Based off human emotion, people will not take this news lightly. I truly believe that many humans will panic after hearing the startling news of unknown crafts traveling over their countries airspace without their country's military able to do anything about. People will instinctively go into a defensive state meaning that they will purchase more weapons like guns, knives, and ammunition. Some people will most likely even commit suicide due to the feeling of insignificance and defenselessness by this devastating news. Additionally, there will be a massive pushback against the U.S. Government because of this unprecedented and excessive government secrecy regarding this issue. Most likely the government will stay intact and billions of dollars will be put into the military as it is the only structured organization that can defend against this off-world threat. However, this will be the start to a new concept of what us humans call life.

What I stated above sounds absolutely horrific, however, our species need to recognize the fact that we may not be alone in this universe. New information we find on this issue will happen inevitably, it is more of a question of when. Investing in military defense stocks like Lockheed Martin ($LMT), Raytheon ($RTX), and Boeing ($BA) will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios. The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above. The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics. The final scenario is that the U.S. military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information, they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public. All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U.S. military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase. Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government. Again, whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact, this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses.

Now if you can take one thing from this post, it is that information is ESSENTIAL. What the U.S. Government has held from its people, is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history. This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth, we deserve to have this information told to us in full.

nanynr,,wallstreetbets,post,1620824027,"I analyzed 9000+ trades made by U.S Congress Members in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.**Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks have been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is 

**Did Congress Members beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?** 

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to u/rambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by Congress who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades) 

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately. 

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end. 

**Analysis:**

**Distribution of Trades**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kh4ythn8roy61.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=c054d4e698ab159a8b4fdd3cdaa88e8a3ea2fb43)

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the Congress Members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made the Congress. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some Congress members are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a. One Month 

b. One Quarter 

c. Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns of Congress Members vs S&P500**

https://preview.redd.it/j5lejvpdroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4edea1cb42cac7ecab4e9e6c5b034ace5d9ac566

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress members did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark. 

**Returns if you followed their trades**

https://preview.redd.it/rnuw3kyhroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ea3a1ab53fd502a2968939891bd11e9da84c8a

If you had invested in the stocks Congress Members bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit. 

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted answered was which were the best trades made by Congress Members over the last 2 years. 

**Best trades made by U.S Congress Members**  


[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0xatcb5rroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d157bba30bcd309db66bd51ababcf36e7c76710c)

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Congress Members were successful as shown below. 

**Worst trades made by U.S Congress Members**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/dfsg5lksroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c41517d7299e6b62cbd6dfa1bbdf42a672d750)

These are the worst trades made by Congress Members with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period. Brain Mast also makes an appearance in the worst trades making him a prime candidate for some WSB loss porn.  

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered Congress Members having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades. 

**U.S Congress Members having the highest returns**  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/7yk3wa4wroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad6ae5de91e6ec8ade045378e72983dee356b0c)

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Congress Members comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. Next thing I looked is the Congress Members that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.

**U.S Congress Members having the highest amount invested in stocks**

https://preview.redd.it/x4vb26xxroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c34019c2a724babc40a9823ec513e7a69e562aaf

The top 3 Congress Members as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S Congress Members 

**Most popular stocks among US Congress**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/t4vv63s1soy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=327b56f8cbfff8465b09e797272a45ccde46429c)

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have $100B+ valuation. 

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

a. The time period of analysis is 2 years on which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in market downturn/recession 

b. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to it (you can find it in the Google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress Members. 

c. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range. 

**Conclusion:** 

This analysis proves that Congress Members indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader's judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Congress Members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That’s big money ! But let’s dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float.  $UWMC has a very small float. 

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F**kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says “We can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !”

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it’s higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data. 

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25% 

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now. And I know a few of my fellow Redditors are sitting on serious blocks of stock, like me. So how many shares are there available to trade hands ? 5M ? 10M ? If everyone on this sub owned just 6 shares we would own the entire public float. Can you idiots buy and hold a stock ??

On top of all this we still have Russelll Inclusion to be announced in June  and another blow out 2Q is in the works. 


Think of a reason why you shouldn’t park a few dollars behind a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% divided with a current p/e under 4 ? 


I don’t know how to add pictures, I had some nice screen shots for you apes. Because I know you are more visual learners. So I made a TL,DR in emojis.

napgpn,,wallstreetbets,post,1620828291,"The market is giving us an absolute gift with these inflation numbers, it’s time to load up the truck, PSLVWe’ve got a massive overshoot on inflation, coming in at 0.8% month over month versus 0.2% expected.

Annualized that’s a 10% inflation rate.

Year over year core CPI came in at 3%. The last time we had a yearly core CPI at 3% was 1996 and the fed funds rate was 5%, not 0%.  The last time we had monthly core CPI advancing this quickly was 1980.

So what is the reaction among gold and silver, the traditional inflation hedge plays? They are selling off and the dollar is rallying.

Why? The market is now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike, despite the insistence of the fed that there won’t be one.

Once they digest that rate hikes won’t happen, this is the next black swan.

Will JPow spit in the face of a market that is fully pricing in a rate hike?  Usually the fed likes to go along with market expectations rather than shock the system.

I believe they won’t raise rates or signal that rate hikes are coming soon.

We still require massive fed and fiscal support to keep the economy and market from crashing, and they will choose the economy over keeping inflation in check.

What happens to the dollar when a 100% priced in expectation doesn’t happen?  Eventually the market is going to realize rates are staying at 0% regardless of inflation.

When this sets in, gold and silver are going to uncharted heights.

Silver is essentially levered gold. Look at my profile and find the stickied SLV post, read past the part bashing SLV and you’ll see silver is the investment to dump 20% of your big boy money into to save yourself this decade.

In most decades equities will massively outperform metals. Every few decades the opposite occurs. In the last two silver bull markets silver outperformed equities by 40x and 25x respectively during their 10 year run ups.

Look at the 50-year cup and handle forming on silver, and tell me it’s not a screaming buy:

&#x200B;

Load up the truck, mortgage the house, buy PSLV

Alternatives: buy physical silver if you don’t care about liquidity (keep premiums below 20%), buy silver miners for even more leverage, buy options on miners for even more leverage. Just don’t touch the scam that is SLV.

Play it how you like, but please, if you have some ‘set it and forget’ type of money, put 20% into gold or silver through the 2020s. You can sell it at the end of the decade if you want to.  This sub has a habit of pure momentum trading, if someone suggests a ticker, every ape looks it up and if it’s already massively green they jump on the train. This is an opportunity to jump on a train before it’s running.

There is very little free floating silver in 1000oz bar form, and the [LBMA just spoofed 10% of it out of existence ](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/lbma-misleads-silver-market-with-false-claims-about-record-silver-stocks/). Look at lumber, rhodium, palladium. That’s what happens when supply runs out and shorts are forced to continuously cover in a commodities market.  This can easily happen in silver.

If you read that article you'll realize that when WSB piled into SLV in early Feb, that actually did nothing because SLV didn't go out buy the silver.  They sold us paper lies and then their authorized participants shorted futures.  We have since learned that SLV is a scam and are buying PSLV and physical.  No more wool over the sheep's eyes.  We are coming for the metal, and taking the little silver that there is.  Banks who are massively net short can come begging later this decade at $500 an oz

Will update with a much longer DD next week!

Ericsson to pay $97 Million to Nokia for after settling damages claim

Reuters

Telecoms gear maker Ericsson [(ERICb.ST)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ERICb.ST) has reached an agreement with Finland's Nokia to pay a damages claim of 80 million euros ($97 million), it said on Wednesday.

Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. It settled with the DoJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.

The DoJ had [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU) that Ericsson admitted to conspiring with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify books and records and by failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.

Ericsson said on Wednesday the settlement would impact operating profit (EBIT) by 80 million euros and cashflow by 26 million euros in the second quarter.

""The amount reflects uncertainty, risk, expense, and potential distraction from business focus associated with a potentially lengthy and complex litigation,"" it said in a statement.

The Swedish company added that the remainder of the settlement amount would be made in similar instalments in 2022 and 2023, impacting cash flow.

""Nokia can confirm that the information in Ericsson's press release is accurate. We have no further comment,"" a spokeswoman said.

Ericsson did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.",

narcj3,,wallstreetbets,post,1620833127,"Inflation is not goddam transitory!!! Stupid!!! 🌈 🐻So Jpow has been cranking the printer handle like his own meatstick at a furious pace. 120bn a month and stonks are flying to the moon, hedge funds partying and going all in on 20x leverage like degenerates. Margin loans are through the roof, higher than never ever ever before and Jpow tells us at this point that inflation is transitory.

Lets explore what that means via an easy to follow macdonalds example.

Suppose you work at macdonalds, i know they probaly dont hire people on the spectrum but bear with me.

Lets say you make 12/hr as a human hamberger robot. Prior to pandemic, you barely survive on your salary. But having now lived 1.5 years on gov assistance, getting paid more than your shitty ex job to do absolutely nothing, you are planning to max out this insane period by taking benefits until they kick you off. Meanwhile you look around the shops, everything is more expensive, food, drink, rent, houses, even the cheap Chinese made tshirt is twice the cost as before. Why? The dollar is down and raw materials are more expensive, shipping is higher, oil is higher. Cotton prices are through the roof, bread, fuck me it is up, pork is ridiculously high... In short there is nothing that is not up a huge amount. 

What does that add up to? Previously you were just barely surviving with your shitty 12/hr, now, if you go back to work, you will lose your pandemic unemployment assistance, which means a hefty pay cut while all prices have risen massively. You simply cannot afford to start working!!! If you work, you will work yourself into your moms basement because you wont be able to afford rent, will lose the free health care and still barely breakeven. You are below the watermark on being able to survive as a human. 

This means only one thing. Macdonalds is gonna have to raise wages and fast if they still need humans pretending to be a robot. Once they do, they will have to raiss big mac prices further to compensate for this and the 100% higher price in every single input cost of the hamburger. And once that starts it means you will need a higher wage again because you cant afford to eat and round and round it goes into an inflationary spiral.

By this process, once the fed gets its wish of unemployment falling, inflation will be in the teens, dollar will crash another 20% and they will need to hike to 15% interest rate again like in 70s.

Tldr. Inflation moves up in spirals. It has already started and cannot be stopped. Jpow has no idea what hes talking about. Full on 🌈 🐻. SPX puts.

of course an easy way to push and prod inflation is to dump FUD into the market and convince everyone that in a few months we are headed for the soup lines

naehn4,,wallstreetbets,post,1620787096,"South Park Investment TheoryHas anyone ever noticed that once a company is mentioned in Southpark it is bound for liftoff? 

A most recent example:

\-**Build A Bear ($BBW)**: When the Pandemic Special aired on September 30th, 2021 the stock was at $3.23. Today on May 11th, 2021 the stock is now at $8.90. This can obviously be seen as a standard rebound play. 

Previous Examples:

\-**Amazon ($AMZN)**: Stock was at $1,775 on May 30th, 2019. Today it is at $3,223.91.

\-**Tesla ($TSLA):** Stock was at $31 on October 9th, 2013. Today it is at $617.

Historically, companies that have been highlighted in Southpark have beat the market in the short term and the long term. Many of us know that South Park is extremely relevant in hindsight and we constantly see examples of South Park's content being ahead of its time. 

This investment theory is based upon trusting the masterminds behind South Park and their constant ability to see future trends. Just like following a Bill Ackman play. I recommend investing in a company once they are mentioned in South Park.

 INOVIO's Pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate INO-4802 is not matched to a single variant, unlike other variant vaccines in development; INO-4802 could potentially offer broader immune responses  
   
PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., May 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO), a biotechnology company focused on bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and HPV-associated diseases, today announced that its next-generation Pan-COVID-19 vaccine candidate, INO-4802, induced potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses against the original Wuhan strain as well as against B.1.1.7 (UK variant), B.1.351 (South African variant) and P.1. (Brazilian variant) in preclinical models. These results demonstrate the potential of INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine to induce cross-reactive immune responses against current and emerging viral variants as either a first-line vaccine, or potentially as a boost for individuals previously immunized with various Wuhan-matched vaccines.  


Dr. Laurent M. Humeau, INOVIO's Chief Scientific Officer, said, ""INOVIO is taking a dual-track approach in developing a COVID-19 vaccine because we recognize the need to support both pandemic and endemic considerations. In addition to our work on INO-4800, which we expect to enter a global Phase 3 trial this summer, we are also developing our next-generation Pan-COVID-19 variant vaccine, INO-4802, which is designed to protect against current and potentially future variants of concern. The study data we report today confirms our two-tiered development path is the best strategy for the short- and long-term fight against this virus.""  


First-generation COVID-19 vaccines were matched against the original Wuhan strain. These vaccines may have reduced efficacy against emerging COVID variants. In response, many of the next-generation vaccines under development are matched to a single variant currently circulating. INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine approach is designed to provide cross-strain protection, immune coverage, reduced susceptibility to escape mutants, and non-restricted geographical use against both known and potentially unknown variants. Preclinical data with INO-4802 in multiple models revealed both broader and increased levels of neutralizing antibodies against a panel of variants than strain-matched vaccines. Building on this initial work, INOVIO plans to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials this year with INO-4802.  


To create INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine candidate, variant sequences were identified over a four-month period starting in October 2020 from multiple geographic regions (Brazil, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States). Mutations in the spike sequences were aggregated for each region. The sequence results from these regions were then further engineered to determine a common set of overlapping mutations from emerging variations in the COVID spike protein sequences to generate INO-4802.  


More information from this pre-clinical study can be found in the paper entitled: ""Design and immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine,"" which has been published as a preprint in BioRxiv prior to peer review.","['DOW', 'NDAQ']"

The TLDR is vaguely that instead of scanning everything for ALL the known threats (like traditional antivirus) it seeks to use the AI to classify malware independent of a dataset. If a new virus rolls past your normal antivirus, it likely won't recognize it because it isn't in the dataset. If a new malware goes past BB security AI, it can detect and destroy it.

* Q1 Average Daily USD Volume $2.10B
* Q2 (so far) Average Daily USD Volume $2.25B (+7%)

To provide recurring updates on [my previous DD and research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mua3vo/coinbase_the_volume_dd/), we look at Coinbase Pro's daily USD trading volume to estimate Coinbase's Q2 guidance which should be unveiled in the earnings call on Thursday.

It's previously reported that Coinbase is expected to make $1.8 billion revenue and $800 million profits for Q1. But all eyes are on Q2. We'll assume these Q1 numbers stay true. Regardless, I think this earnings call will boom or bust $COIN because listeners are more curious about Q2 and 2021 forecasts. It could bust if management underestimates Q2 (and maybe 2021) purely for risk mitigation and ""under promise, over deliver"" bullshit

So far Q2 USD trade volume has risen 7%. Running the analysis everyday, I've seen it fall -5% (vs. Q1) before the recent surge in volume. So naturally we can possibly expect Q2 revenue guidance to fall in the range of $1.71B - $1.92B (we can estimate Q2 profits will be $710 million - $920 million). We'll see how accurate this estimate is come Thursday evening.

&#x200B;

As for my 2021 forecast, it really depends on how you think volume will contract.

nam45b,,wallstreetbets,post,1620817833,"Growth companies in Medicare sectorSo I know there is some discussion with regards to the Medicare expansion to ages 60+ and of course whether or not it comes through may be questioned. However I feel the impact if this were to come true, especially on growth companies is HUGE. 

Let me start with quoting the Fact Sheet for the American Families Plan, saying Biden is making a plan:

*""creating a public option and the option for people to enroll in Medicare at age 60, and closing the Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of Americans gain health insurance ""* [WHGOV](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/)

This would be an increase of 10M+ people eligible for medicare. [Demographics](https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/demographic-statistics) In 2019 Medicare expense was around 800 Billion [cms data](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet#:~:text=Historical%20NHE%2C%202019%3A,16%20percent%20of%20total%20NHE), which would be around $13.000 dollars per person.

Now heres the thing: Out of a total of 61.2M people who receive Medicare [Medicare stats](https://www.ncpssm.org/our-issues/medicare/medicare-fast-facts/), only 5 percent switch plans every year, translating to around 4 million people yearly.  [REUTERS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-medicare-advantage-complex-idUSKCN0RZ2F520151005) This shows that competing within the market for existing users is very hard. 

Now I understand this 250% increase of the fishing pool is a one-time effect, but as people are unlikely to switch plans these people are likely to be bound long-term. Therefore finding these companies that we feel can respond to such change has huge appeal to me. 

Based on the above data and assuming a lower $10.000 dollar expense to be on the safe side, the usual market for people switching plans is 40 Billion yearly. When this Medicare change is made it will be over 100 Billion. Imagine the impact on those growth companies that are ready. I feel the companies with a market cap of say 2-10 Billion could double easy. 

Now I understand I have to make a bunch of disclaimers. 

* Not financial advice
* Data is rough, I made a lot of estimates and rounded stuff up and down: do your own research
* I hold 825 shares of CLOV at 8.79 average.

Happy to hear if you know any other good companies that would be able to reap the benefits of such a change. Also happy to hear if my words make sense or if they are like a ponytail eating clouds.","['CMS', 'GPS']"

I don’t know $clov but I’ve seen it mentioned a lot on here so I’ll have to do some research. Company wise look at Humana, United healthcare and anthem. They all carry Medicare advantage and have become very competitive in the Medicare supplement space whereas they had no interest being competitive a few years ago. If clov’s focus is outcome based, then they are in the Medicare advantage space. Most seniors, especially younger seniors want a supplement not an advantage plan. Advantage plans are great for vets, low income urban populations and older seniors who don’t travel for extended periods of time, aka not for snow birds. Just based on my business, I would say the Medicare supplement market will explode, but also prescription drug plans. In this space again you have Humana as a leader, WellCare (centene), United healthcare and Aetna/cvs. Anthem has entered the space but isn’t big yet, at least in my selling area. I don’t know how clov plays into this, but maybe I’ll do my first DD on the subject, but definitely this space will be a really big deal if we see a Medicare buy in pass. 
From my phone, I’ll edit later for corrections. Also, I own $0 stock in $CLOV or any mentioned healthcare company, I would say the speculation is already priced in if people are already talking about it, but I’m definitely going to keep an eye on it.","['ANTM', 'CVS', 'CNC', 'HUM']"

nadqwg,,wallstreetbets,post,1620784732,"CLOV- Will Hindenburg hedge fund win on 05/17/2021?Following WSB for the last 2 months, I have noticed many stonks mentioned. Among the top 5 is $CLOV andHere is the thing about $CLOV:

**Clover Health** (NASDAQ:**CLOV**) started  trading on the Nasdaq Exchange back in January after completing its merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (NYSE:IPOC).

Hindenburg Hedge fund had taken a large position against spacs in general [(Google: Hindenburg vs spacs)](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&bih=698&biw=1280&hl=en&ei=xi2bYJL5MdfY-gSE86a4Cw&oq=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BQghEKABOggIIRCgARCLAzoICCEQqwIQiwM6BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHlC3KFjPNWDINmgBcAB4AIABY4gBpQaSAQE5mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpergBAsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiS9Pu5_cLwAhVXrJ4KHYS5CbcQ4dUDCA4&uact=5), and thus $CLOV merger with a SPAC had become one of their targets: [Hindenburg CLOV report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/).

Hindenburg has been shorting $CLOV since FEBRUARY 4, 2021, and then a law suit against $CLOV appeared by Robbins LLP (lawyers), and guess who hired them: Hindenburg Hedge Fund [Hindenburg Robbins LLP](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=698&ei=bDCbYK36Dt-90PEP5quV8A8&oq=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEJECEEYQ-QE6CwguEMcBEK8BEJECOggILhDHARCjAjoCCAA6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOgQILhBDOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQoAEQiwM6BQghEKsCOgcIIRAKEKABUMZTWLmtAWCvsAFoBHACeACAAZwBiAHPE5IBBDE2LjmYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEAyAEIuAECwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwit4P78_8LwAhXfHjQIHeZVBf4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5)

Since then they have been bombarding with press releases of $CLOV being under investigation (misleading title as if the FBI or SEC is investigating).

If you read about the lawsuit, it's all about the SPAC merger, because as far as it comes to CLOV, there are no problems. 

The fundamentals are strong with CLOV still growing in the hundreds of millions per quarter (not $500,000 like MVIS) and the technicals show that it can't get any lower.

Hindenburg taking a large stance against spacs, had made them overlook $CLOV  as an actual success, and they are spending a lot of money to try and cover their shorts,

CLOV is the real deal when in comes to a squeeze because it actually has value. If there is no unity behind this, it means that the whole movement stopped with GME and AMC and that is all for stonks (at least for me).

3 calls July 21 @ $35

Alright, I made a post yesterday for the real retards but today I want to speak to those that like actual reasoning. While I do have a Masters in Finance and use it daily to make a living sometimes life throws you a bone that doesn't require too much thinking and bean counting to make a life changing decision. This is one of those times.

ASO, based in Texas is LITERALLY the ALAMO of the crossover sporting goods stores. Their business is conducted primarily in the South East where guns, bullets, and sports is king. Over the past decade all of Academy Sports competitors have bailed leaving them with a totally niche market. What I mean by that is that Dicks sporting goods, Walmart, and all the other big block crossover stores that carried all thing outdoors have bailed on the hunting and fishing aspect. Bass Pro and Cabelas never entered the market, only catering to the outdoorsman, but never to the dad who needed a few bullets while buying his kid a baseball glove. So when I say ASO is literally the Alamo of all things sports related it should become obvious that as far as a brick and mortar retailer who sells everything  from  pink soccer balls all the way to AR-15 rifles this is the true one stop shop. They are solely serving a huge demographic in gods country  where mom will go when she has to buy a jock strap for son, a box of 9mm for hubby, and a pair of yoga pink yoga pants for daughter, where will she go? ASO! If she doesn't want to make the short drive but prefers online, they have a pretty nice website..if you can't see the fundamental niche here, then I can't help you.

They went public in October of 2020 after sales were all but nothing for a full year due to the pandemic having closed down all sporting events all the way down to T-ball, and the freakout of every redneck including myself had cleaned the country of every bullet and gun to be found. Now that sports are picking  back up, moms will need bag chairs, kids will need ball gloves, cleats, socks, cleats, etc. And the redneck buying guns and bullets problem hasn't slowed down one bit. The math is SIMPLE, with every family in America strapped to the hilt with fresh stimulus money ASO can not keep their shelves stocked right now. Couple that with the highest short interest in the country and their stock price is going to see gamma squeeze after gamma squeeze. If it gains the traction it should then it could see a short squeeze never to drop below $100 again. Your Welcome!

&#x200B;

I really wanted to explore the mechanics behind warnings and why we ignore them. This is nothing too crazy, but I feel like it couldn't hurt to remind traders and discuss how our minds can sometimes lead us into danger despite warnings.

&#x200B;

[The Psychology of Warnings](https://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/psychwarnings.html)

>Warning signs and labels are everywhere. Many factors are conspiring to fill the world with more injunctions against our desired behavior. Daily life is increasing in complexity while technology continually invents more powerful machines, drugs and chemicals. Moreover, the cost of injury and insurance as well as accompanying litigation is spiraling upward rapidly. As a result, failures of warning compliance cause costly social and economic impact.  
>  
>Unfortunately, warnings often fail to change people's behavior. Either the warning goes unnoticed, or, as increasingly happens, the warning is seen but ignored  
>  
>...  
>  
>**Factors Affecting Compliance**  
>  
>*1. Cost of Compliance*  
>  
>Many studies have found that warning signs are more likely to be ineffective if the cost of compliance is high. Reducing compliance costs is a very effective way to increase safety, but it is necessary to understand where the viewer's costs arise. Recall that the viewer has a goal in mind when using a device or navigating an environment. The costs relate to the ability to achieve the goal as quickly and as easily as possible.  
>  
>...

* Yachts and tendies. NOW.

&#x200B;

>*2. Danger Perception*  
>  
>Viewer history with the product or environment strongly affects danger perception. The greater the experience with no negative outcome, the lower the level of perceived danger. This is the ""cry wolf"" or ""familiarization"" effect, where people quit paying attention to uninformative input. The effect can be both specific to a particular product (a single drug) or can generalize to all similar products (same type of drugs) or to the warnings source (""those government do-gooders are at it again!"" or ""The company is just covering itself."")  
>  
>One of the ironies of warnings is that the more experienced and skilled the viewer, the stronger the familiarization effect and the more likely that the warning will be ignored.  
>  
>...

* Stonks go up. Printers go brrr. In Powell we trust.

&#x200B;

>Warning Appearance  
>  
>Marshall McLuhan's famous aphorism, ""the medium is the message,"" applies to warning labels. The physical appearance of the warning may inadvertently communicate hazard severity. Most people have unconsciously learned the general rule that signs and signals grow in size and vividness with their importance, presumably so that they will be more readily seen. Viewers will then likely interpret warnings that are small, faint, or located peripherally as signaling lower risk.  
>  
>...

* We want Michael Burry's tendies, but we don't actually want to be anything like Michael Burry.

&#x200B;

>*3. Decision Making*  
>  
>Risk Taking  
>  
>When the viewer ignores a warning, it could be because s/he viewed the cost of compliance as very high or because s/he underestimated the danger. However, studies show that some people engage in risky actions across a wide variety of circumstances. They likely have a high tolerance for risk rather than a tendency to underestimate danger in specific circumstances. Moreover, these risk takers were less likely to comply with warnings. In fact, the prospect of danger may decrease their compliance because the viewer's goal might involve courting danger.

>...

* GUH

&#x200B;

>Social Factors  
>  
>We live in a social context, so other people affect individual notions of norms, standards and acceptable behavior. It is not surprising, that degree of viewer behavior may be affected by whether other people are complying with the warning.

Below are some bits from an [article](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/) by [Jeremy Grantham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Grantham) (Made $265 mil on MVIS lol so he's only sorta 🌈)

&#x200B;

>All bubbles end with near universal acceptance that the current one will not end yet…because. Because in 1929 the economy had clicked into “a permanently high plateau”; because Greenspan’s Fed in 2000 was predicting an enduring improvement in productivity and was pledging its loyalty (or moral hazard) to the stock market; because Bernanke believed in 2006 that “U.S. house prices merely reflect a strong U.S. economy” as he perpetuated the moral hazard: if you win you’re on your own, but if you lose you can count on our support. Yellen, and now Powell, maintained this approach. All three of Powell’s predecessors claimed that the asset prices they helped inflate in turn aided the economy through the wealth effect. Which effect we all admit is real. But all three avoided claiming credit for the ensuing market breaks that inevitably followed: the equity bust of 2000 and the housing bust of 2008, each replete with the accompanying anti-wealth effect that came when we least needed it, exaggerating the already guaranteed weakness in the economy. This game surely is the ultimate deal with the devil.  
>  
>Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%! Nor, in 2008, did it stop U.S. housing prices declining all the way back to trend and below – which in turn guaranteed first, a shocking loss of over eight trillion dollars of perceived value in housing; second, an ensuing weakness in the economy; and third, a broad rise in risk premia and a broad decline in global asset prices (see Exhibit 1). All the promises were in the end worth nothing, except for one; the Fed did what it could to pick up the pieces and help the markets get into stride for the next round of enhanced prices and ensuing decline. And here we are again, waiting for the last dance and, eventually, for the music to stop.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Either way, the market is now checking off all the touchy-feely characteristics of a major bubble. The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears. In 1929, to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination. For us, 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains. In comparison, 2008 was nothing. But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up. The irony for bears though is that it’s exactly what we want to hear. It’s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising.  
>  
>...  
>  
>So, here we are again. I expect once again for my bubble call to meet my modest definition of success: at some future date, whenever that may be, it will have paid for you to have ducked from midsummer of 2020. But few professional or individual investors will have been able to have ducked. The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. They can never put their full weight behind bearish advice even if the P/E goes to 65x as it did in Japan. The nearest any of these giant institutions have ever come to offering fully bearish advice in a bubble was UBS in 1999, whose position was nearly identical to ours at GMO. That is to say, somewhere between brave and foolhardy. Luckily for us though, they changed their tack and converted to a fully invested growth stock recommendation at UBS Brinson and its subsidiary, Phillips & Drew, in February 2000, just before the market peak. This took out the 800-pound gorilla that would otherwise have taken most of the rewards for stubborn contrariness. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.

&#x200B;

Of course, the million tendie question is when? My advice? Just keep hedging.

UVXY 5c 5/14

SRTY 12c 8/20

SDOW 9c 9/17

SQQQ 15c 9/15

&#x200B;

TLDR: People like to ignore warnings when it's inconvenient to abide and/or due to social pressure. This is not a post to talk you into going bear - this is just a post to remind and encourage you to practice risk management and to always properly hedge.","['NDAQ', 'TWTR']"

naupm5,,wallstreetbets,post,1620841526,"Stock Registration for dummiesHello retards, 

I had a question nagging at me ever since Vlad the impaler and old Thomas Petterfy  stopped my flawless dip buy of my favorite stock @ 100 a share on Jan 28th. As I sat there enraged on the toilet slamming my phone screen with my thumbs I was struck with a thought....how do I know that my shares are mine? These shares are actually owned by my broker, and only in my shady ass broker's books does it say I am the owner. is there a way for me to own my shares without having to worry about a broker as a middleman? who does that? why do they do that? what are the pros and cons?

And so today, rather than do my work I finally decided to find out.  So I called fidelity and the customer service rep trotted to the back office to ask his smart accounting nerds because he didn't have a fucking clue either.  Turns out becoming a registered share holder is done through what's called a transfer agent, and these agents are selected by the issuing company.  The transfer agent and the registrar (the DTC) handle the registration of shares in the direct registration system (DRS) which is some sort of electronic book keeping system meant to keep track of who owns what shares. He was kind enough to give me the name and phone number of GME's transfer agent:

computershare 800-522-6645

I then had a web chat with a saucy looking customer rep named Donna A. who told me exactly how I can transfer my shares from my brokerage account to establish an account with computershare:

*The broker will need to submit a request for a DTC* [*W/T*](https://z1.le.liveperson.net/a/54722259/#W/T) *Transmission. Computershare cannot initiate this transfer. If the broker is unfamiliar with the DTC Transmission process, they should contact their back office for assistance or contact their representative at DTC.*

*The broker will initiate the request through their back office using the following shareholder information:*

*1 The complete name of the Transfer Agent: Computershare Investor Services.*  
*2 Tax ID Number (TIN).*  
*3 The exact registration (complete name and address) on the Computershare account. (If the shareholder does not have an existing Computershare account, provide the exact registration as it appears on the brokerage account.)*  
*4 Exact number of shares to be transferred (whole shares only).*  
*5 The full CUSIP number of the stock holding company.*  
*Note: If the registration, address, and SSN match the shares will go into the existing account, if anything is off it will open a new account.*

by ""existing account"" she's referring to an existing account with computershare, which I opened this morning by buying a single share through the directstock purchase program.  this is the second way in  which you can acquire shares in your name, buy them through your account with computershare.  now this process seems less desirable to me. Since buying a share was the only way I could figure out how to open an account through their website (which their phone system directed me to do), I entered my personal info, tax information and a checking account and routing number and then selected how much money I wanted to invest.  I picked $150 for about one share.  I was notified that my purchase will be bought on the market 5 days from now (at whatever price it is), and settled in my account 2 days after (well jesus that's slow).  Donna says they will buy whatever amount of shares they can get for the dollar amount I selected (including partial shares).

It should be noted here, that to sell the shares through the transfer agent computershare is also an arduously slow process.  you can submit a sell order that gets issued to the market on a predetermined schedule (say 5 days from the day you initiate it). I can also transfer them out to one of my brokerage accounts to sell them.  Fidelity warned me that this could take days to transfer, because it requires the request and coordination of individuals in the two back offices to effectuate (similar to when I transferred my shares from one brokerage to another it took 48 hours or so).   I warned them that I might be retarded enough to casually ignore such a warning and if I ever needed to sell which was highly unlikely, well then those buyers won't mind waiting a couple of days for my shares to clear.

so you may be asking why would someone do this, why would they abandon their broker and restrict their ability to quickly buy and sell their shares. There's a few decent articles if you search Direct registration system (thebalance dot com) in google but essentially it was created for:

* investors who want counter party risk against your stockbroker going bankrupt, your claim is with the issuing company, not the brokerage so you don't have to deal with SIPC or the hassle of getting your account back afterwards
* removing the middleman from delivering annual reports, 10k filings, proxy statements, voting info etc. since your name and address are recorded directly these materials are mailed or emailed to you promptly as the shareholder of records
* inability for brokers to lend your shares.  for dividend stocks if your shares are lent for shorting the dividend can become an unqualified ""payment in lieu of dividends"" increasing your tax burden. The brokers don't have your shares, can't use them for collateral can't do shit with them because they are yours
* I have not investigated yet, but computershare has countries outside the US (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom) listed, implying that if I ever move to one of those countries I could buy shares in my name and get access to direct voting and dividends and all the other joys of being a real shareholder. 

TLDR: I was curious how to own my shares directly, not through some shell corporation owned by a bulgarian vampire, so I found out and decided to share with the few of you retards who can actually read.",['GOOGL']

n9ydod,,wallstreetbets,post,1620743617,"Palantir's (PLTR) fundamentals just became even better ( As management said: ""We are a few steps away from becoming Skynet"") 

First of all let's take a look at PLTR's Q1 financial performance.

* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $341 million
* US commercial revenue grew 72% year-over-year
* US government revenue grew 83% year-over-year
* Cash flow from operations of $117 million, up $404 million year-over-year, and representing a 34% margin
* Adjusted free cash flow of $151 million, up $441 million year-over-year, and representing a 44% margin
* GAAP net loss per share, diluted of $(0.07)
* Adjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.04
* Cash and cash equivalents- 2.3 billion
* The company managed to pay almost all of its outstanding long-term debt

These numbers look amazing,especially when you take into account the fact that as the management stated numerous times on the earnings call, the company is just starting to expand and acquire new customers. Many people think of Palantir as this old, mature company that is still unprofitable and with limited growth opportunities. The thing is that despite being 17 years old, Palantir is just starting to get recognition on the world stage. They spent years just developing their software and investing heavily into R and D( over 2 billion dollars). Foundry was launched in 2018 and already is experiencing very high-levels of adoption despite the fact that it is a very complex and expensive software( It is way easier to grow your revenue and acquire new customers on a quarter basis when you are selling cheap and rather simple software solutions, not a complete OS for businesses) . PLTR is also just starting to build a proper sales team ( more than 50 new salespeople hired in this quarter alone) and partnering with organizations like IBM that can pinch their soft. to potential customers. The only slightly negative thing is the fact that currently their european commercial business growth is lacking behind the U.S one, but it is mostly because european economic recovery from the Covid pandemic is way slower. They still managed to close some deals and on the earnings call announcead a new client in Peugeot. Also the Covid crisis definitely helped PLTR in a way, but this does not mean that we should expect a slower growth rate in the future, but qute the opposite. For example, video game manufacturers experienced huge growth during the pandemic, because people stayed at home and had nothing better to do, but that would not be the case in the future. On the other hand, the pandemic helped companies to realise how important is for them to be able to make sense of their large databases of unfiltered information and make better-informed decisions to protect their operations from future geopolitical or macro-economic events.

Palantir is also well positioned to increase their revenue significantly in the government sector, due to the fact that their Gotham software proved its worth throughout the years and they just started their AI based Appolo software.( The Biden admin will apparently invest billions in AI technologies in the coming years).

I would not dive deep into other financial metrics, cuz this DD will become too large, but their margins are insane, cost of revenue grew way,way less than actual revenue, adjusted free cash flow is now positive( insane growth also, wink, wink to all analyst who use DCF) and PLTR somehow managed to expand its business operations while at the same time increasing their cash at hand and having almost non-existent debt.

Let's adress some retail investors worries now. WSB and r/ PLTR are constantly complaining about the high amounts of SBC the employees receive. They of course talked about this on the earnings call and the CFO said that the SBC will normalise in the future( very common for growth companies), but they will still give SBC to employess to align their personal interest with interest of the company ( also very common, especially for soft.companies) and to have more cash for expansion and future investments. Also, they said that Alex Karp is selling shares for tax purposes and he plans to continue being one of the biggest shareholders in the future.

A lot of people also complain about the fact that ""the management does not believe in the company, Karp told me to sell my shares"". The truth is that their believe is actually a bit cult-like. Management again stated that they are convinced of the fact that PLTR will become the most important software company in the future and they even literally said that they are a "" few steps away form becoming Skynet"". Furthermore, they invested in Lillium and Sarcos robotics, cuz they think that it is an incredible opportunity for an innovative startup to use Foundry from ground-zero and not waste years of its development having to deal with data silos and so on. When talking specifically about Sarcos, they said that their are vision for Foundry is to become a digital ""IronMan suit"" and Sarcos is trying to build a physical ""IronMan"" suit and they want to combine their efforts. Yes, that is right. Management thinks that their software is so good, that instead of just selling it to other companies, they can just invest in startups, give their soft for free and reap even bigger rewards in the future.

Another interesting thing we learned from the conference call is that PLTR accepts (the currency that rhymes with groin) as a form of payment. Investing in PLTR is giving you some indirect exposure to the ""forbidden word"" market.

In conclusion, I want to say that my personal opinion is that PLTR's fundamentals actually became better and as Jeff Bezos said the stock price does not always reflect the state of the company correctly. If you did not FOMO into PLTR expecting it to moon immediatly it is probably better to just wait and stick to your conviction that the company's financials will justify its generous valuation in the coming years.",['IBM']

natho2,,wallstreetbets,post,1620838447,"Colonial Pipeline Buying Opportunity??With Colonial pipeline being shut down this week by a successful cyberattack, we are starting to feel the effects of a fragile supply chain reminiscent of the 2020 toilet paper apocalypse. Initially, I didn't think much of it, but now 4 days into it, 90% of the gas stations in our area have run out of fuel. What is stopping something like this from happening to the power grid? Water treatment plants? Nuclear plants? Nothing. Coincidentally on April 20th, the feds (to keep this apolitical) released a 100-day plan on increasing cybersecurity measures to increase protection of, what I now realize, is a fragile and broken system. This was already on their radar and of concern long before the first successful US attack not even 3 weeks after unveiling the plan.  


To the point: With the prepper community starting not to look so crazy after all (swap out the EMP fears for cyber attacks), ***will this create deeper demand for solar energy, generators, and associated industries*** for protection against the now, more realistic, ""what if"" scenarios"" for businesses and individuals?

na7d4e,,wallstreetbets,post,1620766232,"$CLOV Gamma Squeeze DDGreetings fellow autists

For those of you who are not in the know, $CLOV is a disruptor in the Health Insurance industry.They use Artificial Intelligence to leverage the Big Data that can only be acquired as a health insurer to help offer the best medicare plans for seniors & combine that with better care thanks to their Clover Assistant app designed for doctors that combines patient history for AI based clinical recommendations that end up reducing costs & liabilities for their overall model.

""The tech-enabled health insurer differentiates itself from incumbents by collecting and analyzing health and behavioral data to lower costs and improve medical outcomes for its members. It’s part of a new cohort of heavily funded insurtech startups"". [https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/)

What gives them an edge over the others in this space like OSCR, WELL, UNH, HUM, etc. are the people on board & invested - The President Andrew Toy is a former Google Engineer + Google itself has backed and partnered with Clover Health.  Thats a great silicon valley backing, but what else?  Well they have powerful political connections as well...  Chelsea Clinton is a big investor and is on the board of directors.  They also have the former head of Medicare on the board of directors...  these are powerful and important people for a new 'insurance tech' startup like clover.

This stock is a great long term hold on fundamentals alone and has its price target set between $15 - $19 (a great and easy 2x upside from today's price) by the end of the year is besides the point of this post, we also know that certain insiders like the CEO (who owns over 80m shares) cannot even sell their shares until the price has been 30$ for 90 consecutive days...  hmm.

Oh yeah before we dive into the Gamma Squeeze DD - take a look at this beautiful Data Sheet!

&#x200B;

[there are your big numbers, fellow apes!](https://preview.redd.it/a7mcnrqgbly61.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=1589ef5251a8526eb294f27d8b3496425bda00b0)

**So How does a Gamma Squeeze Work?**  

As you all know by now, gamma squeezes are triggered as option sellers are forced to buy the underlying when there is a good chance that the options they sold will be ITM at expiry. Here is the current open interest (contracts for which the sellers would have to buy shares as the price action approaches the strike) for the May 21 expiry :

&#x200B;

[64,000 OI on the 10$ call, 58,000 OI on the 15$ call and a nice 80,000 or so OI on 17-30$ calls..  WOWZA.   and short interest is at 40&#37; ...  ](https://preview.redd.it/qveym8t0yjy61.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0fa80dfb7ac99724d16538903643c88d4e6acc)

Anybody else see a nice lift-off ramp? I sure do.

Now also take this into account.  They announced last week that they will report earnings on 5/17 - this is about 1 month SOONER than originally planned.  They also chose to do the earnings on a MONDAY pre-market...  so note how recently, rocket companies did theirs on a THURSDAY after hours..  a company only reports monday pre-markets if they have good news.

What good news/catalysts???  We know they havent even publicly announced that they added 10 new states and got new government contracting...  so the market will eat that up since it isnt priced in yet + the future potential by Biden to reduce medicare age eligibility.  They could also address the hindenburg report & say that the DOJ investigation is cleared up publicly (it is cleared up, but I dont believe they have made this big public info yet)

And interestingly 5/17 is the week of OpEx (options expiration for the whole market) this is the monday of the week this entire option chain expires .. this usually signifies that volatility will up there.  Any good numbers or Good Guidance reported that day 5/17 could cause a gamma squeeze if the price shoots over 14$ heading into expiration - and a short squeeze could see MVIS-like movement that week.

&#x200B;

[hmm. that could be one hell of a week in terms of volatility.](https://preview.redd.it/3i1ljwzzzjy61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab159cac733ff1393287e9991c362174812a0320)

As an added cherry on top, the stock has been severely suppressed by short sellers in the 2 months and SI is hovering over 40% now so shorts may have to cover if any type of volume & momentum come into play next week based on their report since retail and insiders now own more than half the float.

Obligatory **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** and this is not financial advice

Positions :  3000 shares for long term holding +

150x 15$ calls 5/21

200x 30$ calls 5/21

nar2n9,,wallstreetbets,post,1620832445,"New to options. Made a mistake!Hey guys! I recently started trying my hand at options trading. I’m still totally new to it and had a question for you guys. I think a bit of context might help you first though, lol. So I bought 100 shares of a stock at $4.43. I sold a call option at $2.5 cuz it had the highest premium. (I said I was a newb, I will happily take a barrage of insults!) and the expiration date was set for May 21. I entered the contract on April 25. Well 2 days ago I got a notification that said my contract was assigned and I no longer had the shares and lost $2.00 per share or something like that. I guess what I’m asking is what makes a contract get assigned? I was under the impression that the stock would have to fall to $2.50 for the buyer to exercise their end to buy my shares and if the stock did not fall to $2.50 then the contract would expire worthless by the 21st and I would keep my 100 shares and the premium.

Colonial is going to have a crucial test tonight to see if the pipeline will reopen on Friday. I am sceptical.

United States Gas is a solid play today. Prices goes up the fund goes up. Call premiums at $1.15. Volume of shares traded at 115k a day. That isn't a typo. 115k. Not million.

Nobody likes to see rising gas prices. However if it is going to happen let's profit. If everything turns out fine we close position. Break even.

Renewables are just not there yet, neither is battery tech.  The market knows this, and govt. subsidies only go so far to push it.  

Nuclear energy, even if it is ""the future"", is at least 30 years out at best.  Worst, we probably won't even see it in our lifetimes.

NG is the best compromise and is replacing coal worldwide as countries develop.

Thus, I bring to you SWN:

Trading at $5 now, was $50 in the past.  When NG prices shoot up, SWN will go INSANE.

It has no maturities until 2025 and positive free cash flow with proved reserves of 15 tcf and a total enterprise value 5.5 billion which is only about 40 cents per thousand cubic feet, which translates to $ 2.40 per barrel of oil equivalent.   It has been destroyed over the last 4 years by Wall Street shorts and all nat gas producers have been savaged by the Wall Street analysts for Morgan Stanley etc.  especially Morgan Stanley.   Nat gas has been in a bear market since 2008 but with the destruction of the space last year there has been a collapse in drilling and there isn’t even oil drilling which used to bring associated gas with it.   

Gas demand is still surging both as a power plant fuel replacing coal and export of lng to places like China where it’s been cold as shit.   NG was recently going for $30 per thousand cubic feet in China lng market while trading at 2.75 here.  Can’t go on forever.

Printing money just adds fuel to fire

naccw1,,wallstreetbets,post,1620780353,"$WELL $WLYYF | WELL Health TA Follow Up - Record Earnings ReportedHey guys, after my last post got some great feedback and people seemed to be getting value out of it I decided to do a follow up today as the company posted record earnings today. 

Beyond the obvious, that is significant to me for 3 core reasons. 

1. It's a direct sign that the companies aggressive M&A Activity is paying off
2. Building a strong support on the 200day sma.
3. Morning action shook out weak hands & Traders 

We saw a typical sell the news event this morning as the bears won the morning session but that didn't last long as the bulls came in strong and took the final victory closing near the HOD. 

Diving into the charts, I still believe we are in a very similar area to March of 2020 for 2 main reasons. 

1. The company started announcing aggressive M&A activity at that time which they are doing again at scale now. 
2. The technicals are lining up to be nearly identical after this consolidation in the $7-$8 range. 

Again, zooming out here I am seeing a few interesting things immediately. I still believe WELL is forming a large flag and potentially an ascending triangle after the long consolidation and 2 most recent closes. The RSI forming a double bottom followed by a higher low + volume increase would further suggest that it could be close to a major breakout out of this range. It needs to now build support above the 50 day sma just below $8 to finally breakout above this range. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x8sltapc2ly61.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9ba06283c65f608408fb4fe97e5048041f0f74

Prior to March 2020 the company saw a major consolidation period followed by a slight downturn with the rest of the market which led to a run from $2- $4 - $6 - $8 and beyond. Again we are saying a major consolidation period followed by a slight downturn in the market with a huge increase in M&A activity which ultimately led to the last huge breakout which would put us at $7 - $14 - $21 - $28 respectively. 

Not to mention, the RSI has not been this low since that date and we are now seeing it coil up again further signalling a potential breakout coming. Especially with the short interest on it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a53d8npi2ly61.png?width=2708&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c92d0a2744627155ffcc001ee2dffd406c1d27f

Zooming in slightly, we see the 04/23 low set the bottom but also saw it closing on the 200day SMA. Since that day, WELL has made higher lows and has again closed above the 200day SMA when tested with it. Confluences in the RSI as well as we saw the double bottom followed by a higher low.  I think we have a strong support at this level and are making a strong base for the next major move up. 

&#x200B;

Now let's get into what you degens really care about - short term price action. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/34mg6m5r2ly61.png?width=2418&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0fb84fd7afc703c36c55f23d13a97ec0e9981e

Since 04/23 WELL has been forming a large bull flag that it looks ready to break out of. As the market took a turn it naturally followed and was unable to break above the 200sma on any day until yesterday when it closed strong above it.

 Like I said, this morning seemed like a typical sell the news event but that only makes me more bullish, look how strong it wicked at the 50 day SMA after being pushed below the 20day- The selling pressure was gone in 30 minutes and the bulls controlled the rest of the session putting it again above the 20 & 200day SMA for a strong close and base for a potentially great week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rd4c7b23ly61.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&s=392757dff50970cdac9d7495a7511fdb07c8fd31

I have a feeling some shorts were pissed! WELL was closing near the HOD before someone decided to sell off into the bid to show a red close. I laugh at these attempts, I think the shorts just do it so they can sleep better at night because even they must know it does nothing besides help us tomorrow. Especially since it put us right on the 20day SMA. STRONG CLOSE. 

Now to look for similarities... 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qld255qd3ly61.png?width=2596&format=png&auto=webp&s=0398301d004ba47bc17b53a60ed9919e2acdddbe

Zooming back out, we see confluences on the daily as the 200day SMA turned into strong support with the 20 & 50 day sma left to hit. If that trend line extended it would be 7.4 and that 50day SMA sits around 7.6 - This is where I think the next support will be. 

I believe that with todays strong price action after a relatively weak morning, and the bullish divergence in the RSI which is still below 50% but heading in the right direction that WELL is going to turn this short term resistance into support and finally break out of this $8 range once and for all. 

https://preview.redd.it/bbwcq3ay1ly61.png?width=2188&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9653123b713956fbce097fc9d3eb2edad465fde

Once that $7.6-7.8 level becomes support (50daySMA) I think it's going to be a quick break through $8 as it did when the stock broke through $2 for the first time. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0e9tq2064ly61.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=012bf6ab79db458ef53db8083da51efba2766b66

Aside from all the other reasons I believe the stock is in a similar position to March 2020 it is also having its first green week in what was mostly red which was the clear turnaround (1st green week) that took WELL from under $2 to just under $4 in a few months. 

I'm no genius but I do spend a damn long time looking at charts and coming up with these ideas and hope that it inspires others to do the same regardless if i'm right or wrong. 

Just about everything here is telling me that WELL is about to see that $2-$4-$6-$8 + style move but this time from $7-$14-$21-$28 and beyond... Which I admit sounds a bit crazy but as one of the people on my last post mentioned, the ceo has publicly stated that he thinks this will be a $50bn company so that would be a double from those levels lol.

nabaik,,wallstreetbets,post,1620777004,"PLTR DD PART 2Suppers ready

Good news for some of you on the PLTR earnings report. I suppose you'll be interested in knowing what happened to the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/qwsurb22tky61.jpg?width=1057&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093e0d476e651e4bcece86ae9f8b96238e4a374a

Here we see some squiggles. It shows that the stock's underlying price movement is becoming less influenced by Gamma and more by \*insert hand waves\* other factors. What other factors? Wouldn't you like to know. But typically gamma is healthy so I wonder if the other factors are less so.

So then we look at the short interest volume. With such a large price jump - did people increase short selling or decrease? Were these shorts a part of options dealings? Were they MM shorting in the dark market? Who knows.

https://preview.redd.it/u9vivncftky61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da7488cc42dde49754c6ba599ac23cb6c33dcf11

Slight increase but I wouldn't say uber substantial. But it definitely isn't a decrease.

Looking at the options:

https://preview.redd.it/pk3sz1mqtky61.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b44948c90a0f58bd3122e7f15d1f45cfef5fe27c

With a larger-than-expected increase in price, lots of options switched hands, mainly at the $20 at which \~150,000 calls became ITM and \~200,000 puts became OTM. Oof to those bag holders.

But the real interest is in how the options landscape changed. Yesterday's options:/

https://preview.redd.it/hbdu3y31uky61.jpg?width=1047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccca5e3d569161e72bccbc00112a259a570487d2

 Todays:

https://preview.redd.it/7wd5k0d6uky61.jpg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ba558de8d8847a3e71482faedf7e27595ea7311

Accounting for the switching of ITM/OTM you'll see a decent increase in calls (\~160k) and puts (\~118k). Since overall delta exposure doubled towards zero it can be said that the majority of those were dealer long and customer short. This is healthy behavior. Considering volatility dropped as well, this suggests continued upside. 

It seems as though the healthy earnings report re-vitalized the stock. There is still rocky ground, however, there may be resistance at $20 but with increased liquidity and stabilizing gamma, there is an argument to be made that it should go beyond. 

The caveat is that if there is downside if it starts causing liquidity issues again the stock may continue its previous trajectory until the options landscape changes more drastically. With okayish accuracy, you can see with increase in volatility, 1.6mil options will have to be hedged via purchasing underlying with 1.8mil via selling. So back to the 1.6:1.8 as before. (For those wondering, did the decrease in volatility today help the stock rise with 1.6million options needing hedging via purchasing with decrease in vol? or was it the prospect of tendies. Lemme know).

TL;DR: You deserve your tendies today but dont let them get cold.",

na85cz,,wallstreetbets,post,1620768246,"Negative Real Rates will go into uncharted territory tomorrow. New highs for Gold and Silver imminent!!! Real Rates are the number one driver for precious metals. (DD)\-Tomorrow morning the BLS will release the monthly inflation numbers for April, Annual CPI is currently at 2.6%. The consensus is that Annual CPI will go up to 3.6% tomorrow morning. I think that the number is going to be closer to 4% . Even with a 10 year yield going up to 2% that gives a negative real rate of -2, which we haven't seen in a very long time. Here are some graphs illustrating what I am saying.

&#x200B;

**Here is the monthly inflation numbers, as of tomorrow that -0.7 comes off of the board and it takes CPI up to 3.3% . I would expect the April number to be higher than the March number of .6, Inflation is heating up, so I am not sure why they would expect a lower number in the consensus, that would then add onto to the 3.3% and give us a CPI of 4%. As you can see this is going to build on itself into the year.**

&#x200B;

**As you can see in the chart above , every time the real rates touch zero or go below that line, historically that has been a bullish time for precious metals. 2011 was a great run for the metals and as you can see rates went below that line. 2016 was another good run for the metals as it touched the breakeven line. And of course there is last year where we went all the way down to negative -1, which is where we are now.**

\-Yields are going to want to rise on this inflation news tomorrow, and I expect the markets to tank pretty quickly, but as you can see with the new inflation numbers that the real rates will be much lower. The metals should in theory explode in the coming weeks.

\-This is where the fed might implement yield curve control or choose let the economy collapse. I guess we will find out soon

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?",

FUBO was caught in the Archegos drama and has had their SP literally crushed in the past few weeks.

Before the HwangBang there was a reporting error that sent the SP dropping into Gulag. The previous report didnt factor in GAAP and also did not take into account dilution, resulting in a dramatically high EPS miss. Even with massive sub growth larger than ROKU and NFLX they got their shit kicked in.

Now, the company has been in a ""quiet period"" for weeks, meaning they cannot comment on anything regarding acquisitions or any material information until the period is over per SEC rules.

That period ends in 45 mins.

FUBO is the number 1 sports streaming platform, and is rolling out sports betting in Q4, and has the most impressive sub growth of all streaming services % wise. Theyre introducing original content to offer alongside Live TV.

ALL analysts covering the stock are projecting $40-$60 and institutional buying is the highest ive ever seen in the last 2 months on any stock.

&#x200B;

Theyre presenting at the Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference on 5/17. Theyre edge over DKNG is that they can legally share all analytics they collect via their betting platform, which DKNG cannot do via privacy laws since theyre technically a 3rd party, whereas FUBO does it in house.

Possession of alien craft therefore seems like material information which is required to be disclosed to shareholders. Lack of craft possession also seems like a material risk if anyone else has one. 

Are there any securities attorneys out there? Is it even worth it to ask the company for the information?

Lockheed has an investor relations page that has contact information, but I want feedback on this if they respond with “internal trade secrets” or something.

To those who bought in on my previous post congratulations! For those of you who have yet to buy in let me give you some more Information as to why you should. My position is 237 shares and 20 call options spread throughout the year.

Ill point you to the same chart I did last time [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) as you can see it still shows 0 sign of slowing down anytime soon. But aside from this chart lets talk about some recent events to prove why this chart is true.

&#x200B;

**Berkshire hathaway share holder meeting**

Warren Buffet himself talked about how they keep seeing raising commodity prices. He talked about how steel prices kept going up everyday. He used the example that general motors has to keep paying more for steel everyday. He said the economy is red hot!

**China steel rebate officially drops to 0%**

[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) previously I spoke about how China was just talking about this being a possibility of this happening. However this has now happened. It being so recent it has yet to really have a massive effect on steel trade. However as the last of many companies steel reserves go empty they are going to have to eventually purchase more from China. This will not only increase China's export profitability since many countries were trying to compete with China's steel prices they will no longer have to and be able to keep marking prices up as the super cycle continues through the year. No more price competition on steel will simply drive prices further through the roof since ""cheap steel"" no longer exists.

**Steel demand continually on the rise while supply cannot keep up with demand.**

[https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand-growth-forecast-to-5-8/) Another very recent article talking about how steel demand is affecting multiple sectors in the industry. Covid-19 put a large halt on steel demand now that the great reopening is happening across many countries demand is revving up as steel mills have to ramp up production to the nines because they did not produce as heavily in a low demand market.

**Summer construction season.**

Many roads and bridges as we all know are worked on exclusively in the summer months. Not many companies have large reserves of rebar just lying around. As time goes on the prices are only going to go higher. These companies will have no choice other than to pay these ridiculous prices. Creating stronger demand as we go into these summer months.

**CLF beat Q1 earnings expectations**

Just a little icing on the cake [https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland](https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland/news/2021/04/22/cleveland-cliffs.html) they beat expected earnings by 2 cents EPS. Next quarter is expected to be even higher please stay tuned!","['BRK.B', 'GM']"
