lv5dlb,gpbcy3e,stocks,comment,1614617395,"Swedish investor here. Been investing for about four years now. I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial.

n8zkio,,stocks,post,1620635704,"PSFE (Paysafe): A better way to bet on multiple high growth companies like DRAFTKINGS, BARSTOOL, FORTNITE, TWITCH, YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, ETC.Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including discussion of bear cases, so I’m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don’t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it’s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it’s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - “Penn National’s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.” ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )
2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - “DraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance”

(Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )

3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- “Revenue increased 16% to €2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from €1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year….” (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))

4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - “ In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter — up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That’s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It’s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )

5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - “Revenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.” (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )

As you can see these Paysafe’s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer’s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe’s future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet. These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) “ Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) “Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.” ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don’t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

In summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has. This is a massive high growth area and they own the space. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

n8zkio,gxlkuix,stocks,comment,1620648597,"Can you point me to the articles that show that they have ApplePay and Visa as customers? Also, having Youtube/Google as a customer sounds great, but you can only use a paysafecard to buy a subscription, which doesn't ad much revenue/volume would be my guess. (I just checked, same goes for Spotify and I can't even use it in my country, which is in Europe, were Paysafe is used the most). 

On top of that: lack of revenue seems to be the main issue with Paysafe, which doesn't seem to get adressed that much. They expect $1.8 billion in revenue by 2023, while they had over $1 billion in rev for the first time in 2016. That's less than 10% CAGR, which really isn't that great.",['GOOGL']

n9680h,,stocks,post,1620657353,"DD: $IRBT - The Dust Has Settled**Note:** Before reading, consider if I'm worth my salt. Here's an overview of my performance since I started posting Stock Analysis to reddit: https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7. Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

**Intro:** iRobot = Roomba, got it? It's really that simple. It's a household name brand that sells their robot vacuums, as well as automatic floor mopping robots, a robot that teaches kids to code(this speaks directly to my heart), and their new robotic lawn mower. Incorporated in 1990, Headquartered in Massachusetts, blah, blah, blah. 

**Bear case:** Yeah, we're going to do this analysis a little differently. 

There have been a few good threads examining IRBT, most of which have the same few comments and criticisms. 

1. ""There are so many low cost alternatives to the Roomba, iRobot has no chance at maintaining market leadership."" This isn't wrong, only... it kind of is. iRobot has been stating this for literally *years* in their 10Ks. They know it exists. There *are* low cost alternatives that reduce the quality vs price trade-off, but this does 2 things:
 * Creates a race to the bottom effect between low cost manufacturers thus competition grows between *them* just to survive. This reduces overall profitability of low cost brands and removes them from the market sooner.
 * Hurts the robovac industry *short term* as people purchase these low quality products, realize they're not super effective, and decide to just stick with a regular vacuum in the future. 

2. ""IRBT has failed to capitalize on their technology or to expand."" First of all, they lead the market in their technology and I don't mean ahead of the aforementioned discount brands, I mean against Samsung, Shark, and other major players in the household cleaning industry that have been established *for years.* They are specialists, through and through. Their process is slow and deliberate and that's *exactly* why they'll maintain their market edge. Admittedly, this is exactly what frustrates investors- the lack of perceived growth in a time when every other tech-centric consumer good is gaining momentum- and I love iRobot for this.

3.    ""IRBT stock price hasn't really moved much."" If you're investing based on stock price movement, you're not investing at all. But since I know that's not helpful, fine, the price has about tripled in the last 5 years.

Alright, I admit that the above Bear case was only used to illustrate some rebuttals to common arguments against IRBT. It's important to consider that just because I disagree with the arguments above, doesn't mean that the rest of the market does as well. Public sentiment is always a factor when considering investments and I realize that right now I'm betting against the above arguments. Below, I will get further into some of my subjective analysis that further defends this thesis.

**Metrics:**

1. **P/E** of 16. I know, everyone is hating on the P/E ratio lately, but it's still a valuable indicator of a company's performance whether we like it or not. Ok, so a P/E of 16 is reasonable at least, especially considering today's current max market P/E or Sharpe ratio. But that's not even why I'm mentioning it. If we exclude last year's COVID crisis effect on the market, iRobot's P/E ratio has *never* ***ever*** been this low. Now that's not to say it can't go lower, but I don't think I've ever seen a strong, high functioning company been as undervalued compared to itself as iRobot is right now. (MacroTrends)
2. **PEG ratio**, as a result of the above, is an absurd .89 if dividing P/E by the projected next 5 years of earnings growth. What's great about this is that that's *a low end estimate* for earnings growth. IRBT saw an earnings growth of 73% over the TTM, is projected for a 62% EPS growth over the coming year, and even their past 5 years show a 28.5% EPS growth. Dividing the P/E by any of those numbers makes the undervaluation theory *even stronger*. It's absurd how undervalued this is right now. (Finviz)
3. **Debt:** Zero debt, but I did want to mention this for a specific reason. When a company lacks *any* debt, it's perceived that growth is limited if financial leverage isn't being used. This is understandable, but I think that iRobot has found a middle ground between funding new projects with their own cash and maintaining a ridiculously healthy balance sheet.
4. **Other Basics:** Revenue, gross revenue, and Cash Flow from Operations has continued to climb steadily year after year. Their product lineup might not be growing, but they sure as Heck are growing stronger financially over time. Also, their entire cash position outweighs their entire Liabilities column on the Balance Sheet- how can you not love that?

5. **Institutional Ownership** is 100%. There's no real room here. This shows confidence in the company, but prevents major moves upward by a new, big interested buyer to jump the price significantly. It also brings along the potential risk of a major move down if an Institution decides it wants to pull out. What compounds this issue is that there's only about 28 million shares of iRobot to go around and while they have issued buybacks to reduce this amount, which is good for investors, it can also be very scary during tumultuous times. 

**Subjective analysis:** I love but had the concern going into this that the company hasn't ""grown"" in a few years. After looking through their financial statements, I've been proven wrong. As a matter of fact, they've proven me wrong time and time again when trying to find cracks in the armor. I was hoping that perception of their product lineup was poor- it's not. Even with Samsung being in the same market as them since 2014, Roomba has *crushed* their competition and it's partly because the customer base believes in them. I then turned my attention to employee sentiment -that too was a dead end. Glassdoor shows raves reviews for iRobot. People like working there.

Warren Buffett has said(yes, I know, the entirety of reddit quotes him but today this is extra applicable to this thesis) that there might be a thousand people who don't agree with your investing opinion- and that's fine. As it stands now, I don't think many people perceive iRobot as a company with the growth momentum of a rocket ship. Putting myself in the perspective of a business owner, which is what you become the moment you hit the 'Place Buy Order' button, has made me realize that I would love to own this business. It's a profitable leader in a market segment that has the *ability* to expand further into the quickly growing tech and robotics industries, but doesn't *rely* on them. So if the haters hate then let them hate, and watch the money pile up.

n9680h,gxm7yx7,stocks,comment,1620660103,"Not long on iRBT.

I am a professional product developer and one of the things I have developed in the past: Robot vacuums.

Some things you may not know.

1. I robot actually licenses their older design patents to competitors on the open market.

Some of the discounter designs are literally just knock-offs of older Roomba's patents/designs.

I don't believe in Roomba long-term and here is why:

Those generics offer similar performance at a lower price compared to Roomba.

I had one of each (remember this is 2019 and not current) and was testing designs to see which one we should patent-design around (basically deciding which design type is best then knocking it off in a way that does not legally violate patents).

The patents Roomba leased were kind of forced. Their technology was 100% stolen and dumped onto the Chinese market so they pursued litigation and took a check for licensing deal since it was already publicly available. This includes source code and includes pretty much everything except the vacuum cleaning patterns (stored in the hardware, but was actively being dumped in an effort to decode).

In the end, the generics performed very close to Roomba in every test except pattern logic (the patterns the Roomba takes are superior to the Chinese ones but cleaning efficacy is nearly identical).

I see Roomba has squandered its position as market leader and spent most of its money on advertising for short-term sales and doesn't really appear to be staying ahead as far as performance, R&D, and technology.

My info is a bit old (2019ish) but I have to say that Roomba seemed like its days were numbered due to competition catching up FAST using Roomba's very own technology as a springboard aginst them.",

The longest portion, a 40-year security, may yield around 115 basis points over Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.

Amazon has been a fairly infrequent issuer, but it comes in big on those rare occasions. It last tapped the bond market in June 2020, borrowing $10 billion for general corporate purposes. Prior to that, it sold $16 billion of bonds in 2017 to help finance its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc.

The proceeds of Monday’s offering will be for general corporate purposes, which may also include acquisitions and working capital, said the person. The two-year bond will be allocated for eligible green or social projects.

n95ls5,,stocks,post,1620656295,"APD - A company set to dominate the Hydrogen business (but not reliant)I've been into Hydrogen for quite a while, and I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. $2/kg is considered a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

What are the current uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (It costs $4k to get a projected market size, I aint paying that shit, but for reference here's what wikipedia has to say: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

I listened into their conference call today to see what had to be said, and some very interesting points were made, that puts my bullish stance far higher. There is a lot of debate on the efficacy of green hydrogen. The argument is that its inefficient. Well, APD have aims to become the leaders of Blue Hydrogen, alongside their efforts to produce green hydrogen. Now, what is blue hydrogen many may ask. Well blue hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced using natural gas, with the CO2 emissions generated during the process being captured and stored. I plan on sending an email to investor relations to see if I can get more details on this, as I'm aware they sell CO2 and CO, but this development puts me very bullish on the company, as this would be an efficient way to produce hydrogen with low environmental impact. Blue Hydrogen is not a dream either. I posted yesterday on the Dutch Government's subsidies for a carbon capture project, which directly benefited APD. Carbon capture is already a reality. 

Another thing said during the conference call was that they're very bullish on is high purity Nitrogen in the electronics market. They've earned a lot of contracts, although some of them they cannot announce for client privacy reasons. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted 46% of sales in 2020, while hydrogen, syngas and related products constituted 22% of sales. Evidently they don't rely on hydrogen for revenue, but being the leading provider, they put themselves in a good position to profit heavily from the eventual move to hydrogen

 A lot of interesting questions were answered in the conference call, which I suggest anyone thinking about investing having read this should listen to. I've said it for quite a while, and I'll continue to say it, but hydrogen is the future for the majority of industries, and the safest investment you can make into hydrogen is APD, they have insanely strong earnings to their name (11% CAGR), and offer a 2% dividend as an added benefit of holding shares. They don't do any stock buybacks, but I'm completely fine with that. P/E of about 34, and earnings are not affected by any rises in natural gas (Their customers subsidise the cost of natural gas). 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but do they have room to fucking grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it.",['APD']

n95ls5,gxm9ygl,stocks,comment,1620660962,Interesting point about blue vs green hydrogen. I think green hydrogen is inefficient in comparison since you're taking solar and wind power as electricity and using it to create hydrogen through process like hydrolysis. Blue hydrogen you're using fossil fuels separating the hydrogen from the hydrocarbons. The idea is that youre better off just using the electricity from the green tech but the blue hydrogen is a clean alternative for fossil fuel use. I'm not sure on the efficiency of blue hydrogen vs straight fossil fuels but I don't think that matters considering the way policy is going. Hydrogen regardless is going to be a huge part of our future in energy.,

n8lkh6,,stocks,post,1620588678,"The love/hate mating dance of Cathie Wood (ARK) with this subreddit, her take on this correction and her strategy going forwardPreface: I'm **not** invested in any ARK funds myself. I do hold some of the stocks in her funds.

Loved by most of this subreddit in 2020. Hated by most in 2021. Yikes. In the past 3 months, correlating with the sharp drop in most of her funds (Most of them have dropped 30%+ since February), more and more people have started critizing ARK. ARK has seen outflows of more than $750 million in the last week. Now, everyone has a different take on whether her stock picks will do well or not, that's fine. I think we can all agree that 2020 has been an extraordinary year, with growth / tech / speculative stocks being the absolute winners of this mad year, mostly due to historically never before seen low interest rates, but also affected by a huge in-flow of new investors, support packages which are focused on certain sectors (Clean energy for example). More traditional sectors have underperformed last year, yet we've been seeing an institutional rotation away from speculative stocks into more value oriented names. 

However, let's not forget that pretty much all ARK funds are still up 300%+ up from the beginning of 2020. And while the sectors ARK is heavily invested in outperformed hard, they are most likely primed to underperform this year as institutions rotated away with interest rates picking back up and the global economy slowly opening again. Is this a problem though? No. 300% in a year is insanity. This is a healthy correction. And while it may hurt seeing your portfolio like this, this is a good moment to remember why you invested the way you did (and also a good moment for self-reflection). 

Whether the criticism she's getting lately is deserved, i'll leave that up for debate. Some of her picks are HIGHLY questionable in my opinion, yet i also see some as primed for explosive growth in the upcoming 5/10 years. She has also received a lot of criticism on here for selling her bigger blue chip stocks. Is this warranted? How does she view this correction?   


“I love this setup,” she said Friday on CNBC’. “The worst thing that could have happened to us is to have the market narrowly focus on just our ilk of stock — the innovation space. From our point of view — five-year time horizon — nothing has changed except the price,” she said. Back in February, Wood expected a 15% compound annual rate of return from her strategies, but after the recent fall in prices, she envisions that number rising to between 25% and 30%.""

In other words, she welcomes this. Now, obviously she would not say this is a disaster, as she is the fund manager. But there is also truth to her statement. Now, why does she love this setup? She sees this as an amazing buying opportunity, now that prices have dropped. But where does she get the money from? Mainly her blue chips, which is heavily debated on this sub.

 “The FAANGs certainly meet that criteria — they’re acting like defensives,” she said. “During a period of volatility like we’ve just seen, we will sell those stocks and move into either our more pure-play or earlier-stage innovation companies that are being hurt by risk-off.”  

I actually wrote a quite comprehensive piece on this (on this subreddit as well), diving deeper into her strategy, and how she exectutes this. To read more about this, click [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mtb0kc/analyzing_cathie_woods_ark_strategy_in_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

Let's not forget that most people (even fund managers) do not beat the market over a long term (and even less on a risk-adjusted basis). ARK funds have outperformed in 2020, and will most likely underperform in the short term. Whether it will underperform in the long term, who knows. Imo, she has some holdings that i do not see a future in, and her projections and valuations are... Rich to say the least. But let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy. It's also possible that this correction gives her the ability to make changes in her portfolio's for favorable prices, and thus makes higher returns possible. 

This is not financial advice. Do your own research.

n94gwe,,stocks,post,1620653388,"CELZ tech has incredible undiscovered potentialCreative Medical Technology Holdings $CELZ is a company I encourage everyone to look into. Founded by Dr. Amit Patel, the inventor of Jadicell, the company is engaged in stem cell research to treat common abundant diseases that impact the world's population.

The company has filed an IND application with the FDA on its newest technology, ImmCelz, for the treatment of stroke. The FDA requested more information in March, which the company provided in April, and it is now awaiting FDA approval to begin clinical trials. 

ImmCelz could revolutionize the treatment of far-reaching, common diseases such as stroke, liver failure, kidney failure, heart attack, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and transplant rejection. The invention of Dr. Amit Patel and Dr. Thomas Ichim, ImmCelz treatment involves utilization of allogenic Jadicell stem cells outside of the body to ""reprogram"" the patient's own immune cells so as to endow upon the immune cells regenerative activities. The company believes that ""educated"" immune cells may be superior to stem cells because of their: a) ability to replicate and form ""memory"" cells; b) substantially smaller size, which allows for superior biodistribution than stem cells; and c) adeptness at surviving in conditions such as hypoxia or acidosis, which would inactivate stem cells. Preclinical trials have shown an 85% increased improvement with ImmCelz versus the use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of stroke. 

Once FDA approval is received to begin clinical trials for the treatment of stroke, the company intends to file other IND applications for ImmCelz based on positive preclinical results in treating the common diseases mentioned earlier. Annually, these are all multi-billion dollar areas. The ability to provide a non-pharma, one-time procedure for those affected by these diseases is a game changer. 
https://immcelz.com/ 

The company has recently brought on renowned kidney specialist, Dr. Caigan Du, and clinical trial expert, Dr. Boris Reznik, to its scientific advisory board. These recruitments demonstrate the direction the company is headed to capitalize on the groundbreaking technology they have developed. 

The company has already commercialized autologous mesenchymal stem cell technology to treat erectile disfunction, called CaverStem, and another to treat female sexual disfunction, called FemCelz. The treatments are currently available in 14 markets (13 US, 1 Italy). www.caverstem.com 
www.femcelz.com 

Additionally, the company is in the process of commercializing more of the same autologous mesenchymal stem cell technology to treat degenerative disc disease, called StemSpine. The company has published data from the results of the first 15 patients treated with StemSpine. The mean pain changed from 8.9 at baseline to 4.3 at 30 days and sustained to 1.8 at 6 months and 1.3 at 12 months with a gradual reduction in overall pain medication utilization guided by their healthcare team. This data shows the potential this one-time treatment offers those suffering from degenerative disc disease.

This is an OTC penny stock, so don't expect strong financials and realize there is volatility. I think this company has amazing potential as a long-term investment. I think it will go from pennies now to dollars in 2022. I want to create awareness so that others have a chance to get in early too. Do your DD!

Article for those who want a quick scroll. Companys that benefit from this are Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Air Products and Chemicals, and Air Liquide.

The Dutch government has granted a consortium that includes oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) around 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in subsidies for what is set to become one of the largest carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the world, the Port of Rotterdam said on Sunday.

Shell and Exxon requested the subsidies in January together with industrial gas suppliers Air Liquide and Air Products (APD.N) for a project which aims to capture CO2 emitted by factories and refineries in the Rotterdam port area and store it in empty Dutch gas fields in the North Sea. read more

The companies involved have been told that their applications will be granted, port spokesman Sjaak Poppe told Reuters, confirming an earlier report by Dutch public broadcaster NOS.

This clears the most important hurdle for the project, which is set to become operational in 2024 and is expected to reduce emissions in the industrial cluster surrounding Europe's largest sea port by around 10%.

Economy ministry spokesman Dion Huidekooper declined to comment on the reports on Sunday evening.

Details of the subsidies would be made public after decisions had been taken on all applications for this year, he said, which was expected to happen later this month.

The government has said it will grant a total of 5 billion euros in subsidies in 2021 for technologies that will help it achieve its climate goals.

It received applications for a total sum of 6.4 billion euros.

The CCS subsidies are meant to compensate the companies for the extra costs of capturing the greenhouse gasses instead of emitting them, while the port will provide the necessary infrastructure to transport the carbon dioxide to the empty offshore gas fields.

Home to many large industries and Europe's main seaport, the Netherlands is among the countries with the highest emissions of greenhouse gasses per capita in Europe.

It aims to lower emissions by 55% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. Emissions were down 24.5% from 1990 levels last year.


Now I'm not sure how big a benefit this will be, but I do know the likes of Air Products and Chemicals sell CO2. Excluding the subsidy, if they can capitalise on this, they may be able to use it as a steady source of revenue, but if this proves a successful method of reducing carbon, I feel like a lot of factories will jump to this over switching energy sources, as it would save them a lot of work.

People will then have to spend most of the money they got from stimulus check/social support they got from the government, which would drive up the demand for goods and services. This increase in demand would also increase the prices of goods.  I was wondering how do you guys prepare for inflation. Should I liquidate all my stocks at a loss and then buy assets that protect against inflation? Or should I just hold them for the long term like I was supposed to do?

n99191,,stocks,post,1620663389,"Betterware de Mexico: SaaS growth @ automotive (ICE lol) valuation**- Company & Investment Overview -**

Betterware de Mexico is a leading direct-to-consumer marketplace and platform business in Mexico that sells home organization and cleaning products. It is the first Mexican company to ever directly list on the NASDAQ. Betterware’s product portfolio falls under 6 categories (ranked according to % of sales): kitchen (35%), home (20%), bathroom (12%), laundry & cleaning (11%), commuting (11%), and bedroom (11%). The company sells its products through a unique two-tier sales model that consists of 59,700+ distributors and 1.2+ million associates with a 20% household penetration across Mexico.

Betterware has 60% gross margins and returns on tangible capital, generates abundant free cash flow, and pays a 4% dividend. The business grew at over 50% annualized over the last 5 years and generated $350 million in revenue and $77 million in net income in 2020. The founding family oversees operations and owns half of the company, a stake worth over $750 million USD. The company is expected to continue growing well above 40% a year for the next several years thanks to a long growth runway remaining in Mexico and nearby Latin American countries. The stock trades at a very undervalued 14x earnings at a $1.7 billion market cap due to lack of investor awareness. We believe the company is worth at least 100% to 150% more.

**- Business History -**

Betterware began as the Mexican subsidiary of the British company Betterware Limited. Betterware Limited sold a variety of household products in the UK and decided to expand into Latin America. Unfortunately, the venture performed poorly because the British parent did not tailor the business model to fit Latin America’s unique cultural and demographic characteristics (which will be explained later). This created the opportunity that led to Luis Campos, Betterware de Mexico’s current chairman and 50% owner, acquiring this subsidiary and establishing it as Betterware de Mexico. Mr. Campos was uniquely positioned to revitalize this distressed company due to his extensive background in consumer goods businesses in Latin America. His storied career included being the former chairman at various multinational corporations, including Hasbro Mexico, Sara Lee Mexico, and Tupperware Americas. Mr. Campos completely reshaped the business to fit Latin American culture and laid the groundwork that enabled the company to achieve its spectacular future results.

Under his leadership, Betterware’s revenue and EBITDA grew over 60-fold and 120-fold, respectively, over the last twenty years (23%+ annualized). In addition, the company’s distribution network grew from 200 distributors to over 59,000 and from 5,000 associates to over 1.2 million. In March 2020, the company went public via special purpose acquisition company. Dr. Martin Werner, the former head of Goldman Sachs’s LatAm investment banking division, led the deal. In its first calendar year as a public company (2020), Betterware grew revenues by 130% and EBITDA by 147%. The business’s growth, profitability, and execution have been stellar under Campos’s oversight. Looking ahead, Betterware is aiming to expand globally, starting with other Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, and Colombia.

**- Business Model & Competitive Advantages -**

As mentioned earlier, Betterware employs a direct-to-consumer sales strategy. In contrast, in traditional retail, products move in the following sequence: manufacturer → wholesaler → distributor → retailer → customer. Betterware’s model involves none of these middlemen or external parties between the company and its customers. As a result, the company is able to offer extremely affordable prices across its product portfolio (average item price is $5). Customers order products, and Betterware controls the entire process ranging from manufacturing to distribution (via the distributors and associates) to the final product sale. Betterware designs products in-house, manufactures them in Asia, and delivers them to distributors. Both distributors and associates deliver the products directly to the customer. This allows the company to minimize its shipping and last-mile delivery costs. 

Betterware sells its products through 9 catalogs a year that are published roughly every 6 weeks. The catalog is accessible via a 100-page physical booklet, the e-commerce site ([https://www.betterware.com.mx/mx/es/](https://www.betterware.com.mx/mx/es/)), and the iOS/Android app. The firm is constantly innovating and introduces around 300 new products each year while replacing underperforming products. The e-commerce site launched in December 2020 and helped accelerate sales that month by 301% YoY and EBITDA by 417% YoY.

Products are delivered from the company’s distribution center to the distributor through whom the order was placed. The distributor has groups of associates who work for them, and the associates deliver the products to the customer. Therefore, the company itself has 0 last mile delivery costs, as its distributors and associates deliver the products to the final consumers. This is one key competitive advantage in Mexico due to last-mile delivery costs being exorbitant, especially to rural areas.

Four other factors further solidify Betterware’s competitive position in the market:

First, Betterware offers payment flexibility by accepting both cash and credit. 70% of transactions in Mexico are made in cash, while only 30% are made on credit. In addition, less than a third of Mexicans have a bank account and even less use a debit or credit card. This makes the ability to accept cash important, as well as problematic for many other e-commerce retailers who have attempted expansion in Mexico and Latin America. At the same time, the ability to pay via credit on Betterware’s e-commerce site is also important because it allows the company to have direct exposure to the trend of financial transactions becoming increasingly digital around the world.

Second, the company’s platform continues to grow in its scale and reach over time. The firm has grown at over 20%+ annualized for 2 decades, with annual growth accelerating in the past 5 years in excess of 40%. With 1.3 million total distributors and associates, Betterware products are now sold by nearly 1.5% of Mexico’s working population. As more people continue to buy products, the company is also able to better introduce new items that will be in demand thanks to the ability to analyze the millions of transactions taking place.

Third, the business performs exceptionally well during economic downturns. Many Mexican residents become associates or distributors to earn additional income during a recession. Furthermore, due to the low average product sales price, customers are likely to cut other areas of spending from their budgets before reducing their Betterware purchases. As a result of these two attributes, the business model is extremely resilient to recessions.

Last but not least, Betterware is run by a high quality founder-led management team. The Campos family owns 18,438,770 shares, a 50.1% stake worth over $700 million USD today. They have not sold a single share since the company went public, despite the value of their stake rising from \~$144 million. Additionally, the Campos family takes no compensation directly from the company. Instead, their entire $33 million USD annual income is derived from the company’s dividends. Because of this, the Campos family is aligned with the interests of current shareholders.

**- Cultural & Geographic Relevance -**

Betterware’s business model is tailored to perfectly fit Mexico’s unique cultural and geographical dynamics. For starters, family is one of the most important elements in Mexican society and is an essential safety net of help and protection. Families are typically large, especially in the rural communities that dominate Mexico’s population. Furthermore, decorating and maintaining a home is very important, as family gatherings are a large part of Mexican life.

These characteristics point us back to the two reasons why the British sales model was ineffective. First, their approach was impersonal. Associates were assigned to specific residential neighborhoods and dropped off physical catalogs in every mailbox. Residents could write down their orders and leave it back in the mailbox. Since the associate had no personal connection with these potential customers, this was not an effective strategy. This is why the change in Betterware’s sales model, implemented by Luis Campos, worked so well. As a result, a Betterware associate is usually a customer themselves first, then sells products to family, co-workers, and close friends. Given the strong family ties and loyalty among these groups, many people make a strong effort to order Betterware products through their friends or family members. 

Second, the original product catalog tailored more to the average British consumer rather than those in Mexico. To rectify this, Betterware focused its product portfolio on items that help organize, save space, or maintain a clean home because of the cultural importance of family and the home in Mexico and Latin America.

Thus, Betterware succeeded where its British parent failed, by capitalizing on Mexico’s family-oriented culture and creating a product line that focused on home organization and cleanliness.

**- Valuation -**

Betterware generated $350 million in revenue, $104 million in EBITDA, and $76.5 million in net income. The business also has 60% gross margins, 60% normalized returns on tangible capital, and net cash on the balance sheet. 2021 guidance points to $500 million in revenue, $148 million in EBITDA, and $112 million in net income.

At a $1.4 billion market cap, the stock trades at 12.5x 2021 earnings. This is an incredibly low valuation for a company that has grown at 40%+ annualized for the last 5 years and 135% in 2020. Furthermore, the management team, which has a reputation for being conservative, has guided to 45% revenue growth for 2021. This is likely extremely understated as the business exited 2020 growing at over 300% YoY, and 3rd party sources indicate that growth has remained elevated. The company also announced its annual dividend for 2021 of \~$67 million USD, which is roughly 66% of 2021 free cash flow, based on management’s guidance. With the business growing in excess of 40% a year, the dividend should keep growing annually. A 5% dividend yield is usually found in stable, mature, or distressed companies, not in asset-light platform businesses growing at high rates. Betterware also trades at 50% to 75%+ discounts to other Latin American platform and DTC businesses like MercadoLibre and Tupperware.

Additionally, Betterware has a strong runway to maintain its  growth. First, it only has 20% market share in Mexico and is expanding into surrounding Latin American countries including Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Second, Betterware only has about 20% wallet share at the moment. The company expects to grow this by introducing new products into the catalog to capture more of a typical family’s spending on home-related items.

Asset-light platform businesses with high growth tend to trade at large multiples and often for good reason. Betterware has all of these characteristics and profitability. It is also returning cash to shareholders via the annual dividend. If we assign even a 30x earnings multiple on Betterware’s 2021 earnings, it is over a $100 stock vs. $38 currently. Even ignoring the 135% revenue growth and even higher profitability growth in 2020, companies growing profitably at 45% a year tend to trade well above 50x earnings. At that price, BWMX is a $150 stock. To reiterate, all of these multiples are based on management’s forward guidance, which is extremely conservative.

We expect BWMX shares to increase from $45 to $100$120 in the next 6 to 18 months. If the market rewards BWMX in the same way it has other platform/marketplace companies, we can expect an upside target of over $200.

Q1 report was last night....blowout numbers again....stock has barely yawned.

**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights ($USD):**

* $144 million revenue (+205% YoY)
* $46 million EBITDA (+287% YoY)
* 31.8% EBITDA margin (vs. 25% Q1 2020)
* $32 million net income (+339% YoY - excluding currency hedging YoY, +578% growth)

**FY2021 Guidance (+10% from last update)**

* $552 million revenue (+60% YoY)
* $164 million EBITDA (+57% YoY)
* $124 million net income (+62% YoY)
* $106 million free cash flow (+77% YoY)
* $70 million USD dividend, remains same (3.9% yield)
* 14x P/E
* 10x EV/EBITDA

\- Guatemala expansion revenue up 382% YoY with 25% EBITDA

\- On track to expand into Peru and Colombia over next 2 years

Majority of 2021 CAPEX is related to the new headquarters/distribution center and other technology growth investments tied to that. Normalized free cash flow would be at least $10 million higher than shown here.

Here are some pics of the new facilities posted on the Twitter page of the governor of Jalisco (Mexican state where the new HQ/logistics operations are located):

Market and limit orders are obviously very easy to understand. I also understand stop limit orders for the most part...it's the stop loss orders that I'm having trouble grasping...

Isn't a stop loss order essentially the same as a limit order? If I set a stop loss order to sell for $10, then it will become a market order and sell for the next available price once it hits $10. If I set a limit order for $10 then it will only sell at $10. I understand that market orders can be slightly different than a limit order (price-wise depending on when the market order executes), but apart from that wouldn't the two basically be the same? 

Just looking for some clarification on non-market/limit orders. Thanks in advance!",

A stop loss is if drops too low then I want out whatever the market is trading at. A stop limit says it has to trade at certain price to sell and I won't settle for a lower price. For small trades it would likely be the same price. If the market makes a big move that may not happen.

Hi all,

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back.

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))

The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""

The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

Starting pay for hourly crew members will range from $11 to $18 an hour. There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.

Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he's seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.

As the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it's raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.

The company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.

The pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.

Chipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.

n99roc,,stocks,post,1620665193,"Vizio Holding Corp (NASDAQ: VZIO): for those who missed the $ROKU runVizio is the 2nd largest manufacturer of televisions in North America over the last 3 years and the largest for soundbars with $2 billion in annual revenue. The company had the unfortunate luck of going public at the end of March 2021 and faced a very tough tech IPO market to say the least. Nonetheless, Vizio’s reputation as a hardware company masks its small, but rapidly growing and extremely profitable advertising business that has grown at over 100% a year since it was established in 2018. Taking advantage of its large market share in TVs, the company is finally ramping up its ability to monetize the millions of daily users of its SmartCast operating system (found on every Vizio television). Essentially, Vizio is getting paid every time a user turns on the TV (and more) and is following a template already established by Roku. Vizio sold 17.1 million smart TVs between 2018 and 2020 and grew its active SmartCast accounts from 3.6 to 12.2 million accounts over that same time frame (a strong 70% conversion rate). 

To put the contrasting economics into perspective, in 2020, Vizio’s hardware business had 10% gross margins, contributed to 93% of total sales and 62% of total gross profit, and grew 7% YoY. Meanwhile, its SmartCast platform/advertising business had 76% gross margins (up from 60% in 2018), contributed to only 7% of total sales but 38% of total gross profit, and grew at 132% YoY. The growth in the high margin platform/ad business propelled total net income to expand more than 4x from $23 million in 2019 to $103 million in 2020 ($41 million of which was in Q4 2020 alone). Growth should remain strong for years to come, as the company has barely scratched the surface with monetizing its SmartCast platform.

At its current market cap of $4.6 billion (\~$25 a share), Vizio trades at 2x sales, 20x forward earnings, and has over $300 million in cash with no debt. As investor awareness improves regarding the high growth software platform, the stock's multiple should expand significantly and narrow the valuation gap with peers like Roku. Shares are easily worth 2x to 4x the current price. The company offers investors a compelling opportunity to gain exposure to the connected TV advertising market, which is projected to grow from $9 billion to $28 billion between 2020 and 2025. For a little preview of what VZIO could become (but on a smaller scale), take a look at a 5-year graph of ROKU ($18 → $300+).","['NDAQ', 'GPS']"

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
> The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&P technology sector.
*****
> The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
> The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
> “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
> Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
> The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
> Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
> The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
> Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
> “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
> # Tech battleground
> The S&P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
> In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
> Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
> The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
> Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
> “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
> “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
> Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
> “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
> Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
> “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
> Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

> # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

> After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

> As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

> While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

> While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

> In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETF's (ARKK) holdings, we created a custom portfolio that members can add here. Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKK's holdings as of 5/6/21.

> As always, investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities, and this chart analysis is in no way meant to be a buy or sell recommendation.

> # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

> As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

> Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

> To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

> # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

> Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

> Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

> “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

> Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

> # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

> One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

> With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

> Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

> “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&P 500 Index earnings growth.

> So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

> # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

> The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

I'm based in NZ and use Hatch Invest.

Right now I own a mish mash of stocks, ranging from Apple to Sony to Baba, to VACQ.

I'd like to set my portfolio on somewhat autopilot, with 10-20% for speculative plays (I want to keep my VACQ for eg). I'm bullish on certain plays, and I enjoy the personal picks aspect.

I'm only a few thousand into investing so far, and only put in a couple hundred a month, so now seems like the ideal time to rebalance before moving forward.

So I'm looking at one of the following options, and would love suggestions or reasoning on ratios and combinations:

Option 1:
40% VOO
20% VXF
20% VXUS
20% personal picks

Option 2:
60% VTI

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index   fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately  determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The more money that flows into index funds, however, [may worsen the results of index funds](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * This is a simplification as there are costs between the spreads, but you either pay management fees or the spread costs. You no longer have to have commissions on top.
* During times of volatility, companies that have poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)   even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
      * This may not be totally accurate as the manager may be doing some of this, but you don't have the choice of when he sells, only when you do.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due   to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the   index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that’s because it is.
      * Funds can attempt to counter this with some complex financial tools, but that doesn't mean they are successful.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market effectively. Tons of us seem to be able to buy at the peak no problem.
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies   with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a   sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies   missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech   seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this necessarily as a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite   compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being   found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the best companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well   diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the   S&P 500.

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This   seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I   ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.  Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less  than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will  likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical  issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were  also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they  could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750   stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks  were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the   industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4   years was compared to this index value with the following type of   breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For   example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was   10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,   they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The   relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there   was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth   only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be   decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This   left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the   company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently   in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them   being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?   Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude   them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These   26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and   September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these  stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total   purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The   chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested   dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

2020 LIST OF STOCKS:

* ABMD

* MNST
* MPWR
* MTCH
* OLED
* PAYC
* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For   those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date, including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850   tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.   The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More   metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were  then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to   determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to   median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of   the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3   stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over   the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each   stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I   also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the  metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this  ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a  score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9  categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a  company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could  do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t  match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or  the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the  analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I   applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at   the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock   that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a   high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,   I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their   financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off   their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly   leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that   Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns   Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great   synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of   this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,   such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil   and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated   \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a   separate model.

I then looked at   each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are   all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit   margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,   etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We   were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better   understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was   not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

# Notes

* I   partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021. Took a long time to write all of this up.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly   5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the   2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.
* It would  be great to be able to run some more thorough regression analysis, but since the math portion only narrows the playing field and a fair amount of the heavy lifting still occurs with individual analysis, this would be pretty much impossible. Creating a model based off past results may also provide a bias that I'm not sure I'd be immune to either.
* The math is used to find stocks worth reviewing, provide the visualizations to perform comparisons between stocks in the industry and across the full data set to assist with the human analysis.
* I've seen a fair number of posts along the lines of ""How do you find your stocks, how do I find stocks to research, etc."" Here are a list of \~100 stocks in a variety of industries you can review if interested. Some you've heard of, some you probably have not.
* The 2021 stock list makes up 28% of the S&P, with the 59 stocks that are in both lists, due to the market cap ranking.

\*I   am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to  ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results  and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t   understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and   henceforth. Past results are no guarantee of future returns.","['TYL', 'LKQ', 'ODFL', 'EXPD', 'IP', 'CHD', 'ETSY', 'FB', 'INTU', 'SPGI', 'VRTX', 'TDY', 'ANET', 'ADBE', 'MSFT', 'TER', 'TROW', 'ALGN', 'MPWR', 'IBM', 'CDNS', 'PAYC', 'INTC', 'KLAC', 'PHM', 'REGN', 'AMAT', 'FTNT', 'ACN', 'TSLA', 'DG', 'CPRT', 'ABMD', 'MKTX', 'ATVI', 'APH', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'GRMN', 'MNST', 'EW', 'LRCX', 'PAYX', 'ISRG']"

I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.

My main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I’ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don’t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:

- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN

EV=Market Cap + Debts - Cash

EV does not even consider the assets bought by the company. So I'm not understanding why it's more of an accurate value of a company. When it only includes Market Cap and debts - Cash.

Book Value= Total Assets - Liabilities

So why is book value not the full presentation of a company's value? When it already includes all the total assets and all the total liabilities. What variable is the book value missing compared to the EV? The money acquired (market cap) from the stocks, is it not in the balance sheet as well?

It’s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF’s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden. I own a couple shares and so does my spouse. 
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report. I am long a handful of shares here. 


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I’m good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car! (I own both tickers)

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you’re bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.(I own some shares and thinking of selling short term cash secured puts depending on the premium)

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. (Own a handful)

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.(have about a grand in here so one of my small mid positions)

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I’m sure you’ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that’s why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that’s some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn’t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery’s and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he’s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html (I am
Long Amazon)

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.( I am long)

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216. (I am long)

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you’re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don’t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.

n8i6vl,,stocks,post,1620579058,"BIGC earnings on May 11, could see a recovery from recent slideBIGC is an e-commerce company that competes with SHOP. The difference between BIGC and SHOP is that BIGC targets large companies and is more focused on customization of their shop front.

BIGC has recently been clobbered by the tech company bear market, seeing a price slide to ATL, well below its IPO opening price. The IPO was priced at $25, BIGC started trading at $80, and after some peaks to $120, its been on a slide consistently down where it has now settled at $48. So really, $25 --> $48 in the ultra-realitic case.

BIGC saw a small jump in its price after releasing its earnings on February 26, but returned back to its slide since then. https://investors.bigcommerce.com/node/7361/html#ITEM_8_FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS_SUPPLEMENTAR

In 2020, they saw 45% profit growth over 2019, which is a big jump from 2018-->2019.

At their current price point, they have a P/S of 21, which is on the low end for a tech e-comm company, especially since the comparisons to SHOP are direct. SHOP comparatively is at a PS of 40.

Now, here's the interesting risk/reward part. BIGC is trading at a level where a strong revenue beat, and projections of 50% revenue growth YoY could drive up the stock price with a 50% upside potential. Here's my logic:

Current P/S is 21 with a current revenue of $152M in 2020. Growth from 2019 to 2020 was 50%. So right now, it seems that revenue growth has not been factored into the price yet, and BIGC is in undervalued territory. If BIGC sees revenue in Q1 of $55M, that means they're on track to hit $220M for 2021, which is 50% revenue growth from 2020 to 2021. If that happens, BIGC now enters a trajectory to justify BOTH a higher multiplier (like SHOP) and a price increase based on the current multiplier.

BUT, here's the risk part. If BIGC misses revenue, and only gets revenue of $40M, I expect its stock to crash all the way to $25. BIGC is at ATL, and the only support below its current price is at $25 which was the IPO price. So the downside right now is 50% loss vs 50% gain. It almost feels like a blackjack hand.

Its also important to note that BIGC missed revenue in Q4 by 10%, coming in at $32M instead of $38M estimate. So maybe the dreams of a $55M quarter may be aspirational.",

  My stock is Kaleyra (KLR). Its an Italian company, a competitor of Twilio but in its infant stage. Its a very undervalued tech play as well: its valuation is only  $380 million, compared to Twilio's massive $52 billion. Why do I pick Kaleyra, instead of Twilio, or any other competitor? It operates as a bridge in the communication process of  App-Cloud-Message-Customer. A simple SMS from your bank app or Uber happens thanks to a company like Kaleyra.  Also provides communications involving chatbots, verification process, voice messages, Whatsapp messages, you name it.   Its a sector that keeps growing more and more and has significant barriers of entry. Here some points: 

\-It has a prices-to-sales ratio of 2, yes, only 2!. 

\-Kaleyra operates mainly in Europe, India, and its gaining ground in the US thanks to a very recent acquisition. It has a lot of know-how in the financial industry.

\-It is cash-flow positive. 

\-It has among its clients Twilio. Yeah, its main competitor has been its client. Plus other 3500 enterprise customers. 

\-It got its debut last year in Wall Street. With the acquisition of Mgage, its projected to double its revenue in a year or less. The stock price has suffered lately, no bad news whatsoever, just affected by the market in general and shorters: 15% of its stocks are shorted. 

\-Twilio is the absolute leader of this sector, with a better growth rate and better margins. However, a company like Kaleyra, with such a small valuation and great growth prospects, offers a potential multi-bagger possibility in a shorter time. Next earning report is next Monday.

n8ieiz,,stocks,post,1620579659,"How to value stocks as a non-professional?Hey, I have been investing in the stock market now for a couple of years. Started out as a very passive index ETF investor, but during the last year have transitioned my portfolio to be more stock heavy.  Due to this I have started to do my own research into individual companies. I find it somewhat easy with my value investing goals to identify good companies. The part I find extremely difficult (and I understand that I am not alone and that this is a multi-trillion dollar question) is to identify what is the ""fair"" value of a company?

I have tried to create my own DCF models and understand all the variables that go in to evaluating a company, but I have very quickly realized that I am way way out of my depth.

I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company.  Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

So my question is to the non-pro veterans of the stock market (or to anyone who has had success in getting a good value for their picks), how should an investor know when to buy when they think they have found a wonderful company?

English is not my first language so sorry for any spelling errors or otherwise weird sentences!",['MSFT']
n8ieiz,gxipexg,stocks,comment,1620582855,"everyone is different, i personally invest in things i know and things i believe in. i look at the legacy portion of there company and see how its still doing today, and the future outlook.. then, what are they doing right now to adapt to the future and create new revenue streams. and last but not least, look into who runs the company and how much you like or believe in them. Taking all that into consideration, looking at all the financials, decide if you think it is under valued and over valued, looking at trends, revenue, income, debt, assets, and the current pe and fe ratios.  


&#x200B;

The past year has taught me there is no one answer. You're asking a fundamental question about consumer psychology. Why is TSLA valued at 600x PE ratio while GM and F are at 10 and 11 respectively?

Fair value is very subjective and you'll find detractors and zealots on both sides of the argument.

I primarily look at projected future revenue and industry comparative P/S multipliers. This is myopic though as there are lots of other factors that matter including debt levels, P/B ratio, etc. I'm aware of this, but since I have a day job, I can't spend all my extra time doing complicated FA for every company I want to invest.

> I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company. Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

What you're talking about is not ""fair value"" but market sentiment. I think you'll never be able to reconcile the two. For every stock you buy thats further way from rational P/S, P/E, P/B and DCF levels, the higher risk you're taking that your investment will get blown out. But those companies are also the ones that return the highest returns if you got in early.

The short answer: You can't.

The most important answer: Invest in companies you're 100% committed and convicted. Only invest in companies that you'll defend to your dying breath. That people get annoyed when you bring them up because you talk about them so much. Anything else will create doubt and give you paper hands when the stock turns the other way.

Nothing in the stock market is guaranteed. The largest most stable companies may even shake out and collapse, so investing in ETFs is really the only winning strategy over a 20 year time horizon.","['TSLA', 'MSFT', 'GM']"

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

Uber in particular loses billions, with a B, and has no realistic path to profit. The only way taxi companies were able to survive was through government-backed monopolies. Now the market is hyper diluted, and we're supposed to believe they can be successful?

Doordash is in a similar boat. The little money they make comes through bullying and exploiting the restaurants they work with, to take some of the margins, and even that is no where near close to covering expenses.

n8i1z4,,stocks,post,1620578667,Help putting together a portfolio for maximum growthI’m new to investing and would like some guidance as to what to look for when choosing stocks that have maximum growth rates. I realize that higher risk is involved with  stocks going through high growth but I am willing to take my chances. What factors or stats do you look at when wanting to know how a stock is performing and how rapidly it’s growing?,
n8i1z4,gxijijj,stocks,comment,1620579958,"Just be aware that maximum growth also means maximum loss. If you're investing in a high growth company, you're betting heavily on future revenue and trying to pull forward the future value of a company to today.

I like to personally look at how fast revenue is growing QoQ and YoY. If revenue is growing at 50%+ YoY, companies can start seeing nose bleed valuations as investors will buy the stock today with the expectation that it will grow into its valuation in the future.

The other factor that matters a lot is P/S. When looking at revenue, if every stock was just mapped 1:1 to its current revenue, it would be an uninteresting game. P/S multiplier allow for different industries to have different mkt cap valuations despite pulling in the same revenue.


Overall, when you invest in growth companies, things can start getting out of your normal comfort zone as you'll have to justify why a company deserves to have traditional metrics that fall outside the mean.  For example: P/S multiples, willing to forgive debt ratio, focusing on subscribers/customers without focusing on profits, etc.

Also a huge factor is market sentiment. A company growing revenues 50% YoY in an uninteresting market may never see the stock price growth it deserves. Human psychology and the investing ""mob"" can move against you even if you picked a winner.


If you're looking for maximum growth, you need to first identify what markets will see the largest inflow of customers and revenue. Through 2020, the biggest growth industries were green energy, cloud stocks and EVs. All three had tailwinds of COVID WFH, huge revenue growth and speculation of political policies. But most of that hype has died down in the past 3 months.

Another high growth industry right now is genetics and bioengineering. Its a market in its infancy, and with that comes lots of risks of regulation, consumer acceptance and marketization. Investing in companies like EDIT, CRSP, ILMN, NVTA, etc could yield huge returns in the next 10 years if those things go in your favour.

In the next 12 months, the biggest growth may be in housing, construction and industrials. We're seeing price inflation in raw inputs and a rotation into manufacturing due to COVID reduction. Investing in more speculative businesses in this market (ie. 3D printing, commodities, etc) may yield good returns. Maybe look at the holdings in NAIL and identify which ones have the highest revenue growth potential.

Cybersecurity is also very hot right now. Investors may be willing to accept very high P/S multiples to buy cybersecurity firms because of the secular tailwinds with the transition of nation state proxy wars moving from the battlefield to cyberspace. Companies like FEYE, CRWD, ZS, NET, QLYS may work for your favour.",['ILMN']

n80bmo,,stocks,post,1620513573,"Alibaba: A Short Analysis**What does Alibaba do?**

First and foremost, they are an online commerce platform. They sell retail, they sell wholesale, they sell single items, they sell container loads of items. This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network, Cainiao Network, and an on-demand delivery and services platform, Ele.me. Then, they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment, gaming and other business units, but in this analysis I'll mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibaba's business strategy.

So, let's look at the online commerce. Is it doing well? Well? It's doing fantastic! The last year, it grew by 35% YoY! Over the last 5 years, online commerce sales increased by almost 500% from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020. To give you an idea, 1 US dollar was roughly 7.08 RMB then so Alibaba's online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly $61.5 Billion. Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing! In fact, this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is. Then, the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22% to 165 billion RMB or $23.4 billion. So, how are they doing THAT well? Simple! They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic, but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020. They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users. Essentially, they've got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINED!

So, Alibaba's online marketplaces include several websites, but not just any websites. In fact, the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN. THE. WORLD. Tmall and Taobao. Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place. The company presence is just mindboggling. And, to top it all off, the business model is much lighter than Amazon's, for example. Why? Well, Alibaba does not sell its own products, it doesn't have any inventory, doesn't have any warehouses, which results in less expenses and a higher net profit. How much higher? Well, Amazon's latest net profit margin is 5.53%. Alibaba's? 24.71%!

So, the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibaba's amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings. In fact, the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money, although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable, but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform. Now, the cloud computing is different. In the 4th quarter of 2020, it finally broke even! It is an important part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it. In 2020, cloud revenues grew by almost 62%! Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that way.

Overall, the company is growing fast, roughly 38% increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70% in the last year! We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well. How are its financials though? Well, it has a lot of cash, roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy. In fact, they've got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares. In the final quarter of 2020, they repurchased roughly $110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly, but they've approved a share repurchase plan of between $6 and $10 Billion. If we see them acting on that plan, investors could get very excited! So, the business is growing fast, the financials look solid, they're starting to return money to the shareholders. What about their price?

Well, the company is relatively cheap right now. Their PE ratio is 25.5 with a forward PE of 20.6. Historically, they have a PE average of 34.5 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now. Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so there's that. Compared to their direct Chinese competitors, Alibaba's PE isn't actually that low, but I'd say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Also, if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments, we can see that Amazon's PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 137.2, way higher than Alibaba! Amazon's PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibaba's! Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020.

But, they've also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them. Basically, we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal, at least in my opinion. It's no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY (Yahoo finance screenshot). Also, most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them. It's got better sales, better net profit margin, better brand presence, better long-term strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo, Vipshop, JD. Clearly, it's the better deal, at least in my opinion, but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well. Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20% of his Daily Journal portfolio.

Now, this stock just looks to good to be true, right? Sort of. Alibaba does have some issues, but they're of slightly different nature. The main risks involved with the company are more... political. First of all, you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military, that don't provide proper financial statements and reporting, that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government. Now, technically speaking, just because a company is delisted doesn't mean that you cannot trade it, but chances are that its stock price will be hurt... A LOT. You'd still be able to trade it over-the-counter, but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers won't support it. I know that my broker, eToro, does not. Still, you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibaba's stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The ticker is 9988, but it's essentially the same stock. Personally, I don't think that's going to happen, but don't take my word for it. Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delisting.

That isn't all though. Currently, there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies. Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma, its founder, made criticised the Chinese government's approach to financial regulations. As a result, the IPO for Ant Group, which is essentially Alibaba's spin-off that deals with consumer financing and lending, was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered. More recently, more regulations and restructuring was ordered. While this has affected Alibaba's business model to an extent, the regulations have also affected Alibaba's direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage. The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of $2.8 BILLION US dollars, the biggest one ever handed... so far. They also ordered the company to stop its anti-competitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms. So, are the regulators finished with Alibaba? Well, we can only speculate. The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses, which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies. They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies, but as I said this is not something that you can know for certain.

So, what's the verdict? Is Alibaba a good investment right now? Personally, I think so. It is undoubtedly risky, but the company offers such amazing prospects that it's just crazy to miss out on. I mean, if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price, wouldn't you? I'd recommend doing your own research into it, but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and that's why it is my second largest holding and almost 10% of my total portfolio. 

Finally, Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen. There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it, hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectory.

That's my analysis on Alibaba. There's a lot more to talk about, but I wanted to keep it on the short side. What do you think?

You have ordinary income of 39000 and long term capital gains of 180000.

Here is how that stack of income gets taxed in 2020 if you are single:

12400 ordinary at 0% = 0  
9875 ordinary at 10% = 988  
16725 ordinary at 12% = 2007  

13400 ltcg at 0% = 0  
166600 ltcg at 15% = 24990

Total income tax 2995, total cap gains tax 24990. Overall total tax 27985.

---

Notes

The 12400 is standard deduction not part of taxable income. 

Then 39000 – 12400 = 26600 of taxable income is chunked into the tax brackets, putting 9875 in 10% bracket (filling it) and putting 16725 in 12% bracket (only partially filled). 

The first 40000 of taxable income (above standard deduction) is occupied by 9875 + 16725 ordinary income + 13400 cap gains. It's just those 13400 cap gains that get the 0% cap gains tax rate.

The rest of the cap gains, 180000 – 13400 = 166600, get the 15% cap gains tax rate.",

n82716,,stocks,post,1620519632,"Buying overvalued stocks.Just want to get some experience and opinions here.  Obviously we should avoid overvalued stocks, because best case scenario there's not so much room to run, and worst case scenario they can actually plummet.  By overvalued I mean when the market value of the stock exceeds its intrinsic value, which can be calculated in different ways.  I find both [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) and [macroaxis.com](https://macroaxis.com) useful for a quick, automated reading.  I also understand that you can calculate it by hand, which I don't thanks to the wide variety of resources and analysts out there.

Anyway, I think most people would agree that the market is pretty high right now.  Are there deals to be had?  For sure!  And I think if you can find them, then that's obviously the best option.

But what do you guys think about buying a company that is slightly overvalued according to traditional metrics?  I'm not talking about Tesla here.  I'm talking about a blue-chip stock that may be trading 5-15% over what's considered fair.

Arguments against: it's a bad deal.

Arguments for: it may have more room to run, and time in the market beats timing the market.  If it's a good company you'll eventually recoup the initial investment and make gains even if it takes a bit longer.

Also keep in mind that I'm a small-time retail investor, as I'm sure many of us are.  Let's imagine I want to invest $1000 and I find a company with a fair value of $90, but it's trading at $100 currently.  I decide to go ahead and buy it, which would mean I'm paying a $100 premium for 10 shares of that company.

Is $100 really a big deal?  Again, as long as it's a good company with realistic prospects for growth, then sooner or later the stock's intrinsic value will surpass the market value.  You're out $100 that you could have invested in better value, but at the same time you've locked yourself in to a good company with good long-term growth prospects.

If it were a $100,000 investment, of course, you have a bigger issue.  Percentage wise it's the same, but I think you could argue that an extra $100 isn't really worth splitting hairs about.  $10,000 might be.

I also considered that you could balance out overvalued companies with undervalued ones.  Instead of buying 10 overvalued companies, which start to add up, you could lock yourself into 5 high-conviction overvalued companies, and balance them out with 5 undervalued plays to net a fair purchase value.

I hold positions in the aforementioned companies and long for them**. **I removed some part of the post as it violates** r/stocks **rules.**

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM).

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021.

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+.

I believe we’re probably 4th or 5th inning here. For my disclosure, I’m \*still\* very long nearly all the key names in the space- $ATCO $CPLP $DAC $MPCC (Oslo) $NMM and $ZIM.

n7mz6p,,stocks,post,1620472158,"LMND - an over valued insurance stock pretending to be a tech stock?I got caught up in LMND during the January hype and I now I'm a bag holder. It's made me look at LMND in more detail and really dissect their financials. Below is a short DD on LMND looking at their 10K annual report in preparation for their Q1 report coming out on Monday.

https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001691421/7d400e55-689a-4fc1-9a55-28ce9601dc6e.pdf

To begin, LMND is an insurance provider that is looking to disrupt the insurance marketplace using AI to handle claims and drive high customer support.

LMND is currently trading at MktCap of 5B with a P/S multiple of 52. Compared to other incumbents in the pure insurance industry:

ALL: P/S - 0.89, MC - 40B

PGR: P/S - 1.39, MC - 62B

TRV: P/S - 1.26, MC - 40B

So obviously LMND is trading at a multiple that treats it more like a tech company than an insurance company. But lots of companies want to be valued at a multiple of a tech company vs insurance company, so lets dig deeper.

LMND made 94BM in revenue in 2020 with a YoY growth of 40%. In their earnings call in March, they stated that they expect greater growth slowdown in 2021...so there's definitely reason to be cautious here given that their mkt cap multiplier is totally based on growth projections.

Here's the troubling part of LMND. Even though their revenue is growing aggressively, their net losses are stacking up too. In 2019 they had net loss of 108M on 67M of revenue, and in 2020 they had net loss of 120M in 94M of revenue. So though their net losses aren't growing at the same rate as their revenue, they're definitely not closing the gap at a great rate. The biggest contribution to their net losses is G&A and technology development. G&A can't be helped as I assume they went on a hiring blitz in 2020. But their investment in ""technology development"" increased 98% from 9.8B to 19.4B. 

While G&A is straight forward as employee compensation, Technology Development is listed as follows:

Technology development - Technology development consists of employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and benefits, and expenses related to vendors engaged in product management, design, development and testing of the Company's websites and products. Technology development also includes allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount.

Pretty abstract stuff...

Okay, so lets make some projections. The simplest projections is that we're seeing a big shift in the tech market place as a bear market has taken hold the past 3 months. May doesn't look any better, but many of these high flying ""tech stocks"" are now seeing a reduction in multiple. Even if LMND could grow their revenue by 200% this year, if the market starts valuing them like an insurance company and not a tech company (a la RKT), we'll see LMND's price tank into the mid 20's and maybe even lower.

The second projection is if we look at growth of revenue. In their Q4, Lemonade said they are seeing slowdown in a key growth metric:

https://news.futunn.com/en/post/8971338?level=1&data_ticket=1620471675650956

The stock tanked to $113 from $132, and has been on a slide since then, influenced by general tech stock malaise. Even at its current price of $79 it seems over valued in some regards.

Here are the key metrics to look for. LMND is projecting revenue in Q1 to be 22M. That would set it on base to make about $100M in CY2021. Which isn't spectacular growth to justify its valuation, as it slows the growth rate down to 10% YoY.

Overall, LMND stock looks really dicey at the moment. Given this information, I'm probably going to unload half my bags before earnings and see what the news is. If the news is good, then I'll hold the other half and hope to reduce my losses. Otherwise, I plan to immediately unload the remaining half if the growth numbers look bad since this will ensure another 3 month slide in price. If growth numbers are bad, expect LMND to fall below their IPO price.

LMND did an offering at $165/share in January. I feel real bad for anyone who has their cost average that high, because looking at their financial statements and projections, LMND doesn't look like they'll get back up there in 2021.



Last note, I think LMND is aiming for an AI holy grail to do their real disruption. They're hoping that if they can handle all claims using AI (of which, currently AI Jim, their claims AI, handles 95% of all claims), they may be able to drive down their costs of doing business so aggressively that their margins become industry leading. Company's like ALL, TRV and PGR have demonstrated that they are too large and bureaucratic to offer solutions like this. So right now, this is the only saving grace of LMND imho.

IBM (IBM) on Thursday debuted the world’s first 2-nanometer chip making technology, which could enable massive performance gains in terms of both power and battery life over the current industry-leading processors found in everything from smartphones and tablets to the massive computer servers that power the cloud.

“Right now, in the most advanced production in the world is about the 7-nm node, you know on the verge of getting to 5-nm node,” Darío Gil, SVP and director of IBM Research, told Yahoo Finance.

“What we're talking about here is the first time in the world that anybody has shown, externally, that there's a viable technology to enable the 2-nm node.”

if you buy a stock at 10$, sell it at 13$. that’s 13-10=3, and then 3/10 x 100 = 30%",

In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.

Drugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.

“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space.

n974pi,,investing,post,1620659349,"[Motley Fool] Current model for Uber, Lyft just doesn't work. Expenses have scaled up in near-perfect step with revenue, as have net losses. As it stands now, both EBITDA improvement outlooks are tough to believe.https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/10/quarterly-losses-uber-lyft-confirm-ride-hailing/

The business premise seems sound enough, at least on the surface. The problem: Owning a vehicle is more trouble than it's worth, but taxi cabs are costly and so yesterday. The solution: Just use a mobile app to summon a contracted driver who will ferry you from one place to another at a more efficient (i.e. cheaper) price. Everyone wins.

Except not everyone is winning with this modern-day business model. Shareholders of ride-hailing powerhouses Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) just saw another quarter of steep losses.

Both companies fared better than expected, mind you, at least on the earnings front. But both companies' losses continue to scale up in step with revenue growth rather than decline, as their two biggest expenses are directly tethered to sales. Those expenses are the cost of revenue -- what Uber and Lyft are paying their drivers -- and marketing expenses.

It's past time for investors to ask what the plausible path to profitability looks like for these companies.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

What's changing?
For the record, the analyst community isn't fazed by the losses so far, apparently convinced that both ride-hailing brands are on the cusp of fiscal breakthroughs. Current estimates imply Uber will cut its operating losses by more than half this year, and do the same again in 2022. Those same analysts are predicting Lyft will swing to operating profitability next year. Investors are (for the most part) buying into this bullishness.

The graphics below put things in perspective, starting with Uber Technologies. Notice how, thus far, the company's cost of revenue has consumed 45% to 50% of revenue. Analysts believe these costs will fall toward 40% of sales in the foreseeable future, when marketing spending is expected to slide well below 30% of revenue.

Uber's profitability is projected to widen soon, but the company's not explained how its driver costs are going to be curbed.
DATA SOURCE: THOMSON REUTERS. CHART BY AUTHOR. DOLLAR FIGURES ARE IN MILLIONS.

The same basic concern applies to Lyft, though at different proportions. Lyft's cost of sales -- or its direct cost of delivering services -- lingered in excess of 50% of sales before COVID-19 took hold. Now expectations are that those costs can be whittled down to under 40% of revenue. Marketing expenses are projected to fall to single-digit percentages, while administrative expenses are expected to fall despite expansion into new ventures like bikes, scooters, car rentals, and mass transit (public busing) partnerships.

Lyft's driver costs are supposed to inch lower, improving profits. The ride-hailing outfit has yet to explain how this biggest cost is feasibly going to fall though.
DATA SOURCE: THOMSON REUTERS. CHART BY AUTHOR. ALL DOLLAR FIGURES ARE IN MILLIONS.

What's missing from both of these progressive forecasts, however, is a clear explanation of how the ride-hailing business model is going to cost less on a per-mile or per-ride basis in the future than it has in the past. More scale doesn't inherently translate into profitability if most of your expenses are variable costs rather than fixed costs. 

Unanswered questions and overlooked threats
Being pessimistic about either company's future is tough these days, of course. Both stocks are rated as buys, and each is currently trading below analysts' consensus price targets.

Then there's the encouraging commentary of each outfit's top executives. Lyft CEO Logan Green explained during the company's first-quarter conference call that ""as the recovery continues, we're confident we'll be able to deliver strong organic growth and adjusted EBITDA improvements."" That swing to positive EBITDA should take shape during Q3 of this year, according to the company. Uber's chief Dara Khosrowshahi is just as bullish, commenting during his company's first-quarter call that ""Even as we invested for growth, the benefits of scale and rigorous cost management drove an adjusted EBITDA improvement of $253 million year on year and $95 million quarter on quarter."" Khosrowshahi also broadly suggested positive EBITDA figures were in sight. Package and food deliveries will help on that front.

Neither chief, however, explained exactly how or why it's going to cost less to drive a passenger from point A to point B in 2021 than it did in 2019 -- before the pandemic shook things up, and when gasoline was still dirt-cheap.

It's also naive to ignore how efforts to protect so-called ""gig"" workers aren't already threatening both companies' business models, which lean heavily on the relatively lower costs of contracted drivers (as opposed to conventional employees). The threat of that additional expense will only grow as time marches on, and even without the regulatory movement we've already seen, would-be drivers aren't being lured back en masse despite big sign-up bonuses and incentives put in place last month. Uber's management clearly conceded this headwind during last week's call, although it downplayed the actual scope of the risk.

To its credit, Lyft cut its marketing spending dramatically last quarter. Uber's Khosrowshah believes his company will need less advertising in the future as well. 

That too may mostly be wishful thinking, though, given the competition coming to the market. Alphabet's driverless ride-hailing service Waymo is up and running in Phoenix, and the company's ultimate aim is to expand the service. In the meantime, smaller start-ups like Blacklane, Myle, and Nomad are just some of the names standing ready to swipe share from a market Uber and Lyft largely developed.

The point is that marketing isn't something that's easy to simply stop doing, or even curtail. It's conceivable both of these companies will need to expand rather than reduce their marketing outlays in the future.

Bottom line
Both Uber and Lyft can continue to scale up, but to what end? Both have already been scaling up for some time. Expenses have merely scaled up in near-perfect step with revenue, as have net losses. Investors may want to start asking for specifics about each company's cost-reduction plans, and then decide whether or not they're plausible. As it stands now, both EBITDA improvement outlooks are tough to believe.","['UPS', 'GOOGL', 'PGR', 'NDAQ']"

n8nkcd,,investing,post,1620594296,"Why would someone invest in real estate today when stocks seem much accessible and better?Traditionally, real estate was always seen as one of the best kinds of investment, but imo that's largely because knowledge on stocks was much more rare, and it wasn't as easy back then, since there weren't many investing apps, higher fees, and it wasn't as easy to do. 

While there are of course still challenges and risks, there seems to be countless reasons today why stocks are now much easier and better, and barely any reasons to invest in real estate, given how expensive real estate has become right now, and this is coming from someone who's followed investing for several years now, seen multiple crashes, as well as bull markets as well.  

With stocks 

1. The barrier to entry is much less, you just need an app or computer and can do it on your spare time. 
2. It's cheaper, you can start with as little as $100 to an infinite amount. Where I'm from, studio apartments go in the mid 6-figures, and even in lower costs of living area, you still need several $1000s for a down payment, on top of multiple other costs, and a stable salary to continuously pay your mortgage. 
3. It's more liquid, you can sell at anytime you need, of course probably don't want to during a down market, but at least it's an option. With real estate, you could be stuck holding onto property indefinitely, and the amount of work to sell or rent out is significantly greater. 
4. There is more potential and money to be made, even if playing the lower risk game, and choosing common sense FANMG stocks, many of these stocks have gone up 2-5 folds over the last several years, meanwhile you'd be hard press to ever find real estate that can go up even 2x within 5 years, if even in 10 years. 
5. Much less work, at least compared to real estate, where you have to physically manage, deal with tenants, work on the legal side, and all the other hassles that can happen running a property. 

I could see it being different before this era, when it was much cheaper, but it seems like today, stocks are significantly more accessible, liquid, much less work, and have a higher potential to make even more money from too, so is there really any point investing in real estate today, aside from the actual property you have to live in?",

i dont think getting lucky picking tech is the same as low risk. if your comparison relies on hindsight analysis its probably pretty ineffective

real estate allows for pretty significant growth. keep in mind that you use a significant amount of leverage when buying real estate, if you put down 20% on a 1m property and it grows 10% in a year youve gained a lot more than 10% relative to your actual investment",

n90hkk,,investing,post,1620639488,"Market valuations and investing allocations - indexes vs stock pickingHi.

I want some input here, cause I simply can't make my mind up.

I'm currently holding my PF, while adding a small amount of money in 5 different index funds monthly.

In terms of money I'm saving about $ 700 in an world index fund every month as locked in pension savings, and another $ 700 in 5 different index funds for personal savings (E.M., Scandinavia, Europe, World and small cap - I'm considering wiping the Europe fund here, but I digress). So that's $ 1400 montly in indexes.

I'm also stacking about $ 2000 in cash every month. This goes hopefully into the market in the future or as downpayment on my mortgage (depending on inflation and change in interest).

Other than that I have a stock picking PF with a handful of companies. 

Now here's the kicker. I'm aware I can't time the market. I don't believe I can, but the question is whether I see a big upside in indexes from here on. And I'm not sure I do. The markets might keep growing a bit more, but I feel the risk reward is unfavourable atm, and I wonder if indexes isn't the right thing now. I honestly feel far more comfortable with doing value buys, and there's less risk of buying dividend blue chips who aren't in favour.

A few months ago my last big buy happened and that was Bayer AG. After that I've kind of been on the sidelines as I haven't seen anything interesting.

What's your opinion on investing right now? Would you stick to investing heavily in indexes or rotate into stock picking?  If so, would you sell off index funds? Or ride it out?",

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

Industrials (XLI) tend to be good at the start of reflation, but as inflation starts to bite into the economy, a lot of the industrials end up getting hit hard from high producer price inputs.

But this is basically just a transfer of wealth to smaller companies startups, and venture capital.  At some level of size D&I doesn’t do anything.  And there is a new wave of startups that are becoming apolitical like Coinbase which may also counterbalance this over time.  Trends in corporate governance come and go and rarely drive business cycles.

In times of inflation the best places to put your money are in certain “hot” commodities and emerging markets.  But personally I am not buying the inflation hype over the long term.  The western world is too old and technologically advanced to stoke major bouts of inflation barring some black swan events.",

n98sow,,investing,post,1620662804,"Investing during a potential bubbleI’ve posted this question in the advice thread but I haven’t read anything that has satisfied my curiosity, so I would love to hear from the greater r/investing community if possible. 

There’s been no shortage of posts regarding high valuations / the potential bubble / the supposedly inevitable correction/crash/bear market. Whenever there is a post asking how to best prepare/protect against this potential correction, the general response is “lump sum always beats DCA / don’t try to time the market.”

If I first began investing in a basic s&p 500 index just before the dot com bubble crashed, and lump summed all of my cash, it would have taken me nearly two decades to get out of the red, that is, if I was able to hold all that time without selling at a loss. As a new investor, I’m afraid of this happening again. I’m debating whether or not it’s even worth investing right now, but the general sentiment seems to be to never hold cash trying to time the market.

I’m not investing for retirement, as I have a pretty good pension plan and I’m still relatively young (25). For someone with no money currently in the market who is looking to invest  with more short term goals (say 5-10 years), what is the best option given current valuations? With the knowledge you have now after years of investing, what would your strategy be?",['SPGI']

n94bfc,,investing,post,1620652939,"Some long-term strategies worth remembering in today's speculative and volatile marketsBefore we get into the juicy details, think for yourself: What are you shooting for? What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back. 

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))  


The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""  


The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

**Thinking About Thinking**

**Max Raskin:** Let me ask you about your day. Do you have to-do lists?

**David Rubenstein:** Over the course of my life, I have tried those. And over the course of my life, it lasts about three or four days, and then I don't have them.

I try to train my brain to have them. I think I'd probably be better organized if I had to-do lists, but I don't usually do it. Some people I know are obsessive about it. Jamie Dimon is really good about that. He always seems to have these lists he’s pulling out.

**MR:** How do you stay organized in your head?

**DR:** I look at what I'm supposed to be doing in that week, and I prepare for it. If I'm interviewing somebody, I'll make sure I read the materials, prepare the questions – if I'm being interviewed, I try to prepare for that . . . though you wouldn't know from this interview that I tried to prepare for this interview.

**MR:** It sounds like it’s based around the calendar. How scheduled is your week?

**DR:** It's highly scheduled, because reason one, I don't like to waste time. I'm always trying to make sure I'm not just sitting around lounging and doing nothing. Secondly, I have two people that work full time putting the schedule together. I'm on 30-some nonprofit boards, I'm involved in a lot of financial organizations, I make a lot of speeches, and I do interviews. It’d be rare that I have a day where there's nothing scheduled – including the weekends. 

**MR:** Do you chunk out time to do nothing?

**DR:** No, I'm not really good at that. And that's a failing. We all have our personal weaknesses, and I'm not good at doing nothing. I always will feel guilty – maybe it's Jewish guilt, that if I'm doing nothing, I'm wasting my time.

**America Runs on Dunkin’**

**MR:** What do you drink during the day?

**DR:** Well, that's a challenge, because I try not to drink sugary drinks – so I drink water and tea. And when I’m being sinful, I have iced tea from Snapple. It’s diet, but it’s still sweetened.

I don’t drink alcohol and I don’t drink coffee. I’ve never tasted coffee and I’ve never tasted alcohol. I just avoid those.

**MR:** I don’t drink coffee either. We invest in coffee companies, but I never drink coffee.

**DR:** We owned Dunkin’ Donuts for a while, but I never was interested in drinking coffee. About 20 years ago, I used to drink a lot of Diet Cokes and I read how unhealthy it was. I stopped cold turkey and I haven’t had a Coke in 20 years.

**MR:** Do you carry around a water bottle?

**DR:** No, I’m not that obsessive compulsive about it. But there are people that do that – it’s maybe a show of something or other when you do that.

**MR:** Do you snack during the day?

**DR:** I do, from time to time, snack. Again, I wish I didn't, but I'm trying to reduce my snacks, so I have eliminated most snacks now.

**MR:** If health wasn’t a thing, what would you eat?

**DR:** If I didn't have to worry about calories, I guess cheese crackers, potato chips, pretzels, Fritos – all the other things that I used to think were great when I was a little boy. Now I realize they're putting me in the grave sooner than I otherwise would want – at least some people might say that. I’m sure the producers of those products wouldn’t say that.

I would tell you that one of my daughters has had some health issues over the years – she’s concluded that some of her health issues deal with the fact that she doesn’t eat healthy enough foods. So she now has her own private equity fund that invests in healthy foods. She’s obsessed about it. [Manna Tree](https://www.mannatreepartners.com/). She always has the latest healthy thing that you can eat.

**MR:** Did you ever smoke?

**DR:** No, I never did. I always thought that there was no benefit to smoking. My parents smoked when I was little. When I was a child, I had asthma, and probably it was caused in part by my parents’ smoking – at least that's my 20-20 hindsight.

**MR:** Did you ever try a cigarette at a party?

**DR:** No, I would never do that. ",

n8udjg,,investing,post,1620615985,"Seeking Long Horizon Investment AdviceI'm contemplating making some investment changes, but am concerned about a possible double dip correction in the near/semi-near future. I realize that this thinking flies in the face of the ""time in the market, as opposed to timing the market"" strategy. 

So, the bulk of my retirement is in a Vanguard Target Date Fund, which I contribute to monthly. I also have a legacy retirement account from a former employer, which earns 4 percent annually. I am considering rolling over those funds to my Target Date IRA though. Thoughts?

I also have 6 figures sitting in a cash reserve account earning a paltry 45 basis points; wish I had been more aggressive in March 2020. Anyhow, my thinking is to invest a portion of those funds in the vehicles below now - taxable account - and leave some dry powder for potential corrections:

- Emerging Markets (FEMKX): I have roughly 5% exposure in my Target Date Fund, but am looking to possibly increase based on future market forecasts. Thoughts?

- REIT's (VGSLX/VNQ): I don't have any exposure here and like the potential, as well as the dividend yield. Thoughts? 

- Disruptor Fund (FGDFX): A Fidelity alternative to Cathie Wood's disruptive funds. 

- Other: Alternative / Renewable Energy, Cannabis, and Biotech Funds/ETF's: Thoughts?

Finally, any suggestions on lump sum investments in the above (others) now or dollar cost averaging over time?

n8hkut,,investing,post,1620577266,"Investing Styles Part 2: Ray Dalio and Risk-Parity Investing Ray Dalio, the master of the LinkedIn essay and co-CIO of a minor hedge fund, is the subject of the next installment of investing styles. Ray’s All-Weather Fund is a risk-parity approach to investing, an approach that aims to diversify equal risk amongst a set of assets that have minimal or negative correlation in the event of rising or falling growth and inflation across the world economy.

The set of assets in Ray’s approach is wider than most individual investors consider: Emerging Market Credit, Corporate Credit, and Commodities, in addition to equities and bonds. Ray’s selection of assets in his risk-parity fund was driven by his belief that there are 2 core environmental drivers of markets - growth and inflation. Different assets in the portfolio perform under the 4 possible combinations of rising or falling growth and rising or falling inflation. Rather than allocating solely to assets that perform well over a falling inflation/falling growth regime, he spread the allocation over assets that perform under each of the four possible regimes. Helpful grid of the assets that perform in each regime here: [https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0](https://imgur.com/HnQ3Qp0). Since the market is forward-looking, what matters for classifying the regime is not just the direction of growth and inflation, but whether or not the direction is already expected, and thus priced into the market. You want to have assets that are durable when inflation or growth surprises to the upside/downside. 

Now for the controversial element of risk-parity: leverage. Rather than allocating an equal dollar amount to each of the assets outlined above, the allocation strategy is to employ leverage on lower volatility assets to achieve higher mean return at the cost of higher volatility and of the interest rate of the borrowed dollars used to lever. For example, if you have an asset with a 2% historical mean return and 5% historical volatility then you could achieve a higher expected mean return by leveraging the asset 2x to increase the expected mean return to 4% while expected volatility is now 10%. Additionally, you should expect to pay some interest rate on the margin used to implement the leverage.

The decision of how much to lever is usually set by targeting a total portfolio volatility and then giving each asset in the portfolio an equal volatility budget. If it’s a lower volatility asset, for example TIPS or investment grade corporate bonds, then the leverage ratio is higher. But for a volatile asset like equities there may be no leverage at all since the existing asset volatility already meets the volatility budget.

It isn’t intuitive how in theory applying leverage in this way can actually decrease portfolio volatility over time so it’s helpful to compare a 60/40 equities bond portfolio against the risk-parity allocation to equities and bonds. In the 60/40 portfolio the total portfolio volatility is dominated by the equity component. In the risk-parity portfolio the same mean-return as the 60/40 portfolio could be achieved with lower volatility by allocating less to equities and more to bonds and applying leverage. If you are a nerd and interested in more theory about portfolio allocation strategies under risk parity I recommend this AQR overview: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/White-Papers/Understanding-Risk-Parity) 

So how does Ray think the average Joe should invest using this risk-parity theory jumbo? Well, he did an interview with Tony Robbins in 2015 suggesting a 55% allocation to US bonds but every recent interview is about cash being trash, US bonds being dumb and investing in Asia. If you happened to have a couple billion dollars you could directly invest in his hedge fund but for us poors we’re stuck with mutual funds and ETFs. The central idea of risk-parity can be applied in your own portfolio by diversifying among assets that will perform well in different regimes. If your portfolio doesn’t have any assets that perform well under a rising inflation/rising growth regime then consider looking into commodity ETFs and inflation-linked bonds.  


The choice to use leverage as a retail investor is harder to recommend than the ideas around diversification. The theory of leveraging lower volatility assets in order to achieve higher return makes sense but there are downsides. One is that retail investors will pay higher costs to use leverage, either in high-fees for leveraged ETFs or in higher margin fees than institutions. The other, perhaps more relevant, risk for retail is failure to manage the risk of leveraged assets well. There must be rebalancing between assets to maintain the risk budgets of each asset and if the correlations of assets within the portfolio change then the fundamental assumption of assets performing under different regimes can be violated and leverage ratios should be managed accordingly. Another option is to trust a mutual fund or robo-advisor to manage this risk-parity approach for you, but as noted above the implementation matters and the fee drag of expensive risk-parity products should be considered.  


Hopefully you can take some ideas about allocating risk across your portfolio, considering other asset classes, and the performance of your portfolio under different market regimes into your own investing style. Next time, I will cover Christopher Cole’s long term investing style which aims to protect against the tail events that even risk-parity funds do not handle well.

For particulars you need to the read the prospectus of the Index. The prospectus will explain things like how closely they will mirror what they are indexing. There is usually an allowance for minor mis-weighting of stocks. There is also an allowance for how much time they have to make changes.

SPY is suppose to make changes, as needed, at least once a month and they allow the fund to make changes more often during periods of significant change.

But this can get complicated quickly too....ETFs are designed to be sold and traded between investors, but new shares  of the ETF can also be created or redeemed each business day... The holder often will redeem shares if the holdings in the ETF are undervalued by the ETF price. This is the mechanism that keeps the ETF consistently values with what is in the fund.  This means the index has to buy or remove stocks for the fund on a daily basis in very small amounts. (redeeming typically only happens on a large institutional level)

Typically this buying, in particular, starts adjusting to the new weighting of the S&P 500 index, so companies that were removed or lost value are more likely to be sold and companies that gained value or were added are more likely to be bought.

This means each day the fund starts changing towards the more updated index they are trying to mirror through the natural change.

&#x200B;

Lastly, it is important to remember if an ETF index fund is weighted by market capitalization, the companies that enter of leave the index are usually a tiny fraction of the index's total capitalization.

Just as some examples, #450 is only 0.032% of the index, #500 is only 0.016% of the index, #400 is 0.043% of the index.

The top of the index #1 is 5.76%, #50 is 0.43%, #100 0.23%... and so on.

The reason I mention this part is most companies being removed from the index usually fall in market capitalization over a period of time before they are dropped from the index. They become a smaller portion of the index as it drops in market capitalization, so the index has likely been slowly selling off the asset over time.

By the time it becomes #480 before not being in the index at all, it is very small. There isn't that much to sell, so there is somewhat of a gradual change built in to the fund in most cases... Of course, any large abrupt changes in the market, means larger changes are needed at one time in the index portfolio.",['SPGI']

n8fpef,,investing,post,1620571698,"Understanding the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)So I was reading up about how the Fed can attempt to influence credit availability and long term interest rates by controlling what is used to calculate the SLR (as they did last year 1st April).

My understanding that the SLR requirements are put in place to ensure banks have enough capital with respect to their risky assets such that if they lose the assets (eg people defaulting on loans and mortgages as they did in 2007/8), they have sufficient capital to cover those potential losses such that they will not go under.

However, I have trouble understanding **why** certain things are included in the calculation, and some not. My google search has mostly been futile as the same findings are repeated about what is the SLR, what goes into its calculations. I want to understand **why** it is the case.

So to start off, the definition of the SLR =  Tier 1 Capital / Total Leverage Exposure .

1. Tier 1 Capital includes ""Common Equity Tier 1"" and ""Additional Tier 1 Capital"".
2. Total Leverage Exposure refers to ""Both on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet assets exposures"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think of it as assets that have a **risk of declining in value** (eg derivatives, loans, etc).

For 1, my main trouble is understanding ""Common Equity Tier 1"", which investopedia says it ""comprises a bank’s **core capital** and includes **common shares**, stock surpluses resulting from the issue of common shares, retained earnings, common shares issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties, and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).""

* To me, when I think of a bank's core capital, the first thing that pops into my mind would be the actual amount of cash they have (minus deposits since deposits are not factored in to the SLR anyways). But clearly I'm missing something here because cash is nowhere to be seen. I was thinking that that it is better expressed in the form of retained earnings, because that would have accounted for any expenses and liabilities.
* Another thing is the bank's own common shares being considered core capital. While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can **banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss**? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

Now, for 2, the Fed introduced a temporary change on 1st April 2020 (and which has since expired) where ""the change would exclude **U.S. Treasury securities** and **deposits at Federal Reserve Banks** from the calculation of the rule "". This effectively lowers the denominator for the banks, increasing their SLR and giving them more leeway to **lend out their capital (cash), providing credit for the economy**, and also allows them to **park more of their (non-productive) cash into US treasury bonds (which give interest), thus lowering bond yields**, helping the Fed control long term interest rates. These two outcomes, as per my understanding, was why the Fed allowed this change in light of the Covid shock to markets and the economy.

* I can understand and accept that US treasury securities, although almost considered to be risk-free, are still debt assets (which are inherently risky), and hence included into the equation in which banks have to hold a certain amount of capital against. What I don't understand is why deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks are included. My understanding is that banks, instead of keeping excess reserves/deposits with themselves, they can deposit them with the Fed and get a small interest on it (better than nothing). But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) **have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them**?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?
* When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. **Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?**
* After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

As one can see from my myriad of questions, I'm definitely no banker or accountant or whatever, in fact just a barely 20 y/o kid trying to learn more about the financial world. My understanding towards the SLR is probably ridden with misunderstanding and would really appreciate if people, or actual bankers over here, can help me clear it up.",['GOOGL']

In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.",['CB']

n8pzgh,,investing,post,1620601476,"The Small Arms Industry is Set to Grow RapidlyI may do a much longer and well-sourced post on this when I have more time, but here's a rundown of why the small arms industry, in my opinion, is an excellent long term investment, not even looking at how the Biden administration will play into the cyclical nature of gun stocks.



**The Youth in Existing Gun Markets Support Liberalization**
Something like 60% of youth support gun rights; this is a big indicator that government policy will not do anything to harm the industry to a large extent.



**Firearm Popularity is Rising Worldwide**
Markets like Brazil under Bolsonaro or the Phillipines under Duterte have increased firearm purchased through liberalization or idolization, providing a future for gunmakers outside of the US and Russia. I also see Africa and the rest of SE Asia liberalizing gun laws in the next few decades.



**The rise of hyperpolarization and populism**
Uncertain or polarized political circumstances means more people hostile toward one another. This was at the fore during riots last year and the Capitol Insurrection. Partially as a result, gun sales were at record highs last year. I see this polarization, due to the spread of social media, rising across the globe and thus, long term gun sales.



**Long Term Industry Consolidation is Likely**
As with many other industries, consolidation is very likely in the firearms industry as they inevitably face scaling and uncertain political climates. Investors will benefit most from this consolidation provided you choose a company not going bankrupt.



**There's just a lot of room to grow**
Gunmaker's supply chain is ridiculously overcomplex with lots of simplification that could happen (Glock rates higher in this but they're private :( ). The merchandising chain also leaves lots of profit on the table (suppliers, coordinators, retailers, etc.). Models could also be optimized, tech better integrated, etc. There's just a lot of cash to grow into.





All in all, the gun industry presents an interesting opportunity for growth, beyond their current trading dynamic, something I will be tracking in earnest. Just wish Sig and Glock were public lol.



My Picks:

- Smith & Wesson: Will benefit most off of sales in the US, has enough cash on hand for consolidation opportunities, has ability to streamline, cult base, etc.


- Taurus: If Glock or S&W are the Apple of firearms, Taurus is the Samsung, the mass market firearm corporation that I believe will be immensely popular in developing countries, considering its success in Brazil and Colombia",['AAPL']

For those Tesla investors who don't subscribe to Barrons, they ran a story today:

>*Tesla Stock Is Dead Money—for Now. Sell in May and go away usually refers to the entire stock market. Right now it also applies to Tesla’s stock.*[https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-needs-a-catalyst-here-are-some-contenders-51620434748?mod=hp\_DAY\_2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-needs-a-catalyst-here-are-some-contenders-51620434748?mod=hp_DAY_2)

The author's argument is that Tesla lacks a big catalyst to drive shares higher. He doesn't mention new factories under construction, or the push into cryptocurrencies, or changing opinions toward electric vehicles. The bottom line, he argues, is that TSLA isn't going straight up.

>*After an epic rise, the stock has stalled. That is just what Tesla stock tends to do—rocket higher after major milestones, then do nothing for a while.*

The author's point is valid, but also irrelevant. Unless your investment horizon is right now, this isn't a problem.

The same point could have been made about Amazon 10 years ago. Or Netflix. Or Apple. Or Shopify. Or Bitcoin. No investment goes straight up forever. That's ok. If you're in a hurry to make money fast, then maybe Tesla isn't the right investment. Most of the people who made serious money investing in MSFT, AAPL, or GOOG, or AMZN, or NFLX, or FB, or SHOP, held on for a longer time horizon. If you bail because there are no short term catalysts (that you know of), or because the stock goes down short term, you may kick yourself later. Even Bitcoin dropped 80% 2 years ago (from its then all time high of $20k). People who bailed then missed a great opportunity.

n7cmlw,,investing,post,1620431992,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returnsRecent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?",['ARKK']

I can't recall another retail fund manager that has ever been in the press predicting literal % returns for the next 5 years (or 1 year for that matter.) A manager might say ""I expect a good year for tech"" if they're a tech fund or that sort of thing but I can't recall another mutual fund or ETF manager saying ""I predict X% annualized for my fund for the next 5 years."" I thought it was iffy when she did it earlier this year and now she's doing it again. So to me it's not even the math of the projections but the fact that she continues to do it in the first place.

She's really ""hyper growth all the time"" - the issue becomes it's not going always be in favor (and I think people took last year's unbelievable/once in a great while performance as confirmation/validation of hyper growth rather than possibly a ""grand finale"" - at least for a while - to cap off a decade where growth was largely the ""only game in town""), but she invests as if that's the case. Look at recently with her selling large liquid names into declines so she can buy even more of smaller, less liquid things a lot of which she already owns 10% or more of. What if she sells all the large liquid names and the decline keeps going? I wish Ark could be more dynamic in its approach - it feels like everything has to be hyper growth all the time or it's not ""on brand.""

""But even with such a team, there’s no sign that Wood would heed its advice. A central tenet of her process is to amplify exposure to the fund’s riskiest holdings when market uncertainty is highest. In a market crisis, her game plan is to sell first the fund’s “cashlike” stocks--those that possess the most diversified sources of revenue, are typically large cap, and are the most liquid--to favor as few as 32 “pure plays” that are often unprofitable small caps that are less liquid and extremely volatile.

She followed a much milder version of this playbook at AllianceBernstein’s Strategic Research strategy during the market’s 2008 implosion. There, she consolidated the portfolio to 47 or so stocks and kept it focused on liquid large caps. It did not have anywhere near the level of ownership in individual companies as ARK Innovation has today. In 2008, that large-growth-oriented separate account lost 45% before fees--substantially worse than the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 38% decline."" (https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1031702/ark-innovations-thematic-approach-is-ill-prepared-for-a-major-twist)

She's said that there will be declines/corrections, but she doesn't invest as if that's the case and those statements are offset by her very bullish long-term predictions. ""There might be some big declines, but listen to how well this is going to do!"" I said early this year on here that the performance was not sustainable as the discussion became more and more Ark-y on here.

https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1017292/what-to-expect-from-funds-after-they-gain-100-or-more-in-a-year-trouble-mostly (""What to Expect From Funds After They Gain 100% or More in a Year? Trouble, Mostly"")

 Additionally, how much of the money that has poured into Ark came late? The inflows really didn't start en masse last year until in the second half of the year when the funds were already up 100% YTD. Tons of new investors started earlier this year and I'm sure a lot of them went right to Ark, chasing last year's performance. 

""Money Tree"" seemed to be the peak in Feb. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree. ""**Ark’s exchange-traded fund assets under management crossed $50 billion this week, up from only $3.6 billion at this time last year**, according to data compiled by Bloomberg"" 

In terms of inflows, a Morningstar analyst comparing Ark inflows to Janus during that firm's dot com era success: ""What we've seen over the past year plus is equivalent to like 16 Januses during that firm's heyday."" (https://twitter.com/syouth1/status/1360958603746811907)","['ARKK', 'TWTR']"

Employed $3500 USD p/m

Objectives: Long term growth and investment / retirement

Time horizon 10-15 yrs

Risk tolerance: moderate

Holdings $6000 USD, no debt, $3000 USD liquidity

I'm new to investing. I just opened up a Singapore Saxo Trading account and I want to use it to invest in S&P500 and just DCA into it each month. I am expat based in Thailand and earning THB. Just wondering if I am going to get hit hard with currency conversion fees as I assume it will be THB > SNG > USD to be able to buy and also to sell.

I think the option to open a sub account in USD would get me one less currency conversion (i.e. THB > USD), however I am not sure if I have to be concerned about the inactivity fee for not making the minimum amount of trades over 6 month period (as main account opened is SG).

Lastly, for holding a SG Saxo account, is there any tax implications for that considering I am currently a tax resident of Thailand and not Singapore or USA? I assume I would be beholden to the taxation laws of Thailand.

I am considering to use Interactive Brokers as well but their monthly fee ($10USD) is not really appeal to me. Just hoping to hear from people with some similar kinds of experience as my brain is hurting.",['SPGI']

n7802u,,investing,post,1620418954,"Competition is Growing in the Telehealth SectorThe pandemic has changed a lot of things for good, including healthcare. Since the demand for telehealth skyrocketed in 2020, it’s been a super hot sector with not only a lot of investments, but a lot of new players in the arena. As I’ve debated on which company to put my stake in, I’ve always had an eye on Amwell. It’s consistently been under the target price since it’s IPO and I think there’s a ton of potential here.

Fueling my logic is a recent WSJ article about how PepsiCo has switched telehealth platforms. The company stopped using Teledoc for telemedicine services and now uses LiveHealth Online, a platform connected to the company’s health plan that also happens to be powered by Amwell technology. 

I feel as though this revelation flew under the radar. If Amwell runs platforms that integrate better with company’s current health plans, it could become a serious competitor to Teledoc. Head of benefits at PepsiCo, Erik Sossa, says “Telehealth is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity.” This is true and I think this statement will guide the “what’s next” in the telehealth industry. With so many companies entering the market, what will set each one apart? Making it easier on employers by integrating with what already exists is a great way to gain a step-up on competitors. 

I’ll be continuing to keep a close watch on Amwell. The stock can only go up from here—and many analysts agree. Numbers look good and recent news suggests that the company is headed in a great direction.

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index    fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately   determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * \*Edited: I should mention that when you make the trade you are paying a ""hidden"" fee of the spread between what you pay and what the stock was actually worth when you bought it as the Market Maker takes the split. Since you are either paying the spread, or management fees, you are going to be paying, you just don't have commissions on top anymore for the most part.
* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have  had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing  in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due    to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the    index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when  Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on  11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up  the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the  stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more  people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular,  that’s because it is.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies    with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a    sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies    missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech  seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this as    necessarily a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite    compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being    found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the [best of the best of the best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_huL5ynaI8Y)companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well    diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the    S&P 500.

Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This    seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each  other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE  below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I    ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.   Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less   than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will   likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical   issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were   also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they   could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750    stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks   were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the    industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4    years was compared to this index value with the following type of    breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For    example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was    10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,    they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they  would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would  receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The    relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there    was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth    only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be    decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This    left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the    company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently    in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them    being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?    Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude    them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These    26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and    September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these   stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total    purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The    chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested    dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of  returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850    tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.    The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More    metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were   then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to    determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to    median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of    the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3    stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over    the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry  is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that  benchmark.

Each   stock  was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics  and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score  out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics.  The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I  measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as  previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%.  Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular  metric to find a useful distribution.

I    also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the   metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this   ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a   score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9   categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a   company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could   do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t   match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or   the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the   analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I    applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at    the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock    that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a    high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,    I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their    financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off    their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly    leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that    Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns    Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great    synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of    this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,    such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil    and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated    \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a    separate model.

I then looked at    each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are    all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit    margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,    etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We    were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at  each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better    understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was    not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last  year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I  only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

Notes

* I    partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was  critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to  build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing  for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the   credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly    5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the    2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last  year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more  than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to  answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.

\*I    am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to   ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results   and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t    understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and    henceforth. You are welcome to do whatever you like with the    information, though if you’re going to sell it that’s some pretty messed    up \*\*\*\*.

n70yxb,,investing,post,1620400830,"Will business models like DoorDash, Instacart, or Uber Eats, ever be profitable?I increasingly ask myself how can these commoditized business models could retain some profits over the long term. They are all playing in an extremely competitive environment with the same modularized supplier (restaurants).

Some could compare these business models with Amazon, but Amazon is a huge exception and it has a by far bigger network advantage over the other competitors like Walmart, and Amazon doesn't have any head-to-head competitor with the same propositions. You don't buy a power bank on Walmart.

Why am I thinking this:

1) DoorDash, Uber Eats & Co. have the same product assortments, making these platforms purely interchangeable. Usually, the restaurants don't sell only on one platform but they are in all of them, and the skills/barrier of entry required to sell in a new platform are basically zero because they work the same, have the same fees, and don't have to do anything more.

2) They can only attract a meaningful profit only if they develop some form of advantage. Take Netflix, the only sustainable advantage they could have is to develop their own series/movies. Do you think is the same with the ghost kitchen? I believe that foods are purely interchangeable (except you have a differentiated brand like Whole Foods), not quite the same as a movie though.

3) They can compete with a better service, but it can be easily copied (and nobody has a substantially bigger advantage in network or scale), and there is also a limit on the convenience. Do you think customers care if one delivers the food 3-5 minutes before the other? Is it an enough competitive advantage for the long term?

The same thing applies to grocery deliveries like Instacart. BTW I'm huge bullish on Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods since 1) it controls the majority of the assortments with private labels 2) It controls the distribution 3) It doesn't need to spend $Bs in ads, hence lowering down the prices.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe they could ever be profitable? If yes, how? Looking to discuss with you.","['NFLX', 'WMT', 'AMZN']"

The premise that all of these companies raised venture funding on is that they will eventually be the last delivery service standing, allowing them to corner the market, leading the ability to raise prices, and finally leading profitability.

All of that is laughable for two reasons.

The market is not cornerable.  There is high churn in the restaurant industry to begin with, millions of small clients (restaurants) and virtually no ability to permanently and exclusively lock them in.  The same goes for consumers/diners - there is no opportunity for lock in on that side either.

Second issue is that demand dries up when you raise prices.  When $30 worth of food turns into $60 w/ fees, diners give pause and look for alternatives.",

Not only will this eliminate wages paid to the drivers but it will eliminate tips and will reduce the delivery expense for customers.

n6dh3d,,investing,post,1620324294,"I sold every share I own today.I got into the market last year post Covid around May or June. Since then it has been an absolute rollercoaster trying to pick stocks. I was up 100% on multiple stocks including Tesla, Carvana, Square, Fiverr. I didn't sell because you're supposed to hold for the long term I heard, only for those stocks and others over many months to drop 30% - 80% or more. I bought some new stocks in February only for them to then drop 30% or more in a matter of months. I have spent months this year and last inside on beautiful days going cross eyed staring at charts trying to figure out what stock to buy, what to sell, why this stock is going up, why this stock is going down. As we speak I'm sitting inside on a beautiful day writing this. I have admitted to myself I don't understand stocks. I don't understand businesses. I have reached a point where I stopped caring about losing money. That's a dangerous road I'm sure. With the amount of stocks I've bought and sold, I don't know if I'm up or down.

Evidence I don't understand stocks is that today Twitter is worth less than it was in 2013 when it IPO'd. One of the most popular social media apps in the entire world I would have assumed would be worth something. Apparently not. It may seem I'm impatient or have a short term horizon for the market, but if I bought Twitter in 2013, I would have wasted 8 years of my life holding it.

PLTR backed by Peter Thiel and signing multi-million dollar contracts week after week, well the bottom just fell out. While it will probably go back up, I don't understand when and why it would. If a company with that much growth potential can't go up, what chance does anything else have.

10 months ago I bought DKNG at $25 and sold a few months later for about $50. Today it's worth a little more than was 10 months ago. I'm glad I got out when I did.

n75u6r,,investing,post,1620413353,"Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls ShockGold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.","['PM', 'ED']"

First off, what is your percentage gain per year and what is your strategy to beat the market?  Also, if you have access to this data, what is your risk metrics such as Standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, Alpha, Beta, R squared.

My idea is that in order to beat the market, most people have to take outsize risks.  Me for example.  Here is my stats...

5 yr return:  37.78%

Standard deviation:  44.29  My account has high volatility

Sharpe ratio:  .83  My account's risk adjusted return.  My account has high returns but has had endure very high volatility to achieve those returns.  For comparison S&P Sharpe ratio for the past 5 years is 1.09.  Higher is better.

Risk adjusted alpha:  7.01 A risk adjusted measure that measure's excess returns over an index.  Higher is better.  I have achieved higher than average returns compared to the index

Beta:  2.06 Measures volatility related to an index which has a beta of 1.  Higher means more volatility.  My account has been very volatile compared to the index

R2:  .48 Measures correlation with an index.  Lower number means low correlation with an index.  My account has low correlation with the index.  

I know there are those out there who have beaten the index but have risk metrics that are much better than the I have.  Very curious about the strategies of those people who have beaten the index and have high sharpe ratios and lower standard deviation and beta.",['SPGI']

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210507005048/en/NuScale-Engages-Guggenheim-Securities-to-Explore-Financing-Options

I’m personally optimistic about the future of nuclear companies due to their potential contributions to any goals towards reducing carbon emissions. There’s no way we’re going to meet these targets without a large push to nuclear, and it seems like NuScale is the furthest ahead out of the new technologies. For example, they are the only SMR to have an approved design by the NRC, and I think it’s only a matter of time before they get more customers signing up to get plants in the US and around the world. 

Looking at Guggenheim’s history, it seems like they have steered similar companies towards a SPAC offering. How can I try and get in on any public offering if they are looking to go this route?",

The company generated revenues of $84.9 million (35% YoY) vs. $85.1 million market consensus. Net loss per share was $0.12 vs. an expected $0.11.

These are not big misses but make the company one of the few high-growth cloud players that underperformed market expectations.

However, the company also lowered its guidance for Q2: Fastly forecasts revenues of $84 - $87 million and a net loss of $0.16 - $0.19 per share, compared to the market consensus of $92 million in revenue and a net loss of $0.08 per share, thereby disappointing investors.

n6l995,,investing,post,1620344980,"The Roaring 2020s (Economy/Stocks)So.

Unlike a lot of naysayers who think taxes, inflation, or certain political parties will derail this train, I don't agree.

* [Personal Saving Rate | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-saving-rate) , savings rate has averaged 18.75%. FYI, the highest the savings rate in the last 20 years for a 12 month period has been 7-8%.
* [Total Revolving Credit Owned and Securitized, Outstanding (REVOLSL) | FRED | St. Louis Fed (stlouisfed.org)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL), people used funds to pay down their credit debt. Allowing them to take on consumer purchases into the future.
* $1.9 trillion COVID stimulus. Which contained much more than just $1,400 checks. It contained policies that will free people to join the workforce who otherwise would not, to start businesses, to direct capital towards areas long beaten down.
* \~4 trillion infrastructure, part 1 and part 2. Investment in R&D, Nationwide BroadBand, EV charging, Electrical Grid, Education, Renewable Energy, Childcare, Eldercare. These investments will allow for a huge increase in the number of people who can participate in the workforce.
* Booming Jobs growth. Expect to see sustained jobs growth over 1 million jobs a month in 2021, expect to see a long term jobs growth story of 300,000-400,000 every month for years and years.
* [Wage Growth Tracker - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) above inflation wage growth.
* [Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index) It is true that there is some increasing inflation showing up, even in personal consumption, but mainly due to isolated commodity supply chains. It hasn't shown up in food, despite what anyone thinks. Not in rents (increase 1.7% YoY, negative in many places). (40% of Americans rent), it hasn't shown up in the electric bill, in electronics, in cars, the one pain point has been gas prices. Which, continue to be offset by improving efficiencies, and in context, gas prices are lower than 2010. As far as buying a house, people paying up to buy homes are making discretionary choices that they can afford to make. People in existing homes (the by far vast majority of the 60% of households who own a home) are not experiencing much inflation, they have mortgages.
* So no. The Fed won't be raising rates. Commodity inflation will work it's way thru the system. Ala 2010. Oil prices dropped to $20, then bounced back to $110+. And many other commodities that were low in the financial crisis, only to rise very quick in the recovery.
* Stocks. So, the economy and the stock market aren't directly connected anymore in the US. See the financial crisis recovery. Stocks boomed, the economy chugged along gradually. See 2020. It was a hard real economy for 10s of millions. The stock market did not care. So, will a roaring economy mean a roaring stock market? I think, in the context of creating new retail investors during COVID, and now post COVID, who will be joining the workforce with substantial growth, an exaggerated inflation prediction that never comes to fruition in the long run, meaning low rates, and trillions more in spending, it's going to be a very good stock market.
* Taxes. Oh get over yourselves. High taxes have never meant the economy can't grow or the stock market can't grow. People (even the wealthy) adjust to tax changes and then keep doing what they were doing. The impact is short lived, both on tax cuts and tax increases. ""Tax increases"" happened in the 90s and the 2010s. That did not stop the stock market, or the economy.
* And it's laughable to call them high. The United States has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios of any advanced country. Yet trails in aggregate measures of education, healthcare, infrastructure, quality of life, environment. There's such a thing as lowering taxes for wealthy capital gains non labor earners too much. The US past that point in the 80s.

Conclusion. Get in losers, were doing the roaring 2020s. And they are mad that the poors have a better chance of capturing income in this decade.",

I've noticed that a good number of serious, professional and semi-professional intraday and swing traders focus on a couple of dozen stocks. My question is, do stocks have their own unique personalities, and if they do, what are the best ways to learn what they are?

A quick comparison between stocks in the same sector or industry shows that they move differently and have individual patterns. For example, one stock may frequently experience high volume on a Wednesday, another stock may close low on a Thursday.

Do they have personalities and how can these be identified, learned and mastered?

I remember there used to be something called the “superbowl” indicator where someone figured out that if a team from the old AFL won the superbowl it predicted with 90% accuracy what the stock market would do that year.  Of course it eventually stopped working so well because it was just the human brain trying to fit a pattern to random historical data.  The other thing is that even when there is a consistent pattern, if the pattern is detected by enough traders, the form of the pattern will be changed by their trading.

n6fysa,,investing,post,1620330775,"In just 3 months, Tesla has issued 80% of the shares ARK's valuation model projected they would issue through 2025.Their model is beyond amateurish.  Tesla share count at the end of Q1 was 963.3M, up from 960M at the end of Q4.  This is just 700K away from ARK's 964M 2025 projected share count.  

Those are only the outstanding shares.  They missed Tesla's diluted share count by over 100M in their newest model.  And before anyone mentions possible buybacks, their model already includes a $300 billion cash pile in 2025 to pad their EV/EBITDA PT.  No room for buybacks in their modeled capital allocation.

That's just what's provably wrong with the model.  Will Tesla create a human ride hail service with 3x more revenue than Uber in less than 5 years?   Will Tesla become the most profitable insurance company in the US in under 5 years?  Will Tesla sell sedans and crossovers at the same gross margins of Ferrari?  I can't say, but these are all standard assumptions made in ARK's ""bear case"" -- An odd context for the term.

I wouldn't be so crass if they actually learned from their mistakes, but they don't.  Their year end 2019 model projected Tesla would issue 30 million more shares through 2024; 900M to 930M split adjusted.  They issued 55M in 2020 alone.  34M were attributable to capital raises.  Maybe that would be a good time to step back and check what the diluted share count would be in the event Tesla hit their PT?  I could almost forgive a hobby investor missing the dilutive effect of, at the time, anti-dilutive convertibles and stock options.  Not a firm like ARK, but a hobbyist.  They brazenly miss their share count estimate, take no further look as to why they missed, and, by some miracle, totally miss the dilutive share count & effects plastered all over Tesla's filings since Q1 2020.

To be blunt, these guys are either dumb or deceitful.  To those who invest in ARK funds, this is the level of DD you get.  Caveat emptor.

n6klu0,,investing,post,1620343064,"According to Morningstar, only 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished positive in the previous decade (plus what I've learned over my 12+ years investing)Source:  [How Many Stocks Beat the Indexes?](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1035348/how-many-stocks-beat-the-indexes)

Recent posts about people losing their initial investments over the past 6-12 months made me think of this article that I heard the guys on the recent [Animal Spirits](https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/05/05/animal-spirits-we-should-be-in-a-bubble/) podcast discuss. Over the past 10 years, 42% of the top 5,000 US stocks finished in the black, 36% finished in the red, and 22% are gone. Of that 22%, Morningstar does acknowledge they didn't check to see if a company went bankrupt or was acquired at a premium/loss but they did note, ""Bessembinder’s research suggests that half the expired stocks were acquired, with decent results, while the other half were delisted, with dire consequences.""

Basically what this research shows is stock picking isn't easy and probably shouldn't be done by most people, if any. There's a reason mutual funds and active money managers have been shown to trail benchmarks over short- and long-term timeframes. [This IBD article from March](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-beating-sp-500-over-last-1-3-5-10-years/) shows only 25% of MFs beat their benchmark over varying timeframes. [This 2019 article from CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html) shows nearly 65% of active fund managers trailed the S&P 500 for the 9th consecutive year. If people who devote their literal careers can't do it, most retail investors probably can't either. It's just as much luck as it is skill. 

Note: if you don't give a shit about what my opinions are, do as my wife does and stop paying attention to me now. I only planned to post the above and then I just started jotting down thoughts that turned into more thoughts and the below was born.

If you want to pick stocks, probably the only hope you have is having a very long-term horizon and being diversified, but not diworsified. If you just want exposure to every industry for diversification purposes, just buy an ETF that tracks everything all sectors. 

Irony time: Save for my wife's retirement and our savings for future kid(s) (both of which I manage and both of which are in QQQ, SPY, and/or VOO), I pick stocks and although I have overall exceeded my chosen benchmarks (SPY and QQQ) over the past 9 years, I have no expectation that will last, which is why I benchmark. I ~~want~~ need to know how I am doing because if I absolutely suck and perpetually trail the benchmarks, I would be leaving easy money on the table. I don't want to do that so I manically track my transactions.

For me, I actually match the Morningstar numbers pretty well.

**Closed Positions**

|Beat SPY & QQQ|Beat one but not the other|Trailed SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|45%|10%|45%|

**Open Positions**

|Currently beating SPY & QQQ|Beating one but not the other|Currently trailing SPY & QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|
|35%|8%|57%|

Quick tangent. Open positions are doing worse right now because I continue to buy. I don't care about the isolated market choppiness currently going on (some of which I'm invested in) and I'm not sitting on a mound of cash waiting for a massive dip. I buy when I have cash ready and a company I want shares of. People seem to think entry point matters but it doesn't with a long-term view. Sure, $45/sh is better than $50 but what if it goes to $60 before that 10% drop you were waiting for. Now you have to buy at a higher price or live with the feeling you missed the boat (spoiler: you didn't; just fucking buy). Sure, some stocks will pull back to your entry point but if the thesis is good and remains in place, just buy when you can and add more when you can.

So if the majority of my positions are trailing at least one benchmark, how am I beating SPY and QQQ overall? To keep the theme going, having a long-term approach is why. I wasn't beating the benchmarks right away. In fact, it took 3 years before I was intermittently ahead of them and another 3 years before I was consistently beating them every month. Six years may seem like a long time to allot myself but, at the time, my planned retirement was 40 years away. I had a long runway to work with so I knew my risk profile could be high and I could continue to learn as I went along. I bought companies I believed would win over 10+ years and then I let my winners win. 

This is a divisive take but I rarely take gains on my winners. I don't need the cash now; this money was earmarked for decades down the road so I let it be invested. I even let some of my losers lose (looking at you Ford). I do everything I can to not micromanage my holdings. I monitor the news and quarterly filings but unless there's been a fundamental change in the business that renders my initial investment thesis moot, I hold. 

By letting my winners win, I allowed the SHOP's and the SIVB's and the AMZN's and the SMG's to make up in gains far more than my losers lost. Currently, my three largest gaining positions have increased in value more than all my losing positions (open and closed) **combined**. And those 3 largest gaining positions are all still open. I have never in the 5+ years I've been invested sold a single share in any of them and I see no reason to even consider doing so. It's cliched to say but the max you can lose on a stock purchase is 100% while the max you can gain is infinite. Don't overreact. Follow your thesis. I bought AMZN in June 2014 for $327.39 and it then traded basically flat for 7 months. Imagine having had sold that for a miniscule gain because I didn't see an immediate 35% return? 

All this being said, I absolutely understand why people would choose passive ETF investing. I enjoy reading about companies and perusing SEC filings. I view my investing as a hobby in addition to wealth building. Not everyone does. They may see the benefit of investing while viewing company research as work. Others may want to try to get rich quick. I would never recommend the latter but to each their own. I didn't hit it big on GME or AMC or become a Dogecoin millionaire but I also didn't FOMO buy only to lose 50% of my investment within a week and then panic sell. I'm not yucking anyone's yum. I just know the lane I'm comfortable in. Know your risk profile and how much you can lose without making your life uncomfortable, because any investment can drop 20% a day after you buy it and any investment can go to zero. You can't invest and also be undisciplined or prone to FOMO. You will almost always lose out.

I didn't mean for this post to turn into a soapbox speech but if it came off that way, my apologies. Just trying to convey some interesting research I heard/read with some lessons I have learned.

n6klu0,gxaqfnb,investing,comment,1620409257,"I'm a little conflicted by this line of argument. I recommend low-cost indexing to anyone who asks in my personal life, so I definitely support the broader argument here. Further, there are entire subreddits dedicated to [obvious scams](https://old.reddit.com/r/NKLA/) and other pump-and-dumps so there's clearly a need for this type of analysis.

On the other hand, it's so alien to my experience that it comes off to me as unpersuasive. I've probably held 50+ individual stocks in my life and none of them went defunct. Even broadening it to every company I've put on a watchlist, that number is still zero out of 200+ companies. The few delisted were products of M&A, and generally profitable for shareholders.

This article itself shows the numbers are vastly different for large companies, where 77% of the top 1000 companies by market cap made positive returns and just 7% are gone.  Further there's the minefield of Biotech stocks which decay steadily to zero unless they develop a profitable drug. [18 of the 32](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_stocksonly,ta_perf_52w75u&ft=3&o=industry) stocks down 75% over the last year come from this one industry - two more are generic drug developers.

Finally, even if stocks were exactly the unavoidable minefield described in this article, it's not a mathematically persuasive argument against active investing. After all, an active strategy could also include direct indexing where an investor owns merely *most* of an index. If owning just a few stocks is bad, then owning all but a few has to be the mirror image, right? You're effectively indexing + shorting a bad active strategy.",

I was thinking to invest in the S&P500 index instead of cherry-picking stocks (through Ireland ETF). The reasons are that my country doesn't have a tax treaty with US and to lower the risk of individual stocks.

But by looking into S&P index constituents there are many stocks that looks overvalued to me (based on PE ratio, I will assume that 25PE is a reasonable PE for value stocks for a time to come):

\- AMZN PE 62.25 - its earnings would have to increase 250% to reach PE 25. Through which business segment? Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.  Prime Video? Look at Netflix - new users do not add so quickly, I'm expecting this segment to have a low earnings increase. AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years. 

\- TSLA - while it has a strong brand the valuation that is higher than VW and Toyota combined is questionable. The graveyard is full of people who shorted TSLA although

\- V (Visa Inc) - PE 54.81 - debit card payments are now the norm even in third-world countries outside of the world. To reach 100% growth in earnings I think you'll have to wait long.

\- Mastercard - see Visa Inc

\- NVIDIA PE 83.98 - when crypto mania is over,  graphic cards would not be such a great business, compare this to Samsung's PE 21.35, Nintendo's PE 16.41 or TSMC 28.68

\- Adobe PE 42.26 - Adobe to grow more than Microsoft? Good luck with that. This is a business software company, compare that with SAP PE 25.27. There are some labor requirements that give Adobe an advantage so my guess is that 35 PE would be reasonable

>Internet sales - with covid over, people would spend more time in brick and mortar shops, expansion possibilities in new countries is very limited as there are local players.

I believe, COVID lockdowns have massively changed attitudes in important markets.

* Two years ago, it was completely normal for a store in Germany to only accept cash as customers didn't really need it to take cards. Now, everyone orders online and pays with CCs. While the growth will slow down a bit, we'll most likely still see faster growth in previously [cash-heavy](https://merchantmachine.co.uk/most-reliant-on-cash/) countries.
* After two years, even technologically challenged people were forced to adapt and recognize the benefits of shopping online. Even my mother, who's in her 60s, lives in Eastern Europe, and couldn't turn on a power bank with a single button, now orders 90% percent of her purchases from the local online stores. Without COVID Amazon had zero chance to sell to this kind of people.

> AWS - there are more competitors and many business are not so fond of paying to Amazon much more than what they are currently paying, I'm estimating possible growth of 10% Y2Y in the next 5 years.

* There's basically one competitor, Azure, which still has a long way to go to match AWS.
* Companies don't want to rely on Google as they are known to kill their commercial products on short notice without providing a replacement. This is reflected by their market share of about 5%, even though they've launched in 2008, two years before Azure.
* The rest are not even close. They may provide VMs / containers / storage, but they don't have the technology that makes the cloud migration to be worth it(like [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend)).

Taking the points above into account, we probably won't see a massive decline in AWS growth for a while.","['GOOGL', 'AMZN']"

Dropbox (DBX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.17 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Dropbox, which belongs to the Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $511.6 million for the quarter ended March 2021, surpassing the Consensus Estimate by 1.31%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $455 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

Dropbox shares have added about 12% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11%.",['SPGI']

n6jd81,gx9vyrr,investing,comment,1620396144,"I'm really interested in DBX, and need to do my own research on it yet.  My two biggest upfront concerns are that their growth appears to be declining, and I'm not sure if they've got a strong enough advantage to protect and grow their market share.

I need to look into the growth further.  However, it's concerning to me because they just reached profitability in 2020.  A quick look shows revenue growth could decline from 14% to 10% in the next 2 years.  That's down from 40% just a few years ago.

Their existing network of 15.5 million subscribers does give them a current advantage, and that number has grown on average by 1 million over the past 5 years.  However, I'm not convinced they can hold on to their subscribers with all of the other options out there.

I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on Dropbox.",
n6h23a,,investing,post,1620333552,"Peloton Interactive Q3: EPS beats by $0.10, beats on revenuePeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON): 

• Q3 GAAP EPS of -$0.03 beats by $0.10.

• Revenue of $1.26B (+140.2% Y/Y) beats by $140M.

• Q3 ending Connected Fitness Subscriptions grew 135% to over 2.08 million and paid Digital Subscriptions grew 404% to approximately 891,000; total Members grew to over 5.4 million.
Q3 Connected Fitness Subscription Workouts grew 239% to over 149.5 million, averaging 26.0 Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscription, versus 17.7 in the year-ago period 

• Q3 Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn was 0.31%; Q3 12-month retention rate was 92%.

________
Extra info:


• The company said it generated record quarterly revenue of $1.26B and a 5x increase in paid digital subscriptions, but the meaning of those results is far from clear after announcing yesterday that it had stopped sales and recalled its Tread and Tread+ treadmills.

• The company did not offer a full-year forecast with its results, but would provide revised guidance on the earnings conference call later today.

• For the quarter, connected fitness subscriptions and paid digital subscriptions jumped to $1.02B and 891K, both exceeding analyst consensus estimates.

• Peloton said delivery times for its original exercise bike have returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, but ""While progress has been made, additional work remains to reduce delivery times across the remainder of our product portfolio and regions.""

_____
Update:

• While noting that a recall of its treadmills would knock $165M off FQ4 revenues, CFO Jill Woodworth forecast quarterly sales of $915M and an annual total of $4B, not far off previous annual guidance for $4.08B in sales.

Tech earnings are receiving all the hype recently, and if you guys are like me, you’re looking for stocks to get into at low prices, and ride out the growth (we’re all aiming for the next TSLA). While tech like TSLA is always in the news, I’m starting to think more about COVID stocks and those who provide COVID related supplies, because let’s face it, Coronavirus is not over and spikes in India, Brazil, and even the EU are unfortunate examples that immediate medical response and prevention measures are still needed. 

Some may look at PPE as a summer 2020 trend but that is far from true and PPE stocks will continue to perform well. One that I came across recently is Optec International (OTC:OPTI), a manufacturing company of LED and PPE product. OPTI announced really impressive financials this week, [4391% YOY Q3 growth](https://otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Reports-4391-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Increase-for-the-3rd-Quarter-2021?id=301349) and revenue at $11 million. OPTI’s been making a slew of acquisitions, but one that I’m interested in is a company called WeShield. They have audited revenues of $55 million in 2020 and projected revenues of over [$100 million for 2021](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/OPTI/news/OPTEC-International-Inc-To-Acquire-WeShield-An-Established-AI-Driven-NY-MedTech-Company-In-PPE-Space?id=295925). The company says this growth is due to proprietary AI tech.  

Either way, OPTI is an example of an affordable PPE stock that I have on my radar, today they’re trading at around $0.09 a share. Other suppliers to keep in mind from an investing standpoint are 3M (MMM), DuPont (DD), and Owens & Minor (OMI) - these are top PPE manufacturers and suppliers. 3M is being traded at just under $200, with DuPont at $79 and Owens at $35. These companies are established healthcare suppliers with Owens & Minor, for example, being established in 1882. And like I was saying above, the demand for PPE IS NOT going anywhere. In April, Plastic News published an article citing Owens’ performance and stated that the pandemic will continue to boost the medical supply market as health systems expand their PPE supply. 

I genuinely think that PPE is going overlooked and that there are exciting new companies that will emerge in the medical supplier space. Interested in hearing other PPE plays or your guys take.","['TSLA', 'MMM']"

If he believed in Berkshire's future once he and Charlie are no longer at the helm, wouldn't it make more sense to leave her the money within Berkshire?

Edit: fixed some grammar and framing to be more clear",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx5z0cp,investing,comment,1620317867,"Approving the post.  It's not asking basic advice rather interested in sparking an in-depth discussion about a widely-influential, large-cap holding company.   A few observations I would keep in mind in this discussion:

1. Berkshire Hathaway is a hybrid business consisting of three components:  Its insurance/reinsurance business, its investment holdings (companies such as Coca-Cola where they are the single largest shareholder but not a majority shareholder), its wholly-owned subsidiaries (e.g. BNSF, NetJets), etc.
2. Berkshire's performance over the last decade relative to the S&P is also a function of the fact that within the last decade, Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK/B) shares were added to the S&P 500 and now comprise 1.44% of the index.  It is therefore important to include some discussion of how this impacts the index and vice-versa.  Their movement is now interdependent.
3. The key difference between Berkshire and various indices is not how they perform relative to one another only in a bull market, which is what the last ten years have been.  But how does Berkshire, through value investment, insulate itself against loss of principal.  There's a different risk exposure in bear markets, and this is evidenced by the fact that Berkshire's total performance from 1965 is still double that of the S&P.  It may not be useful to rely on 2010-2020 as the measuring stick because despite the 2008 and 2020 crashes, the market hasn't experienced a prolonged bear period or a catastrophic event like the crash of 2000.  To wit, the 1964-2020 performance of the S&P is a 10.23% CAGR vs. Berkshire's 20.0% (or 2,810,526% aggregate, 55-year performance).
4. Long-term performance discussion has to encompass more than 10-year timespans, particularly when discussing American-based companies, because of the two-term limit and the residual effects of outgoing administration policies, e.g. the 2009 Stimulus plan whose effects lasted well into the first two years of the following administration, of which only the latter one year is the new administration's budget and fiscal policy.","['KO', 'SPGI', 'BRK.B']"
n69kpo,gx5ude6,investing,comment,1620315933,"I think BRK is a great long term investment. Buffet follows a lot of traditional investing advice and one of the most general principles is the market goes up. This is often confused with stocks themselves always go up. But it’s different. The S&P is an index of the biggest companies so by definition it is poised to capture the markets growth. It can rebalance to accomplish that as needed.

BRK has a lot of stock holdings as well as a diverse set of companies it owns. So it feels like an index, but it’s not by definition always going to capture the returns of the total market the way a true fund would. The goal of BRK would be to beat the market but frankly the safer play would just be to capture the market. His wife will not go wanting with that strategy.

In terms of my own investments tho I hold BRK and it’s one of my few “forever” holds. They are diversified and strong but also have a huge cash pile to capitalize on market downturns. Over decades I bet it will continue growing and capturing value.",['SPGI']
n69kpo,gx60ird,investing,comment,1620318503,"There could be a number of things including:

* **UNDERLYING VALUE.** The underlying value Berkshire has to Warren is higher than to his wife. Not only sentimental value, but real total value. Warren is an insider who actively looks after and influences the decisions of Berkshire. His (1st or 2nd) wife might not have that investing experience, sway in the company, or likely that business/finance/accounting acumen to oversee the company and shares. Or even if she did, she might not always be of good health to do the constant homework on the company.

* **S&P500 are fixed**. I'm not saying BRK is better or worse than the VOO/SPY. Both have their advantages and both are awesome. However, BRK is run by a few individuals making decisions. Most hedgefund managers don't beat the S&P and even savvy investors can make mistakes (like selling airlines at the bottom, dumping WFC at the bottom, and holding cash instead of buying the dip despite [being the face of ""buying the dip""](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ilxnwo/yes/) rather than going all-in and leveraging up like degens on WSB). Per the last point, his wifey might not know what's going wrong, if there is fraud, if they are making risky bets, or doing poorly. The S&P500 is more ""causal proof"" in that it just sets itself against the index. There is still risks of misconduct and fraud, but at the very least the stock picks are locked, there won't be Archegos-type leveraging, and management fees are clearly shown.

* **Diversification**. Why have only BRK when you can have a bit more diversification by having both?

n69kpo,gx5wk5x,investing,comment,1620316833,"I think of Berkshire as a satellite holding--part managed fund and part value play that lets you get in on some great deals when everyone else is panicking.  The investment they made in Goldman Sachs in 2008 comes to mind.  That brings some diversification if the rest of your portfolio is in large-growth dominated index funds.  But for a core holding, you can't beat something like the SPY or VTI.  Over a long period of time, the indexes always win, but maybe in a panic, a deal maker / stock picker can add some value.",['BRK.B']
n69kpo,gx62vky,investing,comment,1620319497,"I think the ideal way to explain the difference between BRK and an index fund would be to look at the story of Amazon in 1999-2000.:

In 1999 AMZN was worth $100/share. One year later at the end of 2000 it was worth $10/share. What is interesting about this is that while the market valued amazon at 90%, Amazon the business was totally kicking ass, growing by leaps and bounds and demonstrating  the ability to turn a profit in the immediate future (with the company doing just that at the end of 2001).

What this teaches us is that companies that are well run and profitable and managed rationally can produce large profits even in market downturns. This is why you would want to buy Berkshire over an index: for wealth protection when the market isnt in crazy bull mode. Now Berkshire does not pay a dividend and they historically never have but that does not mean they \*couldnt\*. If we have lets say a very long term bear market, Berkshires holdings will continue to make profits and while those profits will most likely be used to buy back stock or just be redeployed back into the businesses but the \*value\* is there and if the market does not respect that increased value (by bidding up the share price) then they could pay dividends to give investors some cash flow. You buy Berkshire for their ability to pivot and be a sensible investment even when things arent great but even when they are great they will also make money. Contrast this with an index like SPY. Sure the top companies could all do the same things in a downturn but its a lot of companies with all different management so you cant really count on a monolithic and rational response.

The TL;DR is buy BRK if you want to be in the best risk adjusted position for an equity investment especially if you think a downturn is coming. your return will (likely) be less during the crazy bull market but not by much and especially over long term.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN']"

n6dntx,gx6vsvo,investing,comment,1620331436,"Valuing a company is always personal, it is about what and where you see the company going in your eyes and then transforming this into numbers.

Now you talk about valuing a company, FCF and market ratios in the same sentence, but market ratios refer to what the market values a company at, and that is already reflected in the stock price (pricing).

So do you want to price your company or value it (intrinsic value)? And to me it sounds like you want somebody else to do that for you (asking for a tool), but keep in mind that valuations reflect personal projections and can vary heavily based on whoever or whatever valued it.

If you want to actually learn how to value young/growth companies yourself, then I suggest this:

Generally a good way to value a growth stock at first glance is looking at the market cap and then looking at the revenues they bring in and seeing what the annual growth rate is for that revenue year over year. That is how you get the price to sales and assess if the growth rate justifies the valuation it is trading at. Then I would look into earnings and financial statements to see how the path to profitability could play out and what their debt to equity is and how much cash they are burning. Of course you should do a much deeper dive and look at their quarterly statements, look at their management and leadership, and the fundamental aspects of the business.

>Peloton recalled its Peloton Tread+ and Peloton Tread treadmills today, according to an [announcement from the Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury), the government agency that oversees most household products, citing safety hazards.  
>  
>The Peloton Tread+ has been linked to dozens of injuries to children, including one death. The recall notice states that “Peloton has received 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and/or objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones, and lacerations.”  
>  
>**The company also notified the CPSC that its newer Peloton Tread’s touch screen can detach and fall, posing a risk of injury to consumers.**  
>  
>**Consumers should immediately stop using the treadmills and** [**contact Peloton for a full refund**](https://www.onepeloton.com/)**.**  
>  
>**The Peloton Tread+ (previously named the Peloton Tread) has been on the market since 2018. A smaller treadmill, also named the Peloton Tread, was slated to go on sale May 27, with 1,000 units already sold in the U.S. as part of a friends-and-family presale.**   
>  
>The recall comes after the [CPSC, in April, took the unusual step of warning consumers](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/peloton-plus-tread-treadmill-urgent-safety-warning-cpsc/) with small children or pets at home to immediately stop using the Peloton Tread+. The company initially refused to recall its popular $4,300 exercise machine, according to a CPSC spokesperson, stating that the product was safe as long as users followed operating instructions.  
>  
>**The warning was based on reports of 39 incidents in which a person, a pet, or an object, such as an exercise ball, was sucked under the machine, leading to injuries in both children and adults, many of them serious. “These are more severe injuries than you would imagine with a treadmill,” the CPSC spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time, adding that the agency had not seen these types of injuries with other treadmills.**  
>  
>In light of the CPSC’s warning and the severity of the injuries, [CR removed the Peloton Tread+ from its ratings](https://www.consumerreports.org/product-safety/safety-concerns-prompt-consumer-reports-to-remove-peloton-tread-plus-from-ratings/) and stopped recommending the product while the investigation was ongoing.   
>  
>The treadmill’s safety risks first became apparent in March after [Peloton CEO John Foley wrote to](https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-) users of the exercise machines regarding an incident with the Peloton Tread+ that led to the death of a child. Foley advised consumers to “keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times” and to “remove the safety key and store it out of reach of children” when the treadmill was not in use.  
>  
>The widely publicized fatality prompted the CPSC to request information from Peloton, and the company disclosed to the agency that there were additional injuries and incidents tied to the Peloton Tread+.  
>  
>**As the CPSC investigated the reports, including disturbing** [**home video footage of a child being sucked underneath the Peloton Tread+**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) **(and escaping without serious injury), the agency asked Peloton to recall its treadmills. But Peloton refused.**  
>  
>Shortly before the CPSC’s public warning, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked for details about the CPSC’s investigation and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., urged Peloton to issue a recall.  
>  
>The standoff with Peloton illustrates that the CPSC cannot force companies to issue a recall without taking them to court, even when the agency’s safety experts have tied a hazardous product to deaths or serious injuries.  
>  
>“The CPSC took a strong and principled stance for safety, and clearly that’s what made Peloton come to the table and agree to offer a full refund,” says William Wallace, CR’s manager of safety policy. “It shouldn’t have required so much time and effort to get this product recalled. This episode underscores why we need to overhaul our outdated laws, so the CPSC has the ability to take quicker, forceful action when a product is putting people at risk.”  
>  
>Acting CPSC chairman Bob Adler said in a statement today that he is pleased that the agency and Peloton have ultimately agreed on recall terms. He added that the recall “is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers.”  
>  
>**Peloton CEO Foley apologized for the company’s initial response to the safety issues, and stated that “the decision to recall both products was the right thing to do for Peloton’s Members and their families. I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.”**

\- Maybe a comparable to analyze its growth against another company either in the same or adjacent segment.

\- Growth prospect and how to estimate it.

\- A best method at coming up with a price target given the above estimates.  Should it be a range.  What conditions should be attached to the price?

\-  Execution - given that the arrived price target is obviously a rough  estimate at best, best approach to use it.  That is purchasing all at  once, or add to the position as the company proves itself, i.e. if there was any know how as to what strategy works as opposed to what makes sense.

**SUMMARY:**

In short, Ant is exploring ways to allow its  Xianghubao service, a form a crowd funded medical insurance that translates to “mutual aid” or “mutual treasure”, to be regulated without shutting it down, as there are fears that this could lead to social or political unrest, particularly from the ordinary citizens who rely on the service and have already contributed towards others’ payouts, which have totaled over $2.5 billion in payments to nearly 117k individual members. These concerns are being exacerbated by the fact that Xianghubao has been steadily losing customers since the Chinese government scuttled Ant’s IPO in November, raising worries that current members will be unable to receive money for claims or will have to pay substantially heftier premiums for continued coverage. 

For the last few years Xianghubao has been operating in the regulatory gray area of “mutual aid” products, which it did to avoid the regulatory requirements that come with being labeled as an insurance product. However, over the last year China’s insurance regulator has been increasingly critical of mutual aid services, and several other large players have exited the area entirely.

All of this is occurring under the backdrop of Chinese insurance companies working with local governments over the last year to expand or complement China’s existing public health insurance system with their own affordable health insurance options; and with Ant applying to become a financial holding company under the purview of China’s central bank.

n5yd5o,,investing,post,1620272502,"Am I missing something or is F massively undervalued?Hi r/investing,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I’m a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it’s the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it’s undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

Since I am new to value investing, am I missing something here? Or, is this a good pick to buy-and-hold?","['TSLA', 'PEG']"
n5yd5o,gx5iiqs,investing,comment,1620310822,"Approving the comment but with some guidance:  Even though the stock is undervalued, I encourage you to come to the table with a more thorough analysis.  A thorough discussion of valuation is going to do more than look at various ratios of earnings.  For example:

1. What's the FCF-based fair value?
2. What's the delta of Ford's forward P/E in each of the past five quarters to its actual P/E?  In other words, how much did positive earnings materialize into stock price appreciation?
3. What is the historical and forward P/E comparison to Ford's peers?  The automotive industry is exceptionally capital intensive with not staggeringly high margins.
4. What are the risk factors unique to the automotive industry?  Investors have been as shy of automotive stocks as they have been of airline stocks, two industries that required a LOT of public subsidy over the past five decades, and are now facing a transformation challenge: spurred on by the $2 billion settlement of VW AG over its emissions scandals, automotive makers have an incentive to convert their production to EV's but at what cost?  Is Ford ahead or behind its peers in this regard?
5. There's not a lot in their financial statements that looks glaringly bad (some commentary on non cash items, discontinued operations and capital lease obligations is welcome but not materially significant) but a few things should be at least commented on including that three of the past five quarters they posted a net operating loss... Granted, that owes to the pandemic but when we look at history, even before the pandemic the stock price never rose above $14 per share and hovered for quite a while around $10, currently trading at $11.5399.  So the market's not really moved the price even remotely close to the FCF fair value in the last half decade... What implications might that have for the expected return?  That may or may not matter depending on the type of value investor you're pitching the question to, but it's got to be addressed so they can weigh it.

There are, I'm sure, many other questions that can be raised if given more than the five or six minutes I glanced at the company's data... This is just an example of the kind of questions you should anticipate.",

n5v0cr,,investing,post,1620261362,"Teladoc Stock is Down Another 8% This Week. Don’t Just Blame Poor Earnings.""The stock has been under pressure for the past few months since the firm signaled that it [expects little membership growth in 2021](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teladoc-stock-falls-on-downbeat-forecast-for-membership-51614267007?mod=article_inline). A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.  

But the latest selloff isn’t just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‘s former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn’t connected to PepsiCo’s existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients’ health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it’s just late-night urgent care, it’s kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo’s shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm’s health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

n5w1a9,,investing,post,1620264703,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DDVista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock.  But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns’n’ammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones.  The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington’s ammo business).  This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government.  Those people all buy ammo.  Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap.  The national ammo shortage still persists to this day.  Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online.  It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend.  They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings?  Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades.  They’re the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day.  Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter.  Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6.  Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping.  But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog.  Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it’s not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high.  Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b.  About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK.  Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends.  I’ll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33.  Long-term bullish.  I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!).  So I'm posting it now.  Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock.",

n5lead,,investing,post,1620235477,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3)For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor  
**Resolution 2:** I made 3 copies of the sheet in hopes of spreading out the odds of getting in  
   [Copy 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o_UjmNI7Zxm76QN3HQ-_cwx3lZ8QbTogyqYTY1oRC9E/edit?usp=sharing), [Copy 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDRkAGtRrXql5RQ-l68cD5lE3XoBMNv3oJsHb_3JK38/edit?usp=sharing)
3. **Resolution 3:** I published them to the web for those that can't get into the files themselves  
   [Link 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml), [Link 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNy-pbbipZSMcp3ppBMuDik0hGqh1iqg6yLi1p22IHFsh2VtJgXn_l3LmqX0KUAu-WkhHxYve0jP4i/pubhtml), [Link 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS0i8hyUhW08s6_coWXjnV593xDipk5ttZJq3yB3heqXF92HMspHU5-gvD4q8cTsiA7TehjeAobCayH/pubhtml)
4. **Resolution 4:** Create downloadable Excel copies. These are locked in at 05/05/21 so won't be updated after that, but I left instructions to update it yourself

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them.",['GOOGL']

n5jbxh,,investing,post,1620230375,"Limiting turnover in levered portfoliosAfter spending a bit too much time reading  ~~papers~~ marketing pieces from AQR, I'm fully convinced that a ""balanced portfolio"" (ie less stocks, more bonds and alts than the 100/0) levered up to the risk of stocks should beat the pants off everyone's favourite 100/0 while cutting the tails somewhat, even with realistic financing costs and transaction costs  (cursory look at Alpha Architect's ~~material~~ sales pitches for high turnover products)

However, I'm not exactly sure how to implement this because...

1. Leveraged ETFs suck
2. Futures are better, but you're realizing your gains/losses quarterly/monthly, which creates substantial tax drag.
3. Not adjusting your leverage up/down with the market opens you up to blowing up your account in a crazy 4 sigma tail event (no matter how well diversified you are) even though you could have survived it by adjusting leverage downwards as the value of your holdings fell and up as the recovered (which, by my limited understanding, is what almost all risk-parity funds do...)
4. I'm pretty sure I can't go down to my local investment bank and ask them to make me my own TRS.
5. ITM LEAPS also cause tax drag and they aren't too liquid if I want international or factor exposure.
6. Not crazy on NTSX.

So, how can I ideally just buy ETFs as the core of my portfolio, get the cheap financing rates of futures (box spreads seem to fill this role pretty nicely, but open to other suggestions) while not having to realize my gains or losses while still keeping a relatively constant leverage ratio?

Rebalancing with inflows is definitely an option, but a prolonged sell-off could mean that the portfolio's leverage would be drifting up faster than me adding cash could bring it down.

Does anyone have any (systematic, ideally) strategies to ""rebalance"" using futures to offset positions (ie selling some ES contracts when SPY drops to reduce exposure to stocks when they drop while getting more exposure through ETFs as they recover?) or anything else that solves my conundrum?

Or is simply not using much leverage and praying that you never see a catastrophic, 1929 level loss in your lifetime (or the 20 or so years you would be using leverage before delivering as your near retirement) the only option to limit turnover and the associated tax drag (so not adjusting leverage at all).

Or am I missing something else entirely?",['ES']

n5jbxh,gx1mkfe,investing,comment,1620233029,"If you buy ETFs financed with margin or box spreads, you could realize losses to prevent the leverage ratio increasing over your target. I know you said you did not want to realize losses, but you could use the losses to realize gains (and step up your bases) by selling and buying similar but not equivalent ETFs to make sure those losses are not wasted.

Now might not be the best time to start a leveraged portfolio combining stocks+bonds. The portfolio works best when stocks and bonds are negatively correlated - we have flight to safety to bonds when stocks drop, we have a Fed dropping rates when things are scary, and we have minimal inflation (which may cause stocks and bonds to be positively correlated). Right now inflation may be a risk and the Fed may not have room to drop rates any lower. Any thoughts on this?

This Fed power is far more effective than money printing. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. Powell doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity.

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation.

I hope I'm wrong, I  but it made me nervous because I do have quite a bit of cash on hand (10k+) that I'm holding to find an investment opportunity. Here's what I found with a bit of research:

1. Real Estate - I already own my home. Buying rental properties in my area doesn't make sense because of how crazy the market is. I also have no interest in being a landlord ever. 
2. TIPS -Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. I found a few ETFs (STIP, LTPZ, TIPZ). Is this a good play? Would you suggest one of these ETFs over another?
3. Crypto - A lot of people talk about crypto as a commodity which typically go up during periods of inflation. I already own about $10k of BTC and $3K of ETH which have done really well for me. I am bullish on Crypto. 

Is anyone else here feeling this way? How are you positioning yourself if inflation does rear it's head?",

1. Real estate - the theoretical market isn't infinite but limited by access to capital. How does unemployment and rising inflation squeeze the buyers market and force more people to rent, what's the impact of the ratio of loans that are above tolerable debt-to-income levels (e.g. National Mortgage Risk Index).
2. TIPS - If this is a good play why is it a good play relative to the other two, especially...
3. Crypto - is this really investment grade?  What's the valuation metric?  If its entire attraction is its insane volatility how is it useful for its primary purported utility—currency—when it lacks the things a currency must have, namely stable store of value and standard of value (you're going to convert it back into a government backed security at some point)?",

That will make your position almost delta neutral and protect against any downside because if SPY is down by 10 points, your unrealised gain on SPY is 10*50= 500 USD.
This will also mean MES contracts  (which is 5*future value of SPX) will have fallen by 100 points. That will mean MES contract has gained about 500  USD

Stock futures are mostly flat this morning. Tech is seeing a bit of selling, with the Nasdaq off 0.3%.

This follows a day of reopening optimism that lifted retail stocks. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will fully re-open on May 19. Florida is open effective immediately.

So the rotation trade is apparently back. Not much in the way of economic data today. Factory orders at 0830. We do have a bunch of earnings: CVS and DuPont just beat. Later we have Pfizer, Activision Blizzard, Akamai, and some oil majors: ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum, Dominion Energy, Devon Energy. 

Oil is up this morning, by the way. Crude up 1.8% to $65.50, another post-pandemic high.

I'm currently a 26 y/o engineer based in the Bay Area with a $160k salary. I currently have about 250k saved among my 401k (\~82k), Roth IRA (\~13k), and Brokerage account (\~155k). My 401k is all in on FXIAX, and my IRA is all in on VTSAX. My Brokerage is split 80% VTSAX, 20% VTIAX, and I'm consistently adding about 3k per month at this split to my account. My goal is to eventually buy a home in the Bay Area, which can be very expensive. Not sure when I'd like to make such a purchase, but I'm thinking within the next 5 years. I would also like to retire early if possible (no set age in mind).

n4ggw4,,investing,post,1620104626,"Index funds or stock portfolio?It is common advice to simply invest in a low-cost mutual fund or ETF for the S&P 500 index or perhaps for the whole market.  Warren Buffet says ""I do not think the average person can pick stocks.""  Certainly it makes the most sense for many people to simply pick standard index funds for their 401(k), for example.

But what about the ""better than average"" investor?  Yes, I know that it may be presumptuous to assume that I could do better than professional fund managers, but it seems that it shouldn't be difficult to find companies within the S&P 500 that beat the average more often than not.

To test this idea, I took a look at the S&P 100 (not the full 500) and how each company did compared to the average over the past 10 years.  I picked the companies that consistently beat the average over the full 10 years, 5 years and 3 years.  Using a similar weighting as the index itself, I came up with the following portfolio of 20 stocks:

* **Communication Services**: GOOG, DIS, NFLX
* **Consumer Discretionary**: AMZN, TSLA, NKE, HD
* **Consumer Staples**: TGT, COST
* **Financials**: MA, V
* **Health Care**: UNH, DHR, TMO
* **Information Technology**: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, ADBE
* **Industrials**: HON, UNP

I did not choose any companies from the Utilities, Materials, Real Estate or Energy sectors, but collectively these entire sectors comprise 10.1% of the S&P 500.

This portfolio would have performed *significantly* better than the index over the past 10 years.  Even if you remove TSLA, the returns are about 3x over the index.

These are all well-known companies, many of whose products or services I use on a regular basis.  I know that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"", but it seems to me that that these high performing companies are more likely to continue to beat the average than not.

For an investor that is willing to keep an eye on their portfolio and make changes when necessary, instead of forgetting about it for 10 years, why wouldn't a bucket of stocks like this be a better choice than an index fund?  Why should we settle for the average instead of going with companies that are consistently better than average?","['NVDA', 'SPGI', 'AAPL', 'TGT', 'NFLX', 'UNH', 'MSFT', 'ADBE', 'DHR', 'TMO', 'TSLA', 'UNP', 'AMZN', 'DIS', 'HD', 'NKE', 'HON']"

https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d

>	**Credit Suisse made just SFr16m ($17.5m) of revenue last year from Archegos Capital**, the family office whose sudden collapse in March caused the **Swiss bank $5.4bn in losses**, according to people with knowledge of the relationship.

>	The paltry fees Credit Suisse received from Archegos, **whose implosion was one of the most devastating in recent history**, raises further questions about the risks the lender was prepared to shoulder in pursuit of relationships with ultra-wealthy clients.

>	Archegos, which was run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, **borrowed tens of billions of dollars from at least nine global banks to speculate on volatile stocks**. The lenders have collectively lost more than $10bn in the fallout.

>	**Despite extending billions of dollars of credit to Archegos, Credit Suisse made just $17.5m from the relationship last year**. The low level of fees and high risk exposure have caused concern among the board and senior executives, who are investigating the arrangement, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

>	The bank’s management is particularly **alarmed after being told that Hwang was not a private banking client of the group, suggesting there was little incentive to pursue his prime brokerage business**, the people said.

>	Credit Suisse also demanded a **margin of only 10 per cent for the equity swaps it traded with Archegos and allowed the family office 10-times leverage on some transactions**, according to people familiar with the trades and first reported by Risk.net. That was about double the leverage offered by fellow prime broker Goldman Sachs, which took minimal losses when unwinding its positions.

>	Credit Suisse has had to raise $1.9bn from shareholders to shore up its balance sheet on the back of the losses, while staff bonuses have been cut.

>	On Friday, António Horta-Osório was confirmed as the new chair of Credit Suisse and promised an urgent review of the bank’s risk management, strategy and culture.

>	“Current and potential risks of Credit Suisse need to be a matter of immediate and close scrutiny,” said the former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive. “I firmly believe that any banker should be at heart a risk manager.”

>	Credit Suisse’s board had already removed several senior executives, including chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, and investment bank head, Brian Chin. Andreas Gottschling, who led the board’s risk committee, was forced to step down last week in expectation of a shareholder backlash.

>	Thomas Gottstein, the bank’s chief executive, has also announced it will cut a third of its exposure in its prime services business, the specialist unit that serves hedge fund clients and was at the centre of the Archegos crisis. The two heads of the prime division have also stepped down.

>	Credit Suisse does not disclose the amount of money it makes from its prime services division, but JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein estimates the unit made $900m of revenues last year, just over a third of the total from its equities business.

>	Abouhossein said the prime brokerage generated bigger profit margins than other parts of the investment bank. “We see shrinkage as a material setback for the overall long-term viability of Credit Suisse’s investment bank,” he added.

>	While Credit Suisse is the biggest European provider of prime services, it significantly lags behind global leaders Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan.

>	The largest investment banks pulled in $15.2bn in prime broking revenue last year, slightly less than the $16.5bn they made in 2019, as hedge funds reduced their borrowing during the pandemic, according to Coalition Greenwich, the data company. European banks accounted for less than a third of the revenues.

n4tc5v,,investing,post,1620147449,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab PlayIntel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.","['INTC', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'IP', 'TSLA']"

I wanted to take the bull side, because I do think its undervalued, but wallstreet doesnt like companies that essentially stay flat or slow grow, they like huge growth potential, or shorting them into bankruptcy. Like take a look at Intels historical performance, even when they had x86 domination and AMD was nearing bankruptcy, wallstreet did not care. I'll probably sit on the sidelines for now until I see a good buying opportunity and then hold them for a minimum of 5 years.

**Now to counter points:**

>In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1

The figure I saw was Apple accounted for 3% of revenue. Not that big of a deal. However the M1 itself is concerning, it shows ARM can meet or beat x86. However its also a special situation, Apple has more money than god, and poached talent from every top semi, the more important factor though, is Apple has a cult like brand, they can convince developers to willingly create ARM versions of their apps. On the Windows side, that was an utter failure with Surface RT, and most companies are not going to want to redevelop software, external or internal for ARM, unless they are HUGELY incentivized to do so.

>failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm

Yes, this is obviously a sore spot and still a concern going forward. 7nm is like 5 years late, its not good by any means. 10nm had bad yields and wasnt ready for prime time at launch a few years ago either. However 10nm is literally in mass production right now for Alder Lake, which is a big launch, not a niche product, this is its prime time. And I shouldnt have to explain this to people, but Intel 10nm is equivalent to TSMC 7nm, which is what AMD is currently using. 7nm was reiterated to be on track for 2023 by Pat last week during the earnings call. Intel has historically given us bad time frames, but I can only go with what is said and known. By late 2022 AMD will be on 5nm, so once again, node parity is coming.

>while others are working on 3nm

This is TSMC for Apple first for next year. Nobody else is at that level, There are only 3 leading edge fabs, TSMC, INTC, Samsung. Samsung being the worst of the 3 and expected to actually fall behind Intel when Intel gets to 7nm.


>and has even been overtaken by AMD

Yes, but caveats. AMD has the node advantage for similar products right now, that changes with Alder Lake (later this year), and AMD really only beats Intel in highly threaded applications, like Blender, anythings that maxes out under 8c/16t, like video games, daily use, is a wash. Credit to AMD for catching up, but its not like they are years ahead of Intel. Also this is just at the high performance end, marketshare wise, as of Q1 Intel has 80% marketshare of CPU sales, so despite their slipping high performance consumer CPUs, and some data center, they still dominate in sales.


>Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy.

Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

Yes fabs cost money, and Intel cant exactly stay flat with revenue. Thats where IDM 2.0 comes into play. They will be designing semi-custom chips and fabbing them for whoever, they said they will open up their patents and fab whatever people want ARM, RISC-V, x86*, etc. Its entirely possible someone like Nvidia ends up using Intel fabs, since the margins are going to be better than TSMC. Its *one* of the reasons Nvidia went with Samsung this generation. Point is, the fabs arent be created to sit. They are expanding because they think they can grow. Also in 2025 they plan to fab lidar sensors, for mobileye, their division that is currently partnered to supply ""13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs"" BMW, Volvo, Ford, etc.

>Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. 

I agree, but what happened happened. They made mistakes under past leadership, they missed out on supplying iPhones with chips, they botched their late to the party smartphone chips, had node issues. All we can do is judge what happens going forward, and I dont think being #2/#3 in the fab space is that bad. And until China figures things out, nobody is going to contend with the 3 leading edge fabs.

>That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

I think its more of 2020 and China mixed. Intel now realizes how fragile the semi industry is. Taiwan is going through a drought, tensions are high with China, Covid. One major issue and TSMC is crippled, and every company comes knocking on Intel and Samsungs door. I also wouldnt be surprised if going forward some companies hedge against possible issues and get two fabs to produce for them at once.

>Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap.

A white flag? Intel recognizes the position they are in, they can provide the US and its allies something that none of the other leading edge fabs can. Sure they are losing to TSMC, but that doesnt mean they are heading towards failure. If they can get $50b from Biden, why wouldnt they take it? You think TSMC isnt subsidized up the ass by Taiwan? That Samsung isnt heavily tied to the South Korean government? They are all playing the same game. Intel has probably taken the least subsidies buy its government. But now they are willing to play that game to the fullest, hence why Pat is reiterating every chance he gets that stock buybacks will be suspended and that China is a big threat to Taiwan, and that Intel is national security.

**My very short take on why Intel could have a growth spurt in a few years:**

Mobileye: Like I said above, they are partnered with 13 of the top 15 car manufacturers (and even more smaller ones like NIO). People will want some form of autonomy in their future car purchases, probably more than they care about EV, but EV sales are all about tech and autonomous features really show off how modern your EV is. Tesla is doing their own thing for themselves (they once used mobileye), and Google's Waymo CEO says there current plans are to retrofit Chevy vehicles with the system.. So Mobileye is going to likely be the biggest autonomous player. Companies could jump ship, but I dont think they will or want to. Like I said before, Mobileye once used to be Tesla's AP, then allegedly the companies had a falling out when Tesla wanted use it in unsafe ways, too early in development. So Mobileye is playing it safe, and more importantly, IF there are lawsuits or issues, the finger isnt pointed at one manufacturer, and data collection will be better for training the AI. Also at some point there will absolutely be regulation to make some form of autonomy a requirement in new cars, just like airbags, backup cameras, etc. Car accidents are the #1 leading form of death in the US that isnt from a medical issue or suicide, its still a huge deal. 

Basically I think mobileye might grow into one of Intels biggest divisions, since from the looks of it now, they will be the brand behind most autonomous cars.

IDM 2.0, This is a new take for Intel, it turns their fabs into contract services. There is money to be made both by fabbing, and by licensing IP to go into chips being fabbed. This pivots Intel from mostly being a CPU manufacture of their own products into a CPU manufacture that is also a leading edge fab for hire. This opens up the doors to things like next gen consoles, fabbing for Nvidia, fabbing for qualcomm, custom silicon combining x86 and ARM on one package for data centers, it has HUGE potential, but it depends on where the nodes are at and what customers than can acquire. This is a change that shouldve been made the moment Global foundries exited the market. Also its not like silicon demand will ever stop, it will only grow, I believe they can handily take customers away from Samsung, TSMC is another issue, but if the market is growing, they dont have to have a proposition that is able to beat TSMC, it would be great if they did, maybe they will catch up, but there is plenty money to go around. Take a look at TSMC's margins, they are healthy and only going to go up starting with this chip shortage.","['INTC', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'QCOM', 'IP', 'TSLA']"

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

P**reamble:** The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

https://preview.redd.it/ir6jqgjwsay61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d057f55015d8e25479815bfe760d4dde81240de6

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

 At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

If you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/75nyoa5ltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5b27919716360fdbaf31f4548f4d21e0401b49

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below. 

https://preview.redd.it/xing6reltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9c3d13abbb8b060fecf8cee7b312bbdfd6efaf

These are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades

https://preview.redd.it/k4r34rpusay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=084ac821754d87d42d2f1ac9b822a9015125a443

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years. 

https://preview.redd.it/igyz3jwdvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=223b91d21b9201211a21ea24ec2daee0627b9166

The top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators

https://preview.redd.it/fd66tjagvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e92ab79c5b7316eb95e70dc22bed0b2f8615127

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

What is your financial goal? How risk-sensitive are you? Answering these questions will help to set you up for eventual success and develop your individual asset allocation strategy accordingly.

Let’s get to the facts: actively trading stocks, and timing market entries and exits come with inherent risks. Missing the best 10 days in the market between 2010 and 2020 would mean an overall decline of 33% (see [*Bank of America chart*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html) below). Moreover, it is unlikely you sell your assets right before a crash and buy back at the bottom. In most cases, the worst days are followed by the best days which would put you back on square one holding your cash waiting for the crash.

### Strategies to Pick Stocks

Although stock-picking follows a more active approach, long-term investing means being active 1% of the time while leaving your portfolio alone for the other 99%. It is important to keep in mind that less than 10% of all public companies drive 100% of long-term stock-market returns. Therefore your mission is to find the 10% and patiently ride the wave.

Some hands-on advice:

* **Limited diversification**, as you cannot continuously research each company you are invested in on a regular basis. The range of 10-15 stocks is healthy, otherwise, go back to the previous section and consider passive investing.
* **Flexible & innovative companies** can adapt their business model and expand their market potential. The companies with today’s highest market caps all have this trait in common.
* **Don’t ignore what is familiar**, in 1966 Walt Disney was valued at $80 million and they just produced Mary Poppins turning over $30 million alone on that movie. The company was well-known and anyone could have picked up a few shares. $1000 invested back then would average you over $4 million today.
* **Know your strengths** and profit from them. If you are mathematically gifted then focus on the fundamentals. If you work in the industry and know the competitive landscape and product lineup, do that. Find your own style of investing.
* **Google is your friend**, look up the approval rate of the CEO on Glassdoor, read job reviews, check the company’s premises on Google street view and go on the investor relations site of the company. You need to do your own due diligence because nobody physically audits the business you invest in.
* **Leadership and the CEO** are decisive for the long-term success of a company. If the leader of a company is also its founder and owns lots of stock in it, the interests are aligned with the other shareholders and hence money is invested more efficiently.
* **Human** **resource management** such as low employee turnover, revenue per employee, diversity, inclusion, and so forth.
* **Deep dive into the company**: How does it create revenue? What is its market potential? Market growth versus the overall market potential of S&P500? What are the competitive advantages? Cashflow structure? Insider selling? Check on earnings calls, shareholder letters, and sweat the fundamentals a little bit.
* **Impact**: Does this company contribute to a better future?
* **Don’t overpay** because even great companies can be too expensive when too much of their future earnings potential is already priced in. Microsoft’s revenue was 3x higher in 2009 than in 1999 and still, the stock had lost 50% of its value in that timeframe.
* **Avoid** owning a stock you can’t explain or you lack conviction in.
* **Double down** on companies that you are convinced are great investments for the long run even if you already own shares. If the business proves viable and returns are increasing, then it is likely to follow that trajectory in the near future.
* **Hold & wait**: trade as little as possible to avoid taxes and to enjoy the runups. The shorter you hold an asset the greater the chance that you have to close the position at a loss. The magic of compound interest will do the rest for you.
* **“Don’t lose money”** – Warren Buffett & treat every dollar as an investment.

I believe that beating the market is possible if you are patient and willing to invest time. After all, the business world is like a car race. In the last quarter of the race, it becomes more evident who might win, and your odds can be calculated with minimized risk exposure. Then you invest in the top-performing racers and still reap much of the benefits.

Keep in mind that most stocks underperform the market. The outsized gains of a few winners are pushing your portfolio higher and make up for any losses on the way.

## Cash

Oh, sweet cash sitting ducks in my account, what am I going to do with you? At current rates of around 1% (if even) it would take 70 years to double my money. By that time it is more likely that I am buried 6 feet underground. I wouldn't even get to experience my slim gains.

Yet there is some upside to holding a percentage of your overall portfolio in cash. Besides, you can’t pay your expenses off by handing out your stocks. Holding some cash is in both active and passive investing approaches detrimental. I advise holding approximately 5-15% of cash as it allows you to:

* Leave your portfolio in peace
* Remain calm during market volatility
* Jump in when prices are low and be opportunistic in the markets

Buying stocks in times of recession has historically brought about outsized gains for investors. It is worth remembering, the more it hurts holding some cash in market booms the more likely you will profit from a swift down-market. The best time to hold cash is when it really hurts to do so. Holding cash allows you to be prepared, and you don’t have to worry about timing the market.

n99h60,,StockMarket,post,1620664461,"$HNST - The Honest Company - Currently Overpriced But An Honest Long-Term Investment**An Honest Summary on the Honest Company:**

* After starting the Honest Company ($HNST) back in 2012, Jessica Alba has finally completed the IPO last week, which saw a great public debut. Since the IPO, shares have continued to decline due to underlying growth slowing down quite significantly and growth stocks taking a back seat for now. 
* The overall sentiment is great, the core mission is well supported, but sales multiples are high compared to blue chip stocks such as Proctor and Gamble ($PG) and others.
* $HSNT has generated over half their sales from digital growth and the remainder from retail such as Target, Walmart and Amazon. Increasing brick and mortar through the economy opening up and capitalizing on increased digital age presents a positive story.
* While the long-term story is there, I believe investors could benefit on both sides of the trade. It's my belief that downside will continue until $10-12/share, at which point I will enter into a long position. My exit rate would be at $35/share, which represents \~200% ROI and 65% since IPO levels. 

**Fundamentals & IPO Discussion**

At the initial IPO, $HNST aimed to sell 25.8 million shares in a price range between $14 and $17 per share, with final pricing set above the midpoint of the offering range, at $16 per share. It's important to note that a smaller portion of these proceeds will benefit the company with almost 6.5 million shares sold by the company and the other shares offered by selling shareholders. Since there were 90.5 million shares outstanding following the IPO, the valuation comes at $1.45B. 

The underlying results reveal a rapidly growing operation, certainly in this segment of the marketplace.

* The company generated $235 million in revenues in 2019 on which a $31 million operating loss was reported.
* Revenues rose 28% in 2020 to just over $300 million as operating losses narrowed to $13 million.
* The $1.45B valuation translated into \~5x forward sales.   

   * The historical rapid pace of growth demonstrates a reasonable multiple but competitors are trading in a smaller forward sales range. 

Glancing at the quarterly results, we have seen some well established trends throughout 2020.

* The results have been a bit rocky with first quarter sales up 36% as growth slowed down to 16% in the second quarter, when the pandemic really hit.
* Growth accelerated to 38% in the third quarter, only to slow down to 22% again in the final quarter of the year.
* Another interesting point is that nearly the entire operating loss was ""booked"" in the fourth quarter, suggesting that growth might be slower than perhaps anticipated, even if it surpasses the $300 million mark already on an annual basis.

The momentum from the 4Q2020 continues to fade if we look at the initial 1Q2021 results with sales seen at $79MM which suggest 10% growth. At the IPO levels of $21/share, or $1.9MM valuation, the company starts to trade above 6x forward sales. Compared to blue chip names such as Proctor & Gamble ($PG) whose valuation is supported at $370B and 4-5x sales, the Honest Company starts to look a bit overpriced. $PG has very high margins and some organic growth but most of the profit is from their great track record of margin. The same is to be said for other competitors in the industry, most of them trade between 3-5x sales. 

**Short To Medium Term Bear Case** 

Competition is the main key concern as big brands are launching smaller brands to capture the movement. Their resources, marketing power and knowledge is very good; creating formidable competitors. The appeal of the brand is very high and the relative sales multiples in combination with the valuation do actually leave potential for a take-out of the company as well as some blue chip names might miss the boat on this trend.

Risks include the fact that these are higher end products which makes them more susceptible to economic conditions, as the brand reputation is a key asset as well. If we start to see the economy opening up and consumer spending on the rise, it could paint a better story. The biggest risk in the short run is the rather dramatic growth slowdown over the past two quarters.

As stated above, I am in doubt on the high multiples in terms of sales representing a premium over major peers. The Honest Company is also growing at much slower pace. In the short to medium term, I believe this stock will see $10-12/share as we learn more. If shares dip and if second quarter growth can be maintained and accelerate a bit, I might be inclined to start initiating a position, but the valuation seems too rich given the cooled down operating momentum.

I will look for further declining share price over the second quarter and wait until earnings week to initiate a position. I believe the real growth starts once we learn how they will mange growth, margins and forward sales.","['WMT', 'PG', 'AMZN']"

OTCQB: WINKF  
FWB: L7C2

Summer drilling season is coming up soon, this is the time when announcements and revenues are generally made. Since 2004, the company has added value to over 30 client discoveries and more than 80 target generation projects around the globe.

Stock price has a strong upward trend that is keeping its support level in tact. Higher highs and higher lows are formed. Its still early in its cycle but that's the best time to get involved, before the mania leaves the station. Short-term is possible but this seems more of a long-term place in order to fully grasp and let the AI discovery industry bloom.

Came across a mining discovery company called Windfall that is using its own AI to learn patterns in the earth's surface while using MCubiX-KE data mining engine.  
This data can result in a rapid ability to identify underground targets with high accuracy from minerals, groundwater and even buried explosive devices. So far they have be a part of over 85 discoveries.

I can see this translating to many different applications. Lithium potential, the gold sector, even all the way to clearing mines for the military / defense companies.

Today a release confirmed the efficiency of concept by reducing the need to explore 150km squared by 90% to focus on just 10km squared. 11 targets were found with over minimum target of 0.2g/t gold and 6 g/t silver. Find the report here:  
[https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1kWVFm6mP-windfall-geotek-delivers-ai-targets-for-capella-minerals-copper-zinc-gold-silver-kjoli-vms-project-in-norway.html](https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1kWVFm6mP-windfall-geotek-delivers-ai-targets-for-capella-minerals-copper-zinc-gold-silver-kjoli-vms-project-in-norway.html)

The achievement here is reducing initial costs of future production. This will allow a faster payback period in order to reap profits. Can apply to any mining company in any stage.

Pretty interesting stuff.

I think this concept here is truly organic and positive for the planet. Everyone whether they know it or not will be impacted, in a good way.

All this sounds cool, because it is, but the best part is the main input as a raw material is the most abundant resource and most concerning issue on the planet today. Greenhouse gases.

As we all know, the planet is getting clobbered with the amount of GHG that we are producing. All the cars, trains, busses, agriculture, food, manufacturing, and everything in between. We have managed to block out the stars in major cities because we produced such a smog cloud from emissions. Pond has more than just this reason, but it aims to help reduce all those nasty GHG from getting any worse, with Algae.

The patented technology Pond Tech uses allows them to operate scalable operations that use GHG and exhaust waste from gas, fluids or solids. from almost any source. Its heart-warming to hear that another company has found a way to provide better world for those coming after us.

Initially it was only algae, but now they platform grew to have a capability to apply the same concept to greenhouse farming or the cleaning of contaminated water.

Assets are strong at almost 10M to 7M liabilities. Half of that is in equipment and property. Debt is very current in order to scale business after proven ability and concept.

As the chart shows, the price has dropped after both of these events and these earnings moves were sold regardless if it was a gap up or gap down after the news was released.

As far as longer-term goes, over the last year, there have been 40 analyst ""buy"" ratings vs. only 6 analyst ""sell"" ratings with the stock price being up about 25% from last May. In this case, this suggests that there may be delay in analyst ""buy"" ratings and price action reflecting the bullish sentiment over the longer-term side of things.

Here are the results](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/). I reach some of the same conclusions, but am looking at some different metrics and strategies and using the next day's open price rather than the closing price from the day he makes the pick.

TL;DR - there does appear to be a benefit over SPY from repeatedly buying, holding for 1 day, and selling his Buy picks, or for shorting his Sell picks for the same time period. For income generation with fixed capital (not reinvesting gains/losses) there also appears to be a slight benefit from holding his Buy picks for 3+ months.

[Main results, showing a benefit from buying his Buy stocks and selling in 1 day or from shorting his Sell stocks and covering in 1 day. Much more detail below, but ignore the orange bars there's insufficient data to draw any conclusions there.](https://preview.redd.it/iw692odufby61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=85fa5a327603e905d6e704421e75a33f1866d887)

I'm a long time Reddit lurker (decade+), who finally made an account a few months ago, and now finally decided I should probably actually contribute something every now and then. Because of that where I can post is limited, so I hope this goes through. I'm not expert on stocks or finance, but I know a lot about data and algorithms. I've set up my own scripts for analyzing various strategies, including a few stock picking services and my own weekly algo swing trading strategies.

# Data

Thanks to the pointer from [u/nobjos](https://www.reddit.com/u/nobjos/) to the Mad Money picks, I was able to run my scripts on Cramer's picks. Like mentioned in the original post, the site doesn't exactly make it easy to get all the data. It's kind of like they just want to give the appearance of being transparent. Imagine that. But, I think I got all of it (as of today). 19,251 mentions of 2,068 stocks. (data is from [Mad Money Stock Screener](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm)).

258 stocks didn't have data available in the yahoo finance API, all returning with ""No data found for this date range, symbol may be delisted."" I'm assuming symbol changes also apply here, but I was pretty surprised to get that for > 12% of the stocks.

None of the dates on the website include the year, so for every pick I get the price for that month/day combo for each year since 2016 and use the year with the closing price closest to what's given on the website. There's potential for error here where a stock happens to be around the same price on the same date in multiple years. As far as I can tell the screener covers the past few years.

There are 5 types of mentions in the data: Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive Mention, and Negative Mention. I ignored which segment the mention was on. He rarely makes Hold mentions, so there's not really enough data for that one to draw any conclusions (I considered dropping it from the results altogether, and did end up clipping it in places to zoom in more on the others). Honestly, I can't fault him for that. If you own a stock, and you wouldn't buy it if you didn't, then you should dump it and buy something you believe in. Unless you're just trying to avoid a tax hit.

|Mention type|Count w/ valid data|
|:-|:-|
|Buy|10,808|
|Positive|2,588|
|Hold|30|
|Negative|2,623|
|Sell|1,848|

My goal with these scripts is to see how a strategy performs over time (e.g. does it work well for a week and then tank, are gains / losses optimal or most stable after a month, etc.). So I get the price on the pick date, then see how it performs for various subsequent time periods. ***For Cramer's picks, since he makes them after market close, the price I use for opening the position is the open price of the following market day. This is a key difference to the original post's analysis, which used close price from the day of the pick.***

I look at 3 things: the percent change (labeled 'Del' in my data), the percent change vs. SPY (labeled 'RDel'), and the percent gain if shorting vs. going long on SPY (labeled 'SRDel'). E.g. if a stock went up 3% and SPY went up 1% then Del = 3, RDel = 2, and SRDel = -4 (because you did 4% worse than you would have by just buying SPY shares). I'm constantly on the fence about whether I should use SPY or QQQ (or maybe even VTI) as my benchmark, but SPY is what's most commonly used and it's not hard to make comparisons to others afterwards based on how they performed vs. SPY.

# Evaluation

There are a few ways of looking at returns for something like this. The most common is the arithmetic mean we all know and love from basic math. If one stock gives you a 100% return and another gives -50%, your average is 25%. This evaluation works for a strategy of investing in multiple stocks at once with a buy and never sell strategy. Take $200, split it across those two stocks, the end result is $250 (a 25% gain).

[Basically all of his mention types perform the same \(remember, ignore the Hold type\) for this strategy. This chart basically just shows that in general, yes, stonks go up.](https://preview.redd.it/hxmez9olfby61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=035494223980f864ddbaaf47f2062aae09cd5cd6)

For shorter term trading, where we're investing in multiple stocks sequentially, we need the geometric mean. Take $200, invest it in the +100% stock, then sell and invest in the -50% stock, and we're right back at $200, a 0% gain. This is the result the geometric mean of 100% and -50% would give us (calculated as the geometric mean of the multiple of capital remaining, 2 and 0.5, minus 1). 

It's also important to note here that the metrics relative to SPY are the difference in the geometric means of the picks and of SPY, not the geometric means of the differences. The latter would produce invalid results and be impossible to calculate if any differences were < -100% (geometric mean is only valid for values > 0).

[With this strategy we do start to see a bit of a difference between mention types \(still, ignore orange\).](https://preview.redd.it/45qeotakfby61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=06cf6a25ed6ca5603b13ecfc646989022225b915)

Seen in the middle chart, at time periods of 3 months or longer the Buy mentions, and to a lesser extent the Positive mentions, do outperform SPY by a bit and the Sell mentions underperform (but not by enough to make shorting them a viable strategy).

But we also need to consider how long we're holding. Of course we would much rather have 10% gain in a month than in a year. So this final evaluation is what I consider to best reflect how the strategy would behave in practice. For this I take the arithmetic mean of all stocks picked on the same date, then the geometric mean for a given time period, then compound the interest for however many of that time period exists in a year to get the effective annual return. Note that I consider the time intervals to be the number of market days, e.g. a week is 5 days and a year is 253. This strategy assumes gains and losses are applied directly to our invested capital. So for the 1D time period, you would split all money across all picks from the previous evening, buy and sell after 1 day, then continuously repeat.

[With this strategy, things really start getting interesting \(no really, ignore orange\).](https://preview.redd.it/g5x62w5qfby61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeb989bb59b16e4804ae1a74ae426f540b7e5eb7)

At holding periods of 1 day the Buy mentions (and interestingly, the Neg mentions) significantly outperform SPY, and shorting the Sell mentions does as well. Shorting longer than a day is a terrible idea (it usually is Melvin), and the Buy benefit has dissipated within a week only to re-emerge slightly when looking at 3+ months. Remember these values show equivalent annual returns.

Keep in mind that this is likely to be a volatile strategy. Like counting cards in Blackjack and shifting the odds from slightly against you to slightly for you, you can still win or lose big on any given hand. But play a huge number of hands and you should win overall.

Based on the results I decided to also test whether buying his Buy picks a month later after the hype has died down and then holding for a few months would produce good returns. This approach didn't perform as well as the buy (or short) and hold for 1 day after the pick strategies, but did get slightly better returns for buying and holding for longer time periods.

[Compounding returns if waiting till a month after the pick to open the position \(the x-axis is then days the position is held open rather than days since his pick\). And at this point I really wish I had just eliminated the Hold mentions from the data.](https://preview.redd.it/a61nzeabgby61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5f7dff0502d40fdfd107b2f3f38fe9c12ed0571)

# Conclusion

The data from this analysis is here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZfOif0R3hmOnmfcLOCy1\_-K9yFrLo2e/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZfOif0R3hmOnmfcLOCy1_-K9yFrLo2e/view?usp=sharing). This includes every single pick, along with the aggregate values (arithmetic, geometric, compounding, and count) at the bottom for each pick type. The aggregate values are what's shown in the charts. This also includes results looking at > 1 year, but there's not as much data at those time ranges and those results are more likely to be affected by the year matching problems mentioned earlier. Another quirk you might notice is the count of data at 1 day post-pick is slightly less than at 3 days... I haven't had the time to figure out why.

My biggest hope in doing this was that I would see a pattern that I could reliably short his buy picks at open the next day after it pumps AH and then cover at close or a few days later. That doesn't seem to be the case. I would get crushed doing that and the most viable strategy from this analysis is actually to buy his Buy picks at open the next day, then sell and repeat every day. Shorting his Sell picks for a day also seems to be viable and could be a decent hedge for in case the market tanks on any given day. Using AH trading to try to better time entry points could further improve this strategy.

Remember, though, that all this shows is that doing that would have outperformed SPY, without taking into account taxes, commissions, short borrow rates, etc. In the last few years a blind monkey throwing darts at a tech stock board would have beaten SPY. QQQ outperformed SPY by \~30% in 2020, and if I had used that as the benchmark the buy and hold for 1 day strategy likely wouldn't win.

Outside of shorting his Sell picks for 1 day, the SRDel results are terrible pretty uniformly across all mention types. Generally, shorting over long time periods is, and it definitely would have been in 2020. My hope was to be able to briefly short Buy mentions after he pumps, but that doesn't appear to work (at least not as of market open the next day... shorting in AH a minute after he mentions it might work, but I don't have that data).

I didn't go through this with a fine-toothed comb for errors or other issues, so if anyone sees any issues with the data or analysis please let me know. Also remember the >12% picks failed to return anything from the yahoo finance API, and there's the issue with matching the year.

As I mentioned, I set these scripts up to analyze some other things I've considered, and just kind of pointed them at the Mad Money data. In the future I'll try to provide something similar for Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers, TipRanks SmartInvestor, a system I found called StockSignals, and maybe some of my own machine learning based picks at some point (they've actually done fairly well so far, but I don't have anywhere close to enough data yet to trust them). I'm open to other suggestions as well - all I need is a list of stocks each with a date and I can run this. I suppose ARK picks might be another good one to try.

Anyway, I hope some people find this useful. I think now I'm supposed to say something about this not being financial advice and that I have no idea what I'm doing. And I probably am on the spectrum somewhere.",
n98vgm,,StockMarket,post,1620662999,"How important is your average cost?Just a general question when it comes to stocks and crypto.

Say I bought 100 shares of Stock X at $1 share. It's going good, shooting up and it hits $10. I decide based on my analysis and projections, I am going to buy another 100 shares at $10, because I am really confident it's going to continue to rise. 

So now instead of 100 shares at an average of $1 a share, I have 200 shares at an average of $5.50 a share. ($100 + $1000 = $1100 , $1100/200 shares = $5.50 a share) I think my math is correct there.

Am I hurting myself doing something like this? Is my average really that important? My view is I still bought 100 shares at $1, so I am making money off them, and then ones I bought at $10, I am still making money, but obviously not as much as the ones I bought at $1 a share. 

Reason I am asking is someone tried to tell me that you should not buy stocks or crypto  at a higher price than your average because you are losing money by bringing your average price up. I thought the average was just a calculation for your knowledge  and does not directly have an effect on the money you make or lose. Like if you take my example above, if the price of stock x goes down to $9 a share after my second purchase, I am obviously losing some money, but I still have 100 shares I bought at $1 that I am way ahead on.",

n97g45,,StockMarket,post,1620660150,"$ZKIN we look for a correction higher, possibly testing $5.40.Since the last 15m outlook the price of ZKIN has fell by 6% as it's being valued slightly above $5 per share.

We've expected in our previous analysis that the price will move towards a test of $5.60, which break of could easily reach $6 per share.

At first try, the price action wasn't able to break above previous local high at $5.47, causing the price to test the support of the flag pattern.

Support failed to hold and the price broke below it, however this dip attracted buyers and a break of $5.60 happened.

The break of $5.60 led to extended gains to almost $6 per share, as gains were capped at $5.97.

Impressive volume has arrived, however the price action wasn't able to sustain above bespoke resistance at $5.60, which led to a selloff.

Currently the price is still under selling pressure and has created a new lower low at $5.06, luckily just a $0.03 lower than the previous one so nothing too significant. As long as we don't see a drop below $4.80, the price should just be fine.

Current price action won't tell us anything about possible reversal, however the 5 minute time frame seems to be forming a falling wedge, which we've seen previously.

RSI is creating a bullish divergence, an inconsistency between the oscillator and the price action. The price action has created a lower low while the oscillator created a higher one. This fact is pointing towards a correction to the upside to occur.

MACD is in a really significant selling wave, however such strong pressure has never been able to sustain for an extended period of time base on the chart history. We look for selling volume to falter from now on.

Overall trend unfortunately wasn't able to sustain in uptrend as the price broke below both 20 and 50 EMA, meaning the short term is a strong downtrend, but an overextended one calling for an oversold correction to the upside.

n91w8g,gxlwp8c,StockMarket,comment,1620655058,"There is no easy explanation because understanding depends upon a deep prior knowledge of options and credit strategies. Essentially a collar position is created by buying (or owning) stock and by simultaneously buying protective puts and selling covered calls on a share-for-share basis. Usually, the call and put are out of the money. For example, 100 shares are purchased (or owned), one out-of-the-money put is purchased and one out-of-the-money call is sold. If the stock price declines, the purchased put provides protection below the strike price until the expiration date. If the stock price rises, profit potential is limited to the strike price of the covered call less commissions. It provides stability against losses at the cost of preventing gains and incurring transaction fees.",

This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/kactomp8f4y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6c1d86da25f65e45c413ddbda1525e1641f3d4

GME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/uehk0zqbf4y61.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b72059fbded021f4d9af34cfcf7f8f6076aa419

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. 

  
**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank.

  
**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment.

  
**Sos($SOS)** stock experienced a significant rally and then a drop this week after reporting more than 300% revenue growth. The major cause for concern here is that 84% of their revenue came from a single customer.

  
**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report.

  
**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

n8epd3,,StockMarket,post,1620568541,"DraftKings (DKNG) Due Diligence - The ""King"" of Online Sports BettingOne lucrative industry is going through massive growth caused by the speedy de-regulation and legalization throughout the U.S. This market is… Online Sports Betting (OSB). We will be taking a bird’s eye view into the one and only DraftKings.

**Why DraftKings?**

DraftKings is already a market leader with roughly 20-40% market share (this varies by state). Their main competitors are FanDuel who has yet to IPO. Close 2nd and 3rds are Dave Portnoy's Barstool app and BetMGM.

FanDuel and DraftKings have such a huge lead in front of the market because they've been able to transition their Fantasy Sports apps into OSB. This is all about branding. When you think fantasy sports and the possibility of being able to bet on them it's only natural you think of DraftKings, FanDuel, or now Dave Portnoy who is becoming more relevant with Barstool. DraftKing's branding started years ago with their entry into the fantasy sports market and they are now plastered on all things sports.

Sports-betting is still a small piece of the pie when it comes to anything Casino or gambling, but the covid lockdowns have started transitioning the legalization of Online Sports Betting at a faster pace. This is the result of massive policy changes that help both DraftKings increase their addressable market and eventually governments who will also take a cut via taxes.

The way it is:

Governments taking people’s money directly from taxes = BAD.

Governments legalizing lucrative industries and taxing the crap out of them = GOOD.

The Online Gambling industry is set to go through hyper-growth over the next 10 years. Here’s a forecast done by GrandViewResearch

What makes DraftKings an alluring investment? For the most part DraftKing's revenues are RECURRING. Remember, although this is ""gambling"" many people enjoy OSB as a hobby and losing (or winning) money is all part of having “fun”. The goal of most online gambling apps/companies right now is all about user acquisition and paying whatever it takes to secure their market share. This is a tactic for those with deep pockets and willing to spend as the cost of acquisition per user racks up FAST. The two ways these companies are acquiring customers are through:

1. Huge marketing and advertising expenditures. This includes things such as having their brand name displayed in the background during athlete interviews or on the banners at live sports events.
2. The second and equally expensive route is by offering each user a bonus just for signing up. These are normally along the lines of ""play with us today and we'll match your initial deposit up to $50""

You can see how both these marketing tactics come with high costs, but as long as these companies keep their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) lower than a user's Life-Time Value (LTV) they will be laughing all the way to the bank. It's like saying they will spend $100 for a customer that will eventually provide $200 in revenues.

**Closing**

In my opinion DraftKings is the Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts of the online gambling industry. You are investing in THE main brand when it comes to sports betting. Although with expensive costs allocated to marketing they are securing market share in an industry that is going through a massive de-regulation and shift in policy changes. Does their current valuation match the TAM and expected growth? That's for you to decide, but at least know that you are investing in one of the top players in the OSB market with one of the strongest brand names out there.","['DE', 'SBUX']"

It’s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF’s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden.
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report.


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I’m good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car!

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you’re bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. 

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I’m sure you’ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that’s why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that’s some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn’t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery’s and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he’s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216.

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you’re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don’t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.

I **used to have** several SPACs (VIH, HOL, SFTW, NSTB, CLOV) and other speculative positions (DRRX, PCTI, SKLZZ, RBLX) in this portfolio and as a result, I incurred \~18%+ loss in the last 3 months. Overall I am still in green from the total capital I have invested, but the last 3 months erased a large portion of my gains from last year. 

I aggressively trimmed my speculative positions and added MSFT, AAPL, and doubled down on some of my high conviction names, even though those are still risky (MP, PLTR, COIN). 

The concern I have is confirmation bias, so I would like your perspective on what names I should still consider adding or changing to get this whole portfolio to grow 18-20% annually. 

This portfolio still has IPOD and IPOF and with it being near NAV, I am still thinking to just keep it in case one of them turns out to be a winner. 

I don't have any genome/biotech names here. Should I consider those? Or should I add names like FB, TSLA? Or double down more on some of these?

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
> The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&P technology sector.
*****
> The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
> The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
> “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
> Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
> The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
> Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
> The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
> Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
> “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
> # Tech battleground
> The S&P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
> In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
> Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
> The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
> Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
> “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
> “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
> Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
> “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
> Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
> “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
> Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

> # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

> After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

> As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

> While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

> While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

> In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETF's (ARKK) holdings, we created a custom portfolio that members can add here. Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKK's holdings as of 5/6/21.

> As always, investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities, and this chart analysis is in no way meant to be a buy or sell recommendation.

> # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

> As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

> Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

> To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

> # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

> Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

> Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

> “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

> Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

> # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

> One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

> With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

> Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

> “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&P 500 Index earnings growth.

> So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

> # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

> The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull.png))**

> With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

Hi guys

I saw a [screener](https://www.reddit.com/r/SentimentInvesting/comments/n36roq/improved_python_screener_for_finding_explosive/) last week and I made some modifications so it found general high potential stocks. It finds emerging stocks on social media (i.e. more mentions than usual) with rising sentiment:

`import requests`

`import sentipy`

`from sentipy.sentipy import Sentipy`

`token = ""<your app token>""`

`key = ""<your api key>""`

`sentipy = Sentipy(token=token, key=key)`

`metric = ""RHI""`

`limit = 96 # can be up to 96`

`sortData = sentipy.sort(metric, limit)`

`trendingTickers = sortData.sort`

`stock_list = []`

`for stock in trendingTickers:`

`yf_json = requests.get(""`  
[`https://query2.finance.yahoo.com/v10/finance/quoteSummary/{}?modules=summaryDetail%2CdefaultKeyStatistics%2Cprice`](https://query2.finance.yahoo.com/v10/finance/quoteSummary/%7B%7D?modules=summaryDetail%2CdefaultKeyStatistics%2Cprice)`"".format(stock.ticker)).json()`

`stock_cap = 0`

`try:`

`volume = yf_json[""quoteSummary""][""result""][0][""summaryDetail""][""volume""][""raw""]`

`stock_cap = int(yf_json[""quoteSummary""][""result""][0][""defaultKeyStatistics""][""enterpriseValue""][""raw""])`

`exchange = yf_json[""quoteSummary""][""result""][0][""price""][""exchangeName""]`

`if stock.SGP > 1.3 and stock_cap > 200000000 and volume > 500000 and exchange == ""NasdaqGS"" or exchange == ""NYSE"":`

`stock_list.append(stock.ticker)`

`except:`

I mean I don't want to say I'm an Asshole but here I was trying to do valuations on companies income statements. What a dumb ass I am. Has anyone ever told you about GME?",
n8iu7s,,StockMarket,post,1620580918,"Need help with understanding stock market basics. Is it a good idea to buy stocks that have been heavily shorted?I have been following along with the news and many hype videos for GME and AMC made by people with much deeper understanding of the market than I have. It seems to follow a logical pattern based on the contract nature of shorting the particular stock. Hedge Funds borrow tons of stocks, resell the stocks flooding the market with sell orders, this drives the price down until it's time to buy them back up to give back to original lender. When buying back up the price jumps back up because supply and demand mechanics. This seems especially true for the gme and amc situation due to popularity and widespread coverage making a massive amount of people aware of the short.

So my question is, assuming I understand the above correctly, is it generally a good idea to buy stocks that have been heavily shorted? I'm assuming the pattern plays out and when the contract is about to close the stock will rise again. So buying the bottom of the dip will lead to good profits later. 

Am I understanding the concept correctly?",

n7l183,,StockMarket,post,1620463914,"Nine tips for reading Annual Reports by an Accountant 

Nine tips for reading Annual Reports from an Accountant. Annual reports often run into 100's of pages. Here is what you need to know.

Thread 🧵⬇️

**1. Read Back to Front.**

Miss the glossy marketing pages and skip straight to the numbers. Before reading what the managers say about how well they have done, it is a good idea to have formed our own opinion.

**2. Focus on Profit**

There are so many ways profit is calculated the directors can be talking about a completely different number to the one considered most relevant.

Check the profit adjustment items under

* Exceptional
* Non-recurring
* One-off

Decide if they should be included.

**3. Even Better Focus on Free Cashflow Over Profits**

The best investors don’t spend huge amounts of time looking at a company’s profits. Instead, they spend a lot of time looking at its free cash flow in order to work out how good or bad a company’s shares might be as an investment

What is free cash flow? In layman’s terms it is the amount of cash that a company has leftover every year to pay its lenders and shareholders. It is essentially a company’s cash profits. Or essentially the cash which can be extracted from the company, whilst the company still maintaining its current growth.

**A sign of a company with high-quality profits is that it turns a large proportion of its profits into free cash flow**

**4. Check the Segmental Report.**

When a company is changing shape, using cash flow from one division with limited prospects to build up another which will diversify and grow its revenue. The Segmental report highlights this.

**5. Check the Remuneration Report.**

This is where executive pay is disclosed. Excessive pay counts against a company in my evaluations. It can mean the board is more interested in filling its own pockets than rewarding employees and shareholders fairly.

**6. Don't Overlook the Risk Section.**

Companies do not like to talk about why they might lose money, which is what makes this section so compelling. Companies spell out the commercial challenges they face, and also present convincing arguments as to why they might overcome them.

**7. How does it make money?**

Read the business model section. A business model is how a company makes money. A strategy is how it plans to make more. To be credible, strategies must make sense, and they must be reflected in the results of the company.

**8. Skip the Chairman Notes**

Read the CFO notes. The chief financial officer will often repeat what the chief executive and chairman say but add more commentary on the numbers and how they were derived.

**9. Check Accounting Treatments**

Auditor’s report

Auditors very rarely qualify their opinion on the financial statements, but it can be useful to note which areas of accounting they focused their investigation on.

If you enjoyed this then maybe I can tempt you with my Twitter page [/\_JosephWilks](https://twitter.com/_JosephWilks) where I write daily insights on long-term investing like this.",['TWTR']
n7l183,gxdnukg,StockMarket,comment,1620475142,"To build on this, Footnote 1 will typically disclose significant accounting policies, so how the company treats and disclose different areas of the business. Its light on the numbers, but packed with high level info.

FiHi (financial highlights), is also always a good one to look at. The auditors always put a lot of effort into this section to ensure it’s complete and accurate. Some more good quick hitting info on a per share basis in this section.

The other footnotes I’ll read moreso on an as needed basis. If a number looks high or odd in one of the actual financial statements, I’ll try to look toward the corresponding footnote, or sub events footnote to try to figure out what is driving the activity.

CPA here who has only worked in audit, so I probably view the annual and quarterly reports from a different lense.",

If all is accurate this is what I found.

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They   just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led   by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of   his own money
3. Completed   the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the   company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

But I saw lots of buy recommendations. I bought, like, what the heck, we will try it. They keep posting good earnings. Somebody just increased the buy price rating.

But they are also my biggest loser so far. Apparently I did time the peak perfectly by buying at $216. Looks like $160 right now.

Opinions:. Bear or bull? Hold or sell? Should have set a limit to sell before this?  

Note: this isn't a major position for me, realistically i could hold or sell, but I don't think I want to buy more just yet.

It seems these days, even after beating expectations, stocks plummet. How long has the adage ""buy the rumor sell the news"" been relevant? And if it's always been relevant, when did it become almost 100% reliable? (See: Doge SNL).

Were stocks of the 1980s and 90s like this, or this a function of the internet and information accessibility? Data aficionados and real studies/proof/examples appreciated.

n8mfde,gxjf7dg,StockMarket,comment,1620595307,"There are targets.

There are expectations.

And then there are speculations.

Targets are usually almost always hit, especially since they can get adjusted at any time. Expectations are more of a 50/50. And speculations are maybe hit 1/10 or even 1/50 times. See those posts that tell you the stock will go 10x in 2 months? Yea, those are speculations some people believe, but now put it on earnings instead. Especially with Covid this happened a couple of times because not everyone was able to properly predict a huge increase in sales or similar of certain companies and they fully blew up. 

The more solid the state of a market is, the less impact has ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"". The more its shaken up, the more extreme it gets. And DOGE is not only a perfect example because of how shaken up the market is right now, with commodities and crypto taking a huge swing at the stocks, but that it is a pure profit play. There is no value in Doge as a coin and no future outlook as of now, so such a huge reaction should have been predictable - note that I am not saying that the sell off should have been predictable, while it was very likely it could have also went the other direction and now sit at beyond 1$. I'm actually more surprised that it didn't happen before SNL started to not take a risk. And speaking about Doge hitting 1$, if that ever happens this might be another point where it takes an enomours hit, talking up to 50% in a day or over several days. Milestones like these cause an insane reaction, if you traded a lot of penny stocks you know that more than well. And the milestone of 1$ was hyped up a ton to be reached.",

n859xm,gxgl6at,StockMarket,comment,1620531290,"First thing is to pay off any high-interest debt (more than say 4-5%). Then, have an emergency fund of around 3-6 months of expenses.

After those two things are secure, I’d start investing. Until you know how everything truly works, I’d just go with a S&P 500 index fund like VOO or SWPPX. It tracks the companies in the S&P 500. Historically it returns around 9% annually over time.

The reason to have the debt paid off and emergency fund is because investing is long-term. If the market drops temporarily, you won’t want to have to take your money out to pay for rent or something.

You can go on something like Robinhood, where you can play around relatively cheaply. (A lot of people here hate Robinhood for some shenanigans, but hey, if you're new, it's a good way to make some trades without paying really heavy fees. There's some cleverly hidden costs, but no large fees.) It doesn't really matter. Use a broker you're comfy with. It sounds like you're being smart by asking questions, starting light and low risk and being willing to learn. There are plenty of resources online. Find one you trust and just plan on spending time reading. There's a good book called ""One Up On Wallstreet"" by Peter Lynch that I think provides good insight for individual investors.

New appointed BOD member Chuck Hastings, CEO of Riley Wealth Mgmnt (Nasdaq: RILY). More major news imminent! PPS up @100% since first DD. Significant upside remains!  

Ive been super busy and haven’t chance to provide this update…

**Updated EBITDA 2021 estimate with ETH at $3500 is $55,160,000. Current Market cap is $16,384,786.**

My first extensive DD post for APLD (PPS $.92-$1.40, ETH @ $2200) link below. Current PPS approx. $1.80

APLD is a sole Ethereum Mining company. Here’s a quick recap…

&#x200B;

* Creates pure play publicly traded Ethereum mining company
* Strategic Partnership with SparkPool (the largest Ethereum mining pool in the world) and GMR will enable APLD to scale quickly with industry leading efficiency
* SparkPool and GMR each take a  9.9% equity stake in APLD and have executed a three-year services agreement with one year auto renewals
* Strong institutional backing with $16.5 million private placement
* Expects initial mining capacity to come online in May 2021
* Goal is to scale mining quickly and then expand into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-fungible tokens      (NFTs)
* The Company plans to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market as soon as possible

Link to my first DD post…

[DD: OTC MicroCap Gem. Low Float.New ETH Miner trading near/at 1x 2021 EBITDA. New Partnerships & SRVC Agreement w/Sparkpool and GMR. PPS Run just getting started...Applied Blockchain (APLD). : SpecStocks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecStocks/comments/my87ps/dd_otc_microcap_gem_low_floatnew_eth_miner/)

Since my first post, the price of Ethereum has increased to $3500-$3750 from $2300ish, significantly changing the forecasted Revenue/EBITDA for 2021 and beyond (see below). This is keeping APLD a great value despite the 100% increase in PPS since my first post. IMO, ETH bull run has just gotten started. Ethereum network is the foundation for block chain. 

This is stock is still so under the radar!! But IMO that’s very close to changing. Here’s why…

1.PR is due out any day regarding the receipt and installation of their first $5m worth of mining rigs. This news will have significantly positive effect on their PPS. It will eliminate any doubts to going live with their mining rigs, etc. With the low float and typically low volume its best to buy before the news comes out.

2.APLD appointed Chuck Hastings to their board of directors. Chuck Hastings currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of B. Riley Wealth Management, a subsidiary of B. Riley Financial (Nasdaq: RILY).

“Chuck is a recognized leader in the financial industry with more than two decades of global financial and business expertise that will be of tremendous value as we pursue opportunities to leverage our initial investment and further scale our mining operations""

The company's major business segments include aerial work platforms, construction, cranes, material handling & port solutions and materials processing.

They provide literally any equipment you’d need on a construction site.

No matter what data you’re looking at in the past year. They’ve not taken a lose once. No one can say when this winning streak will come to an end. However with the demand for construction sky rocketing. One can only speculate, it won’t be anytime soon. This is largely due to COVID restrictions being lifted as well as Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Now let’s focus a little on the infrastructure bill aspect. There’s a lot of speculation which companies will benefit the most from this. Though trying to pinpoint who’ll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let’s focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains. They’re gonna need a lot of supplies for the job. That’s where TEX the glorious Terex shines.

n7nbg3,,StockMarket,post,1620473509,"Bull Call Spread Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m continuing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Bull Call Spread option strategy

A Bull Call spread is a bullish strategy that is set up by buying a call option of a lower strike price while simultaneously selling a call option of a higher strike price, both being in the same expiration cycle. Take a look at the example below to see how a bull call spread looks like.

 Stock AAA is trading for $45

* Jan 18/21 Long 50 call – $1.50
* Jan 18/21 Short 53 call- $0.60

This comes out to a Net Debit of $0.90. Net debit is the total difference between what you pay and what you receive for all options in a strategy. Since a Call Debit Spread consists of 2 options, the net debit is just the difference between the premium of the long call and short call. These 2 things Net debit and Net Credit are crucial to understand as you will come across these terms frequently. 
 
For premium buying strategies, the net debit will be equivalent to max loss, the maximum amount you can lose from this trade. Meanwhile, Your maximum profit is the width of the strikes of the spread (53-50), minus the net debit. 
3-0.90= 2.10/$210. This will be the maximum amount you stand to make from this trade.

**Max profit** 

As long as the stock trades at or above the short call strike (53) at expiration, max profit is attained.  

**Max loss**

As long as the stock trades at or below the long call at expiration which is 50 in this case, you will lose the net debit paid/max loss which is $0.90 in this case

**Breakeven**

The breakeven point is found by taking the long call + net debit. If the stock trades at breakeven point at expiration, you will breakeven. If at expiration, the stock trades anywhere above the long call’s strike and below the breakeven point, you will lose money, however such losses will be lesser than max loss. If the stock trades anywhere above breakeven point but below the short call strike, you will make money. However, such profits will be lesser than max profit. 

Max profit zone: $53 and above
Max loss zone : $50 and below
Breakeven point: $50.90
Profit zone (not max profit):$50.91-$52.99
Loss zone (not max loss): $50.01-$50.89

If you are looking for more liquid positions maybe consider dividend investing where corporations will give you earnings per share that you can either pocket or reinvest. Analysis is the biggest part though. If you do not understand technical and fundamental analysis you will not be able to enter positions with a strategy (ie entry, exit,  holding period etc) which will also affect your performance when determining the fair market value for ETFs.

n7lewa,,StockMarket,post,1620465567,"Airtel Africa (AAF) analysis and intrinsic value calculationhttps://youtu.be/9fccqZosb1k

Hello investors!

As requested, I have done a deep dive analysis into Airtel Africa, discussing both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business. This is a company that has been on my watchlist for some time, but I’ve only now got round to analysing the business in depth. 

The link to the video is above, but in summary: 

Overview:
AAF is a UK listed telecommunications company operating in 14 countries in Africa. As of September 2020, it had 116 million subscribers to its services and is growing fast. 

Risks:
Poor balance sheet - As at the most recent quarter, AAF had a current ratio of 0.6, meaning they don’t have enough current assets to cover their current liabilities, thus increasing the likelihood of raising addition capital. 

Currency risk - AAF earn their revenues and receive their cash in various African currencies, meaning depreciation in these currencies against the US dollar (their reporting currency) will negatively impact results. 

COVID-19 impact - Many African countries don’t have significant access to vaccines, meaning COVID can continue to cause problems in the short to mid term future. 

Opportunities: 
Huge total accessible market - AAF currently only operate in 14 out of 54 African countries. The logical path for growth is expansion into more countries. 

Fast growing market - Sub-Saharan Africa have the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world, forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%.

Intrinsic value calculation: 
To determine intrinsic value, I’ve used a discounted cash flow model and 10 year earnings multiple approach. Considering how conservative I’ve been with my growth numbers, the outcome is compelling. 

As always, I appreciate any time taken to read the post and watch the video. The purpose of this is to create discourse and provide a fair, balanced view from a variety of perspectives.",

Instead of accepting the gains, I decided to keep trading (greed) when I lost some of my gains. I kept chasing and chasing, until finally I wiped out my gains and lost some of my liquid capital. I know its pretty straight forward “stop trading”. But is there anything any of you do to prevent yourself from doing what I did today? Any help would be appreciated. Cheers!",
n7hu3p,gxd01uq,StockMarket,comment,1620453121,"Sounds like you don't have an exit strategy.  Recommend when you open a new position have a concrete plan as to when and how you will close that position, and stick to it. The personal challenge won't be ""can I squeeze as much as possible out of this play"", but rather ""can I stick to my exit strategy without wavering"".  If you can do this consistently, you will be able to develop and improve upon how you determine exit strategies and minimize gambling losses while maximizing investing gains. 

Make a plan before you buy, and stick to it no matter what.

Friend",
n93pfz,,wallstreetbets,post,1620651128,"Nokia: A Detailed Review of the CompanyI have been bullish on Nokia for a long time. I am betting on Pekka Lundmark and his blueprint to success on Nokia's comeback from the early 5G fiasco. 

It hasn't been a year since his appointment as Nokia's CEO however he has already made very bald moves. He changed the high level leaders within the organization. He changed the approach to 5G, going from an end to end strategy to customer specific approach. Basically, saying if we are not making money on any segment of our business, we won't sign unprofitable contracts just to support the ""greater good"". His goal is to be the technology leader where-ever Nokia is competing. He has no intention of being the low cost provider as his goal is consistent high profitability via technological leadership. That is the right approach. Therefore, he is increasing the R&D spending significantly. More on that later.

He also trimmed the Nokia leadership team from 17 leaders to 11. Maybe the most important move he has made was giving not only full accountability to division leaders, meaning they did not have to consult 10 plus people when they wanted to make a decision regarding their divisions, he also gave them full responsibility. Now, division leaders have the full power AND the full responsibility. The reason why this is very critical is very simple. With this approach, he eliminated internal wars regarding profitability and accountability. Some division leaders-rightfully or wrongfully- hid under the excuse of signing contracts for the ""greater good"" of the company. Plus, Nokia's group common and other ""division"" which is the corporate support division of Nokia had way too many people. The reason for this for me is simple. Some divisions were offloading expenses to look profitable. It made no difference to the company as a whole, it just made them and their bonuses much better. Now, Pekka moved over 10k employees from Group Common out to the divisions they really belong to. 

So, the blueprint is there. What about the execution? Since Pekka Lundmark has been at Nokia, Nokia performed really well in the earnings reports. His guidance has been on the conservative side. He promised the investors and share holders full transparency and he held that promise... Sometimes to the point of annoying the share holders as the stock plummeted after a great earnings report last year when he said the famous words, ""next year will be challenging"". If he perhaps chose better wording, Nokia would have went up 15% instead of plummeting. I feel that the newest hire in Nokia, Melissa Schoeb who is the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer will help with some of this and since her hiring whether related or not, Q1 earnings call had a much different vibe to it than the previous calls. Pekka Lundmark looked a lot more positive than before and I don't think it was only due to the great results. Anyways...

Let's take a look at the first quarter of the challenging  year:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zdagi6t4ay61.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84e604efa4435bcdf9d5ff06a0532670269a321

EPS expectations were 0.01 Euros per share btw. Basically, Nokia killed it with a caveat. Regional and product mixes were favorable as well as the SG&A and R&D spendings were lower than expected. These will balance out in the upcoming quarters and therefore seasonality will not be as high as previous years. The exact effect is unknown however the Q1 earnings are so good that I don't see a way where full year results will be within the lower or even mid range of the guidance. I believe Nokia will beat even it's high end guidance easily. Moreover, I believe the OM improvement for MN to 5-8% will happen in 2022 instead of 2023. There is just no way for this year to be negative and next year to be stagnant if you look at the numbers and listen to each division leader during conference calls or more importantly during the last capital markets day presentation.

Let's take a look at the guidance:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fx1bau9x5ay61.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8ad5e3b6593f19a02dd541d3299845b9b9603b

In Q1 2021:

Mobile Networks had 3.4% OM

Network Infrastructure had 10.8% OM

Cloud and Network Services had -3% OM (this was due to unprofitable contracts signed in the past but these will balance out in upcoming quarters and per the team Nokia will reach it's guidance for 2021)

Nokia technologies had 78.4% OM. 

Basically, in its historically weakest quarter, Nokia had extremely good results. 

Post Q1 Earnings:

I expect Network Infrastructure to go full steam ahead as Nokia signed strong contracts in the US. There is no indication or a reason for it to slow down. 

[https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/tmobile-expands-home-internet-to-more-than-130-additional-cities-towns](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/tmobile-expands-home-internet-to-more-than-130-additional-cities-towns)

Also, Nokia's full year 2021 revenue estimate is between 20.6 billion Euros to 21.8 billion Euros.

That was with the estimation of Networks Infrastructure having around 7 billion Euros in revenues. However, NI is doing excellently and it was the highlight of the Q1 earnings report. Not only because NI is on a trajectory to earn 2 billion Euros more than expected in full year 2021 but because NI has 9%-10% OMs. Therefore, the additional revenue/profit will hit the EPS stronger than say the CaNS division.

Here is how well the NI is doing: (You can also see the strong seasonality in Mobile Networks division in the chart below)

&#x200B;

Here you can see the favorable regional mix. North America and Europe has better margins than anywhere else:

Enterprise Market:

This one is extremely important. Per Pekka Lundmark Nokia is a leader in the Enterprise market. This is very important not because it is a new-ish market and a additional revenue opportunity but because the growth and the profitability is very high. This market is expected to grow in double digits in the next 5 or so years.

Currently, Enterprise market is somewhat small with around the size of 10% of the CSP market, however that will change within 3-5 years. By, 2025 Enterprise market will at absolute minimum be around 3.5 billion Euros with double digit operating margins. If that happens, and the whole industry is saying it is already happening, Nokia's share price will get to $20 much earlier than expected.

Ericsson's share price is $13.90 with a market cap of about $46 billion

Nokia's share price is $5.10 with a market cap of about $29 billion

Does that make sense to anyone? If you think now Nokia is managed properly, how can you value these two companies in this laughable manner? 

However, for the value investors, this is where the value of Nokia lies. It is heavily undervalued and is trading like bankruptcy is an option where as this company has solid cash reserves at over 3 billion Euros and positive cash flows going forwards with no chance of bankruptcy whatsoever.

Let's talk about potential:

Ericsson has 138 Commercial 5G agreements, 81 5G contracts and 85 live 5G networks

[https://www.ericsson.com/en/5g/contracts](https://www.ericsson.com/en/5g/contracts)

Nokia has 220+ Commercial 5G agreements, 165 Commercial 5G deals and 65 live 5G networks

[https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

For those that claim Nokia is winning all these contracts that are unprofitable or Nokia is cost cutting Ericsson to win contracts, you are wrong: please watch the CMD presentation and pay attention to Tommi Uitto's section. Spoiler, Nokia is not offering low margins to win contracts. They haven't needed to cut costs to CSPs to win contracts. Therefore, the potential is absolutely there. 

I was somewhat taken back by the CMD presentation when Nokia skipped 2022 guidance and instead gave 2023 guidance. I suspected things would get worse before they got better. However, looking at the Q1 earnings report, so many things are going well for Nokia that I don't see how things will take a turn for the worse.

Sure, the usual seasonality will not happen at the degree it usually does but that doesn't mean Networks Infrastructure will slow down and Mobile Networks will plummet to negative margins. R&D and SG&A expenses will go up, per Marc Wiren, Nokia will accumulate some inventory in the upcoming quarters that they skipped on in Q1 and these things will smooth the curve however they will not cause Nokia to deviate from it's guidance. 

Therefore, I am much more bullish than ever before. Especially, hearing how well Nokia is managed in avoiding the chip shortage. 

Nokia currently should be around $6-7 range. Conservatively, I expect within 1 year Nokia to reach $9-12. Within 2-4 years $20 or more is possible due to strong foothold in the highly profitably and high growth Enterprise market and the strong performance in the US and Europe markets partly thanks to the Huawei situation.",['NI']

Then u/soggit took [over WSB with his deep dive into $INO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n70cim/my_first_dd_im_a_doctor_and_i_think_ino_is_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

This upcoming week Inovio has a trifecta of positive catalysts that will potentially raise share price to $15-$17. From Fridays close this is a 2.5x gain on commons shares and probably 10-20x gain on call options.

The trifecta of bullish catalysts include:

1. [Completion of their Covid-19 phase II trial ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256652v1)with excellent immune response. The INO-4800 vaccine does not require refrigeration, cheap to manufacture, and will be the number one vaccine for the 95% of the globe’s population that is yet to be vaccinated. Last month India was wrecked. Next week I suspect Nepal, Pakistan. The infection will probably circle back to China in the near future. They are racing against time for  a safe, effective vaccine that can go into the rural hinterland. INO-4800 DNA vaccine is the answer.  (Market size $2.5 Billion)
2. Joint Patent with [Regeneron ($REGN) for their GBM drug/therapeutic.](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=523&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&s1=%22*%22&p=11&OS=) (Market size $400 million)
3. Success of their [phase III HPV Immunotherapy therapeutic VGX-3100](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-announces-positive-results-from-reveal-1-a-phase-3-pivotal-trial-evaluating-vgx-3100-its-dna-based-hpv-immunotherapy-for-the-treatment-of-high-grade-precancerous-cervical-dysplasia-caused-by-hpv-16-andor-hpv-18-301237793.html)  (Market size $1.2 Billion)

**Bear Thesis**

1.25-30% short interest. Citadel of $GME fame has made over $100 million in profits in shorting $INO in 2021. Inovio doing well means bad news for Citadel and hopefully increase the upward pressure on $GME>

2.No product ever successfully commercialized. But remember this was the case for Moderna for their $MRNA vaccine. I suspect $INO is the Moderna of 2021 in terms of DNA vaccine.

3. There is [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ino) which is driving the stock down which is very typical of late stage biotech.

n8mv7h,,wallstreetbets,post,1620592387,"I'm buying WY and so should you.Have you ever wanted to invest an an asset where it's *not* already priced in? **Wyoming**.

Wyoming is comprised of just under 65MM acres, with an average price of $600/acre. That works out to a market cap of approximately $45B, *but* you don't even need to purchase the entire state, or even half of it to own it outright. The Federal Government already owns 48.19% of the land in Wyoming in one form or another, and they have little to no interest in its internal affairs. That reduces the total capital necessary to own all *available* land to only $22B. Now consider that an additional 3MM acres are Indian Reservations (which are their own entities, legally) and you can reduce the price by another $2BB, leaving us with a sticker price of $20B to own the entire state of Wyoming. With 10MM ~~apes~~ jackalopes, that works out to just $2,000 per jackalope (or $1,000 if we just want to take a controlling interest) and we can have our own WSB Polity.

This is a great opportunity for us as ground floor investors. WY has no personal or corporate income taxes and some of the lowest property tax rates in the country. Combine that with one of the lowest costs of living as well. If we purchase the state and live there as well (paying minimal rent to a newly formed REIT, which we can get back in the form of dividends) it's basically living for free, eat your heart out FIREtards. Your FD budget just grew in size by your current rent payment, or spend the savings on that pair of Grand Tetons you've always wanted to help with your gender dysphoria. You're welcome. 

Given that Wyoming has a GDP of $35B, it has gross revenues 75% *greater* than its equity value. Currently the state is only able to capitalize on $2B of that via taxation, but I have a better idea. Using TSLA's *minimum* P/E for the last few years of 550 as a benchmark, we get a price target of nearly $20T or over $1MM per acre. -an order of magnitude greater than pitiful little companies like AAPL, who have a market cap of a measly $2T. If we take shares of WY public I estimate we could *easily* see an ROI of 500x. Asset classes can be based on the primary use of the land. Common shares can be rangeland, the least valuable, with arable farmland comprising A and B classes (irrigated and non-irrigated, respectively), and residential/commercially zoned acreage making up preferred shares.

But, aren't there already people heavily invested in Wyoming? Well, the current population isn't even 600,000 people, so we already outnumber them over 15:1, and that's not taking into account that statistically speaking, *some of us are already in the trade*. If we're quick about it, the level of buying pressure we would generate can only be good for us, since Real Estate takes more time to respond changes in demand. Shortly after we snap up the available land *it will have substantially appreciated in value due to market forces alone*.

In conclusion, buy WY. The state. Buy it all. It's cheap AF, but if all 10MM of us work together we can squeeze the shit out of it, have a 500 bagger, and set up shop in a place where we'll never have to worry about the cost of reloading our accounts again!

$TSLA is now scaling. It took 168 days to build 🇨🇳 Gigafactory. Berlin and TX soon and then India and then https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/elon-musk-opened-tesla-s-shanghai-gigafactory-in-just-168-days

$TSLA ⬆️ 52.92% last 6 months; ⬆️ 310.09% last year; ⬆️ 1,581.61% past 5 years.

There is much more.

$TSLA is basically an Index fund of EV, solar, AI, data, batteries, and more. $GM might be able to produce EV Hummer in 2023 for $110K+. $F just created a battery division and location. 

$TSLA is literally 10 years ahead of the competition. I will be placing an order for a Model Y Long Range this summer. 

Long over 100+ shares, Jan 2023 $500 LEAPS, $800 5/21 CCs, and a $540 July CSP.

NOK got caught up in the GME saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who don’t understand how a Short Squeeze works, and how GME went parabolic in one week. Let's keep in mind, there were some good and truthful DD posts on NOK in December/January, and some great fucking DD on Nok in the last couple months. I suspect it went from $4 to $9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts, trying to find an affordable seat on the Rocketship. No, Nokia doesn't have a ton of short interest. But I still really like the stock and I’d like to tell you why, and a little bit about our future re: John Titor

\>Let's not forget about when this wasn't ALL about fucking the shorts, jeezus christ.. NOK is different from that bullshit, because it truly has deep fucking value. And believe me, this goes DEEP.. They don't manufacture or sell phones anymore. The only connection they have in making and selling phones is the Nokia brand name being licensed out to a Taiwanese manufacturing company called HDM Global. Almost all the company's revenue comes from Wireless Network Infrastructure and Internet Routing Equipment. Let's go back and track this evolution --> In 2010 this only generated 30% of its revenue (Networking Products, Cellular Base Stations, etc) -- In 2020 this made them 85% of their revenue!! Nokia transformed itself into Wireless Technology Company you fucking retards!! They did this through a series of Autistic Acquisitions ""AA"" -- In April of 2011 they acquired the Wireless Network Infrastructure Assets of Motorola Solutions (this basically gave Nokia all of Motorola's 2G 3G 4G assets) --> In August of 2013 Nokia acquired Nokia/Siemens Network joint venture and renamed the division ""Nokia Networks"" and that same year Nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to Microsoft --> The in early 2016, Nokia agreed to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for $15.6 Billion which gave then all of their Wireless Technology, Routers, Switches, and Optical Tech within Alcatel as well as Bell Labs (formerly an Alcatel-Lucent division) -- This final deal gave Nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like Ericsson and Huawei head to fucking head (yeah.. this is real you idiots) And we know that Huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo... So where am I going with this, and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future?? \*\*REEFSHARK - AI DRIVEN 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS - NETWORK SLICING - AND THE POWER OF THE FUTURE\*\* Take an extra retard pill for the rest of this DD post, you're gonna need it. They have been building themselves up to this moment. ReefShark is the key here, 5G Network is the door, and AI Driven 5G Network Slicing is the living room of the future. Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available. It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50%-%60 reduction in energy use, which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth. It is the most efficient chip of its kind, by far, with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance. This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network. They will go through MVNO (MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR) to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud. This is called \*Network Slicing\* for all u chimps out there. For example, Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth. More than 1,000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet. Here is how Nokia fits into all of this techy garbage: NOK IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THIS MARKET SPACE (they made up $4.5 billion of the $66.9 billion of ""Telecom Software and Services"" in 2019) AND \*REEFSHARK\* MAKES THEM THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER IN THIS EVERGROWING MARKET WITH AI POWERED NETWORK CAPABILITIES<

\*\*\*BONUS LEVEL\*\*\* Last year NASA selected Nokia's Bell Labs division to supply the 4G LTE communications network for the moon soon. No joke, the ACTUAL Moon, not emoji moon. Before the end of 2022, they will put a highly functioning 4G network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the Moon. Drop the crayons for a second and think about this... Ok now eat the red one (it's the same colors as your wife's butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck) Your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4G talk is about with all the 5G shit rolling out nationwide, changing the course of history... Answer--> the lunar surface is relatively flat so there won't be interference with the cheaper, more practical 4G network. We are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu. The signal will travel further, it just makes more sense. They must start somewhere, though this will evolve into 5G up there eventually. \*\*NASA could've given this contract to anyone, but THEY CHOSE NOKIA because they believe in them!!

Ok.

1. MVIS short interest was at 20% when that shit blew up to $28. What's FINRA showing us?

&#x200B;

A spicy, spicy 29%. Gee I wonder why it tanked instead of going to the 60-90 range?

2. Extremely bullish options chain set up.

Unless all of these calls running from 15 to 20 are all WSB, the people that bought these aren't in the business of losing money. There's only 2 weeks until all of these expire, and going from 14 to 20 is no small feat.

3. Elliot Wave mumbo jumbo lookin' good, apparently.

&#x200B;

[lines on a graph](https://preview.redd.it/922a5j25c9y61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc9a084cbb32b0247b14f8c9a1694cfe8dbac2e)

&#x200B;

[yup those are some lines right there.](https://preview.redd.it/hbt0rm17c9y61.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e65e5b5c23328a5f8622bb34dc627f5796144b)

The Elliot wizards say the next run up will is looking to be soon, and could go to 18 this week and 28 before the 21st. Can I back this up? No fuckin' clue. The info is out there, and it confirms my bias, so I put it in here. The wizards say that the price may likely (or hopefully) hit 12, as whenever MVIS hits the triple bottom support line it likes to rip the fuck up like nobody's business.

4. Other indicators show signs of a run up soon.

&#x200B;

[On the 4 hour, Stoch RSI, RSI, and MACD are on their way up.](https://preview.redd.it/o25pc1l7f9y61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fda48bf05e1517d24e26318881527dadd19c353)

Also, Mr. Fibonacci says that the next resistance point upward from 14.27 is between 16.93 (38.2% retracement of the 4 and 13 week low) and 17.51 (38.2% retracement of the 52 week high).

5. No earnings report. Apparently any sort of earnings report will tank a stock shorted or owned by citadel, regardless of how good or bad it is just to put us 'retailers' in our place(example- AAPL). But good news! I heard that several darkpools have been closed, so no more or less of the ""buy from the darkpool and sell on the open market to only impact the price negatively"" tactics. Is that what a short ladder attack is? IDK. Seems like Citadel can just nakedly short whatever the hell they want without repercussions anyway, so take with grain of salt.

Anyway, I don't pretend to fully understand all this shit, so it probably has more holes and a weaker foundation than a jenga tower ready to fall. Disclaimer- I have 40 19c's expiring on the 21st, so I need the hopium more than all of you.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings))

n8f30j,,wallstreetbets,post,1620569783,"Got losses. No worries, it's just a tax write off.Remember that the system was made to benefit the market. If you are an American Tax Payer. Capital Gains tax can be something you are worried about. But you also have Capital Loss Dedications. If you are married and filing jointly or Single (like most retail investors are), you can claim 3k deduction. For married but filing separately folks, it's 1.5k. Best part about the system, losses carry over till the amount is fully used as a deduction (15k loss in a year translates to 5 years worth of 3k deductions). 

Example. If I lost 15k on my plays before the end of the taxable year (December 31st 2020) and I'm married filing jointly. I can get a 3k deduction from my taxable income or capital gains for my 2020 taxes. This then drops my capital loss down ammount to 12k. Next year for my 2021 taxes, I can use another 3k deduction from the 2020 losses to drop my taxable income. This again drops my capital loss from 2020 to 9k. You can continue to do this till that capital loss amount hits zero. 

Key point, no matter how much you gained in a year in trading, it doesn't just make your capital losses just disappear. Even if I gained in 2021, I can still use the 2020 capital losses to offset all taxable income sources. So make sure you claim those losses WSB. You didn't lose trading, you simply made it so your taxable income is offset in the years to follow.

Edit: Just to clarify. It has to a be a total lose at the end of the tax year. This means that after gains and losses. You have to lose money. This can only be calculated on closed out positions. Holding assets if they depreciate in value, doesn't mean it is considered a loss. ""It's only a loss if you sell"".

Edit 2: Someone brought up Gains. If I lost money one year but gained money the next. My 3k deduction gets applied to the Capital Gains tax first. If I lost 15k in 2019 but made 15k in 2020. My 2020 gains will be taxed as making 12k. Now if I  made only 2k in 2020. I don't pay taxes on that 2k and that 1k left over goes to my taxable income. Consecutive year losses doesn't just make it compound either. It just make a different deduction pot later down the road.

Edit 3: Something I forgot to mention but another poster did. Losses on wash sales don't apply. Look up Wash Sales if you don't know what it is.

Edit 4: I attempted to make it clear but failed to do so. The Capital Loss is a deduction, not a credit. This means that it isn't exactly a 1-1 solution. What I was trying to convey is that a Capital Loss can lower your taxable income. This doesn't means that you will get 3k back in  a return but that you taxable income is reduced by 3k. So if you are in the upper limit of a tax bracket, that 3k offset to taxable income may mean little. But if you are in the lower end of a tax bracket, that 3k may be able to put you down another bracket so you can qualify for other deductions or credits.

But not so fast! The market realities from last time still [stand strong](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n48yea/corn_ethanol_demand_lack_of_supply_odd_weather/). **But it might be time to take some profits.** 

*Remember for all soft commodities (ag, lumber) we're faced with a major supply/demand imbalance. Once this calms down and find an equilibrium, we are definitely going down. Maybe not to $2-3/bsh, but $4 is a real reality. If you're trading futures, you are probably already experienced in this. Just when the supply/demand imbalance is still in play, these commods can go much higher.* 

*For the new people on* r/wsb*: this does not mean diamond hands. There is no such thing as diamond hands in agricultural commodities (or industrial metals for that matter). You will be dragged off the floor once you get margin called, or when the supply/demand finds an equilibrium.* 

**Weather is improving**: As of right now, the link for the drought forecast is dead (blame the SEC, CFTC or regulators to prevent the price from going up?). But overall, we might be getting peak drought for the midwest and plains. Better weather is coming, with rains expected next weekend.

**Replanting and additional acreage**: One of the main reasons that lit the corn rocket was the [weak first quarter planting report](https://www.andersonsgrain.com/market-commentary/market-videos/usda-report/2021/mar-31/). That was when front month corn was in the mid $5s. $2 later, I'm hearing a lot of farmers trying to get more land to grow because $7 corn does not come often. The price boost is enough for them to take advantage. 

**USDA Data**: [Lots of data](https://www.usda.gov/media/agency-reports) for the new month are coming in this week. I've underlined the important ones for corn below. Prices will be volatile during this time. If the crop progress causes a drop in the price, I will probably start selling corn into the last half of the week.

**My corn**: Finally as a good sign, some of my corn are getting ears! We've gotten some good rains during the last week in South Texas. So now the hope is that no bad weather comes between now and September (or if bad weather does come, I'll be loading up on long futures again).

TLDR:  Colonial Pipeline hit with ransomware attack, on 7 May, and still down.  Gas Prices expected to take off.   Primary owners split between private and public companies with KKR and Royal Dutch Shell (Ticker: RDS) having the most exposure.   Gasoline is a Just In Time (JIT) commodity so if this isn't resolved by tomorrow, Futures expected to be impacted.

You can see what some firms are charging to spread negative info. in places like WSB. Be warned even after GME and AMC are done as retail trading grows ***more resources*** will be spent trying to influence retail traders one way or the other. 

When money is involved, well you know, love and war baby, Love and war ....

Take everything with a grain of salt. Check the filings ect. to verify. If some info. is non-verified I down grade it in my thinking. I know my  trades! For instance I gave back some of my RKT gains and rolled more hvy into GME and silver, I like the stonk and shinny. RKT is still a solid company and the #'s look good BUT my inflation fears > RKT story atm and at the end of the day, RKT prints paper with few tangible assets.  

To the guy that said he lost everything on RKT earnings telling everyone else to buy shares but he only bought weeklies himself WITH ALL HIS $$$$, BIG Oooffff (never go full retard)

I traded shares only for a few years before I started down the options rabbit hole. Also sirjackalot only trades shares and has gone from like $44k to almost 2 million in a couple of years 💦💦. I say that to highlight if you are new to trading, read books, learn and be careful, wrong moves in the stock market can be life changing one way **OR** the other.

n8ek8d,,wallstreetbets,post,1620567942,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/q29ncm07m3y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e400362006ce7ce4571361731cece094ba3b9d38)

GME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position. 

 **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** 

https://preview.redd.it/sdfgfdncm3y61.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc44dd645aa9f8fdba923805c7013156328d8b70

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. 

**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. 

**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. 

**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. 

**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

n8tgr6,,wallstreetbets,post,1620613249,"“In essence, the stock market represents three separate categories of business.”Take this quote by the original GME OG to heart: “In essence, the stock market represents three separate categories of business. They are, adjusted for inflation, those with shrinking intrinsic value, those with approximately stable intrinsic value, and those with steadily growing intrinsic value. The preference, always, would be to buy a long-term franchise at a substantial discount from growing intrinsic value.”

His fundamental tenets are 1.) Margin of safety is king 2.) look at ev/ebitda 3.) free cash flow. 4.) is it a well established franchise... 

If those hit the Mark... do your own damn research to know what those should be.. do a deep dive into the company and management. Because at the heart of his value investing is this: you don’t look just for value... you look for growth.. is it at a discount from growing intrinsic value that currently the market just isn’t seeing... 

Now if you look across this entire market at the moment, there is only one stock that hits all of this: ViacomCBS, VIAC. Do your DD.. see if it hits those basic metrics, then do the deep dive... for instance take a look at the most recent q1 ER call. 

I really don’t have much else to say. This, for those who know how to look for it, is the current Alpha in this market. It’s a sleeping giant... just do an even basic deep dive... or don’t. Really don’t care. This post probably won’t even make it to being posted!",['VIAC']

n8nalc,,wallstreetbets,post,1620593587,"Mega Move Incoming For WELL Health $WELL $WLYYFOK so after seeing the fundamentals were pretty sound: 

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They   just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led   by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of   his own money
3. Completed   the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the   company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

&#x200B;

I decided to take it one step further and dive into the charts. Canadian company so I'm going with the Canadian ticker ""WELL"" as it seems to get most of the action. 

I like to start my TA by zooming out to the maximum relevant period for any story. This last year given the pandemic seems like the most logical time frame for this... The stock performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic and is now finding itself consolidating in the $7 range. 

Now the key for me is that within this consolidation period the company has made immense progress as I stated above. This is an entirely new story , management was able to use their operational skills and really take advantage of this situation. 

1. They raised an additional $305M led by the 29th richest man in the world who has invested in every single round to date... This one priced at a 25% premium. 
2. They used that capital to acquire CRH Medical which is going to bring revenues to $300M and free cash flow to $50M 
3. They acquired Circle Medical - a leading silicon valley company which is going to allow them to compete with any US Healthcare company. 
4. They are now the first Canadian healthcare company to directly integrate into Iphone. 
5. and still they have 0 debt and what I calculated to almost $80M in cash... 

To put it simply - they are on a hot M&A streak and doing it very very well (no pun intended lol). 

SO this is where it gets interesting for me - If we zoom out a year to the point they last started bolstering up M&A activity around March/April we see WELL is sitting clean on its 200day SMA before making a monster move for the better half of the year. 

Now this is where they stood apart... Unlike other companies who experienced monstrous returns over the year and didn't focus on the operational aspect (Cough cough CLOV) WELL was able to use this time to focus on operations and exponentially increase its revenue, brands, cashflows, and ultimately justify its stock price up here. 

Now here is where the TA comes in... A year ago they were sitting flush on the 200 Day SMA right as they started increasing M&A Activity... Now again, after making hugely successful acquisitions with CRH, Circle, etc while in this consolidation period WELL is again sitting clean on its 200day SMA and has double bottomed with a higher low and  is further shown with the RSI being oversold and coiled in the right direction. .. There is also a massive Bull Flag forming... Further suggesting a huge breakout

[1Year\/Daily \(200day SMA confluences\) ](https://preview.redd.it/rloh016ij5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=b480d9d3d67d44c2c757dd4234ed8803d9072309)

Now obviously one time frame doesn't tell the whole story so I went deeper. 

Right, 6 month/Daily shows the same thing - Massive consolidation - Bull flag - Higher low - and a clean on its 200 day SMA. 

[6Month\/Daily - Higher low - Bull flag - Double bottom.](https://preview.redd.it/wejhg81hn5y61.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=79e205d5e494309bc55812d0a8a74f2210136d02)

10 day/Hourly - WELL Closed on strong volume right below its 50 day SMA - The last time was on 04/23 when it closed just below its 20 day SMA on strong volume and proceeded to move 10% + (Caused by a failed short report). 

[10 days\/Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/bzzwkfayn5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=a81147d55aaa39ab985e6b88a0323d5be4ed0601)

So that led me to look at the volume... Which we see is roughly double the week prior. 

&#x200B;

[Volume Increase 04\/09 - 05\/07 ](https://preview.redd.it/0d1flpjho5y61.png?width=2482&format=png&auto=webp&s=573ba72ecbdc124b99ebddf9f92860e17c6fd40b)

Analysts are expecting record earnings Tuesday so that's more than likely the cause. 

Now that brings me to my final question? Where can this go? 

On a short term we see an inverse H&S and a next resistance at 7.18 (Likely opens above that I think) 

https://preview.redd.it/vffo46n3p5y61.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=256fa9d69a481aacc997a97dd96fe378a0894415

Now this 7.18 level is key to break so the next stop would be 7.80 as we see here (+10%) 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2oktpnxep5y61.png?width=2872&format=png&auto=webp&s=509a680d5f995a9009e64078c057aec47b500404

Once that 7.80 level is reached which I believe earnings will help us achieve then we need to zoom out again and look at where this really could go... The answer to that is obviously subjective based on what happens in the business but I think as they are exponentially increasing the value of their core business via M&A activity the very same thing could happen with the stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/snwojxnzp5y61.png?width=2634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a929096195ed04fb7402f0879c6e964fff8f345

I believe if earnings are positive that WELL could break out of this $7-$9 consolidation zone and find itself trading in a new zone, likely blue skies somewhere in the teens or 20s. 

I really have conviction in this because they just raised $305M priced at a 25% premium to market at the time ($9.80) which the 29th richest man in the world put up $105M of... 

Now the question is to load up before earnings or watch and see what happens but potentially miss out on this move.","['EMR', 'AAPL']"

There is a reference to “equity offerings” as follows in the filing above:  
""In addition, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of either series at any time prior to March 15, 2024 in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of...""

Furthermore, “Equity Offering” is defined in Section 1.01 of the related exhibit below as ""a primary public or private offering after the Issue Date of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Equity Interests) of the Issuer, other than (a) a public offering registered on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or (b) an issuance to any Subsidiary of the Issuer.""

To check if this ""Equity Claw"" provision was used in previous note issues, I searched Pitney's 8-K filings during the past 7 years for similar transactions. I found four but none of them have any mention of “equity offerings” in the main body of the filing:

There must be a reason why the lawyers chose to add this provision in the new financing agreements.

So, what is Pitney Bowes planning to do to potentially pay off some of its debt?  
1. Sell more baby bonds to replace its 6.70% Notes Due 2043 (PBI.PRB) to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.  
2. Spin-off/Carve-out its growing Global Ecommerce business through an IPO.  
3. Issue more of its own common stock.",

n8g0l3,,wallstreetbets,post,1620572635,"Next level DD: CLOV**\*TL;DR at the bottom**

So first let me get some things straight. I’m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here.

&#x200B;

**Chamath** is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC’S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless!

* A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can’t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn’t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn’t see the potentials.

&#x200B;

**Vivek Garipalli** is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which are looked until the price reached $30 for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as a Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners.

&#x200B;

**What is Clover Health?** Well, it’s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: “Clover’s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover’s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients’ wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.”

&#x200B;

* The development of this software is led by Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence.

&#x200B;

* What’s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover’s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy – all at a low cost and on an open network.

&#x200B;

* Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry’s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member’s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover’s members.

**Now to the fun part, the numbers!**

&#x200B;

**Public Float:** 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock – 2M, Baillie Gifford & Co– 5M: They are either mutual fund & long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds.

**Revenue:** In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that’s a YoY growth of \~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better!

**EBITDA** may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc…. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Option Interest on Calls:** 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there’s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares!

&#x200B;

**Short interest:** As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF’s are digging their own graves by doing that!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Total call OI and shorted shares** are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted.

**Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts)** \- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K – 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially.

&#x200B;

\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth

\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 – Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note – if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn’t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts’ price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up.

&#x200B;

**So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs?** Well, there’s a couple of reason why.

&#x200B;

* Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS
* Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI)
* Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report.

&#x200B;

The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There’s some more minor stuff besides this.

The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive.

&#x200B;

**After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV**

&#x200B;

* CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying:

&#x200B;

*“There is no more real person than I am about this shit,” he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a “fucked up” healthcare market during a meandering phone call. “And I don’t care, like, publish whatever. But don’t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.”*

&#x200B;

* This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days!

**Next week,** when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21… can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can!

&#x200B;

**Macro-wise,** NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today’s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon’s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB “short & gamma squeeze” candidate).

&#x200B;

**Bearish case:**

* Increasing competition in the space
* Legacy companies VS CLOV
* From 46% YoY growth to \~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?)
* Potential Nasdaq correction

&#x200B;

**Bonus info:** Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD.

&#x200B;

**Analyst ratings:**

* Citigroup buy with a PT of $19
* Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10
* JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15

So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom.

&#x200B;

**My price predictions**. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. **Please do your own DD before investing**, I’m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice.

For the apes out there 🚀🚀🚀

Fair value estimates included.**Model**: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Verizon Communications., AT&T., and T-mobile US
* Combined this model with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 3 + CHTR, T.TO, and BCE.TO)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust C43 and H43 as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing --> if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it
* Of particular note in the comps spread is Charter Communications options outstanding. They provide a dollar figure, so I worked backwards to arrive at the correct value for Gross proceeds from exercise of options
* Rogers Communications would have been included in the comps analysis, but I felt the pending merger would skew multiples beyond what could realistically be compared with the US big 3. I should probably include Vodafone but I was so excited to share! Maybe if you check back in I'll have added it :)
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I have my own opinions about the intangibles of these companies (management, forward looking results of the recent spectrum auction etc.) but I feel that if people want to chat about those things the comment section would be a better place to do it!
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")

Both IPO and Direct Listed companiesI knew that when I posted that DD on $PLTR CEO heavily selling stocks within six months of going public will be challenged strongly but I had no idea about the intensity. The comment section in that post is just sad and a true reflection of the state of the desperation from so many bag holders. They are trying so hard to defend these heavy selling of $PLTR shares by the CEO by weak and laughable logic. You really want to talk about the insider selling? Let’s see what other CEO of successful company did-

**Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos**

Company went public in 1997

stock price was $1.73 at that time.

Bezos sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003, six years after his company went public.

He sold 2.95M shares at price range $28-$49

He did not sell any shares in 1999 when the stock was trading at its ATH of $107

When he sold his 1st share it was over 2800% up from its IPO price

&#x200B;

**Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates**

Company went public in 1986

stock price was $0.11 at that time.

Gates sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003, seventeen years after his company went public.

He sold 22M shares at price range $25-$26

He did not sell any shares in 1999 when the stock was trading at its ATH of $56

When he sold his 1st share it was over 23000% up from its IPO price

&#x200B;

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk**

Company went public in 2010

stock price was $3.84 at that time.

Musk sold his 1st batch of shares in 2010, the same year his company went public.

He sold only 1.41M shares at $3.4

And then he bought back those 1.41M shares in 2011 at $5.75 (paid more than he got from selling them)

After that in 2012 he purchased

1.87M shares at $1.6

35.3K shares at $5.65

88.9K shares at $2.22

In 2013 he purchased

1.08M shares at $18.44

214K shares at $9.3

Then he kept buying shares in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 at even higher price. In 2020 he even purchased 13K shares at $767

He did not sell any shares even when TSLA was trading at $900

The only other time he sold 2.78M shares in 2016 at $42.6

***Now go and look at what Steve Jobs and other CEOs did, you will be very surprised.***

&#x200B;

**CEOs and insiders of other Direct listing companies**

What about **directly listed stocks?** Let’s see-

**$SPOT:** It has been 3 years they went public. No insiders sold a single share till today except Direct TV sold their shares.

**$WORK:** ~~Almost 2 years since they went public. No insiders sold a single share till today.~~ CEO sold about 1.8M shares at different price. First sold 125K shares on 06/08/2020 at $30-$32 one year after company went public

**$RBLX:** CEO David Baszucki sold only 1.3M shares at 67.77

**$COIN:** ~~No insiders sold a single share till today.~~ CEO has not sold any share yet. (Thanks to u/aahsir for pointing this mistake)

People kept saying Alex Karp did not sell much or he needs to pay tax on the options he has been exercising. He got 141M shares from options with an exercise price of $11.38 and these options will expire on August 20, 2032 that is more than 11 years from today. None of these 141M shares are even vested yet. Only 2.5% (3.525M) shares will be vested in August 2021. Now tell me what is so hurry that he kept exercising those options and selling these shares when these options are not expiring in next 10 years?

You do not pay tax on these options until you exercise them. Even if you exercise them you pay only capital gain tax on the profit you make from the difference between the FMV and exercise price. CEOs do not just exercise their options they get from their stock-based compensation 11 years before the options expires. Even if they do, they do not just sell them immediately when the company is still bleeding money and cash negative. You only exercise these options if you think that there is little to no benefit of keeping these options for long time and you can get more money if you exercise them now, even after paying the tax on it.

Some people are saying Karp only getting 1M in salary. Oh boy! You have no idea why a CEO take cash salary less than 1M and take options and stocks worth billion. Karp is taking only 1M salary, but his total compensation is over 1B. That means he is taking a salary in cash that is less than 0.1% of his total compensation. Do you know why? Because that’s the maximum cap that you can deduct fully from your expenses. If his expense is 3M in 2021, he will basically pay $0 income tax on his cash salary. But if his cash salary was 2M and his expenses were 3M then he can deduct only 1M expense but still need to pay income tax on his rest 1M cash salary.

Now if he thinks that $PLTR will be $50 by let’s say Feb 2022, why would he exercise those options now and sell those stocks at $20? Think more and please let me know.

Some people were saying it’s his stocks and it doesn’t matter what he does with his stock. Seriously? You know, this is why people, both from other finance related subs and we ourselves, call us retards. Sometimes it might seem funny but it’s not.

And please do not say that it's a long term investment because people invest on a stock keeping years timeframe in mind do not spend time discussing their investment strategies here. Even when people post showing gains from stock they are being mocked heavily although I dot agree with that kind of feedback. wsb is anything but a long term investment sub. Now some people do pretend to become one when they are left holding bags on a meme stock like PLTR. All these might sound bitter to you who bought PLTR at $35 or even at $40 but that's the truth.

&#x200B;

**TlDr:** What the CEO of $PLTR has been doing in terms of dumping shares is completely opposite of what other CEOs did in past and it’s a big red alert.

I do like Palantir Technologies as a company and I believe that with careful implementation of good business strategies they might become a very successful tech company. But, I do not like $PLTR stock for many reasons such as heavy insider selling, compensation structure of the company top executives and most importantly due to their direct listing. If you observe the price action of other directly listed tickers such as $SPOT and $WORK you will have an idea.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Based on few comments, looks like **I was probably wrong on the tax implication of the options granted** as part of stock based compensation. I need to read more on that specific topic.

I am still bearish as other CEO did not sell that much stocks that soon that frequently. Tax implication was just one point and I was wrong on that one, I agree. But, **stock options as part of a compensation are not subject to 1 million cap and can be deducted 100% value of those options**. In fact this is one reason CEOs take less salary (subject to 1M cap), less bonuses (subject to 1M cap), less RSUs(subject to 1M cap) and more stock options.","['TSLA', 'MSFT', 'MMM', 'AMZN']"
n8mx95,gxjb2lr,wallstreetbets,comment,1620593298,"Ok, I agree that Karp has sold a lot.

But, a lot of your premise is based upon time of selling from IPO. For a more accurate comparison, you could look at age of the company. For example, Wikipedia says Amazon was founded in 1994, and went public in 1997 - that's three years. Your post states Bezos sold shares six years after it went public, so in total that's 9 years since he founded it. 

Palantir was founded in 2003 and went public in 2020, or 17 years. So he's had to wait a lot longer to sell. 

Not saying you are wrong, but I'd be interested in the results once company age is accounted for. For example, you could look at the proportion of shares Bezos sold up to 2011 - that's 17 years since he founded it.",['AMZN']
n8mx95,gxjj5lr,wallstreetbets,comment,1620597290,"You’re wrong about tax implications. However much you’re granted, when it vests such as RSU’s or options, you have to pay taxes on those even though you plan to keep those shares. I.e. magiKarp gets 100 shares granted and vests on May 1st, and at that current time $20 is the stock price and his effective tax rate is 40%. That means he has to “sell to cover” 40 shares ($800) in order to keep 60 shares ($1200). You can’t forego these taxes as it is considered income like a paycheck where you get taxed when paid out or when it vests. This happens EVERYTIME his SBC gets vested and after 17 years, it probably needs to be spread out over a long period of time; monthly or quarterly based on how much equity he has. 

Alongside this, the majority of salaries for the employees are heavily reliant on stock based compensation (SBC’s). Palantir underpays their engineers and developers In terms of cash but offers significant SBC. In order for the employees to get these, because of DPO, either Karp, Cohen, or thiel has to sell their shares to distribute to the employees. Karp has laid all these out and also on the S-1 filings. He’s been transparent from the beginning and gave insight on how they ran the company. People are just spreading FUD and fail to understand on how all this works.",

It's pretty much UFC (it is the majority owner now and will own 100% of it via a buyout) plus a bunch of miscellaneous companies. Most of these miscellaneous companies are pretty worthless IMO, but I am buying it as a pure play on UFC.

Short-term catalysts: Hot IPO as MMA is really getting popular now, Elon as board-member. Good memestock potential.

Long-term outlook: Pricing is at a slight premium but given the trajectory of sports franchise valuation, it's pretty safe to say that at some point UFC will justify $20B+ even as a value play. Which means that even if it doesn't fly high right now, at some point it should go back up. There's little risk of being left holding a permanent bag.

n8b6gm,,wallstreetbets,post,1620554722,"ALIBABA (BABA)

Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here’s why:

GROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%.

The company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028.

Debt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say.

Alibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view:

1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users.

2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly.

3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the “per-product-cost”.

4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform.

PRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of  20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap.

WHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are 

A) Usa-China relationships

B)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population

—> WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: 

CCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his “diamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent.

CCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the “formula” that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism.

For these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share.

So, with earnings in companies like ACB and SNDL coming up this week, I think it's time to take a look at all of this again. I won't rehash my discussions about supply chains and marketable brands here, because I already talked about that in my last thread.

Instead, I wanna talk about earnings. Historically, a lot of these Canadian weed companies have had some pretty shit earnings, and they're debt has carried at way too high capacities. Here's why I think that's about to change.

Earnings have consistently been improving, especially during pandemic times. Let's face facts, more and more people are starting to like weed. The pandemic put a lot of us in our homes with nothing better to do than to spark up every couple of hours. 2020 generally saw improved earnings for a lot of these companies as people began more actively using marijuana over things like alcohol. Personally, I think this trend is gonna continue. As a former dude who drank way the fuck too much, moving to an American state where weed is legal got me to transition from drinking to smoking or using edibles. While I still drink, it's very rare and I generally use weed because I can wake up the next morning and not feel like someone drove a train into my head. It's also been cheaper in the long run. I used to spend 40 bucks on good whiskey that would last me a week, sometimes a week and a half. Now, I spend 30 bucks on weed that lasts me two weeks. With the news that American legal sales recently hit all-time highs, I think we're going to see this trend continuing as people transition to more regular cannabis use. This increasing trend will only bolster what I mentioned in my last post about supply chains and marketable brands.

Additionally, the Biden Admin is discussing cutting the amount of nicotine allowable in cigarettes in half. I believe that this type of action will trend towards cigarette smokers turning to marijuana instead. While I've not read any direct studies or anything on the matter, I've had three different friends who all used marijuana to help alleviate withdrawals from quitting smoking and then became regular cannabis users. While obviously the submarkets for alcohol and tobacco products will remain plenty strong, the push for American legalization is going to continue to leech consumers from those markets into the cannabis market. Increased social acceptability and turning from other ""sin products"" to marijuana are going to combine with the supply chains and branding advantages Canadian Cannabis already holds to create a power house when America fully legalizes. 

For the above reasons, I'm staying bullish af on companies like ACB, TLRY, etc.

Edit: so this has gotten a little more attention than I ever expected. I only really planned the first of these two posts and this one was more impromptu this morning. That being said, it seems like some of you are actually interested in what my dumbass has to say. I'll probably put something else together when a few of these earnings go through. Obviously, this isn't financial advice and you probably shouldn't listen to my autistic bullshit, but for those interested, I'll keep it up. Now I gotta figure out what I'm gonna name the next one.",

\*\*The model only uses price data and doesn't look at earnings (which is Tuesday), fundamentals, insider selling, etc if you want to go read about how Alex Karp or Peter Thiel sold 275 million. & 500 Million in shares go read another DD

\*\*\*Model uses positive drift because it starts at IPO, price since Feb doesn't look like positive drift

POS: Long 700 Shares, Short 1x Jan '22 27C, 1x Jan '23 30C, 1x Jan '23 35c.

I built a Monte Carlo simulation to help make Palantir Tendies since the stock has been slapped back down to $19/share from its high in January. A look at the stock price since IPO:

[Remembering when those PLTR tendies came so easy...](https://preview.redd.it/599wmdagf1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd1baf4fa2ed08ebf2158eba39c4a14d66740c5)

Looking at the top 20 daily percent change days, we can see since IPO top 20 days where PLTR has gone up have been bigger in magnitude than the top 20 down days. This is good for us holding long positions. 

[Top 20 up days by daily &#37; change](https://preview.redd.it/8mfajlrre1y61.jpg?width=724&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53ae9ac4ae158b5241942b644462ab46ab819385)

For the model, I took daily % change for every trading day since IPO, from there I found average daily percent change (aka drift) and standard deviation of daily percent change( (aka volatility 6.26%). Since the average daily percent change is positive (.67%), we can say PLTR has positive drift (statistical proof that stonks only go up). This was calculated since IPO, meaning it may not be the case in the future.

&#x200B;

From here I took the last closing price ($19.75) and added drift plus/minus a random value equal to some number in between plus/minus 6 standard deviations (assuming a normal distribution.) to find the next day's closing price and continued that until the end of the simulation, Then repeat the simulation 10,000 times.

Here are the outputs:

Since a year is too messy to really get anything useful here is the prediction for the next 60 Days (42 trading days)

[Pick a price between green and red line](https://preview.redd.it/5ufmrp0ai1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c262c5c8be936f36e95edf555e7685a38ab62b91)

The confidence interval refers to how many of the scenarios fell underneath that line (remember this was run 10,000 times). So out of 10,000 Monte Carlo moves, 95% fell below the green line, 5% were below the red line and 50% were below the blue line. Basically, the green line is your faggy-d for a long call, the red line is a cheap hedge for a long put, and the 50% line is the ""most likely"" outcome. Prices are 5%: 12.21, 50%: 24.14, 95%: $46.73  Also the distribution of outcomes:

Does it work??

To see if the Monte Carlo even works I truncated the data in the model by limiting the dates used to predict future price and made it predict the price for days that are already past. I then plotted them vs how the sock actually traded that day. 

[from Mar 21-May 21 stock underperformed model](https://preview.redd.it/yzyzj16ek1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d452f72e47593ce17b574b6b626407f6b1426d56)

From March to May, Pltr stayed with the prediction for about 10/42 trading days then underperformed compared to the predicted price. If you wanted to speculate you could go long looking for a regression to the 50% confidence interval. 

&#x200B;

[From Jan 21 - Mar 21](https://preview.redd.it/11u5zuprk1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=57db219c2000bf3273751a5b4866c56b54ea57ae)

From January to March PLTR followed the 50% line for \~23 days then moved to the 5% line. hedging with long puts around 5% confidence interval would have likely made big tendies.

&#x200B;

[From Nov 20 to Jan 21](https://preview.redd.it/lxkddo0cm1y61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4251559b1db81bd610a7a4d7cc1d83fb591c7f99)

From November 20 to January 21, PLTR traded at or above the 50% confidence interval.

n877f3,,wallstreetbets,post,1620537173,"Palantir (PLTR) Valuation Comparison with its High Growth SaaS PeersI am a data engineer in finance. I am embarking on a new journey to provide data analysis and transparency to retail traders. Stock price, sentiment and news headline can be manipulated by the street, but data is your ""seeing stone"" . Here is my quick notes about Palantir:- I did some analysis (linear regression) on growth SaaS companies. At $20, PLTR is **neither cheap nor overpriced** among peers.

\- The recent week's drop was spread across the high growth SaaS sector. If you see the price drop of SaaS stocks or simply ARKK fund, it is highly correlated to the **sector rotation** on inflation concern.

\- I saw people joking about whenever PLTR signed a deal, its stock dropped. Correlation does not mean causation. PLTR is projected to grow its revenue by 30%+, which is 300M+/y, or on average 25M+/m. To keep this growth, you would naturally expect at least signing two new 10M+ contracts each month. So please **do not get over hyped** when PLTR get a multi-million dollar contract. Think about the overall impact.

\- Despite the recent price drop of PLTR, SI stays at historical low at 2.68% by s3 partners. Total inst. holdings at 30% but the number of holders increased significantly to \~600. I heard that HFs still **wait for earning to confirm** the commercial growth due to recent sector/macro risk

\- Key stock catalyst is next Tuesday's PLTR earning after hour. Keep an close eye a few key metrics, including **profitability timeline**, **Q1 revenue growth** (especially on the commercial side) , **2021 revenue guidance**, **contribution margin** and **stock based compensation (SBC)**

\- My model shows PLTR at **$20 is the fair value** given 30% Rev CAGR & 12% discount rate for 4B'25 goal from mgmt. But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat & raise. There is certainly short term hype & risk. But I am **bullish** with a **2-5y horizon**

\- As of May 9, **130.8M worth of contracts signed** this year with U.S Gov for PLTR

“4 IntroductionSARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, continues to be a major threat to worldwide health and economic productivity. As of April 2021, there have been over 32 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and 575,000 deaths in the United States6. Most infected individuals are either asymptomatic or have mild to moderate disease characterized by symptoms such as cough, fever, and mild pneumonia7. Previous infection data indicated that 19 percent of infections result in severe, potentially life-threating disease characterized by shortness of breath, rapid respiratory rates, lung infiltrates, and oxygen desaturation <94%6,8,9. Due to the rapid viral spread, it is imperative that safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 be immediately developed for ease of worldwide deployment to end the pandemic. Despite the authorization of three vaccines for emergency use in the United States11-13 and the release of several more vaccines worldwide13-16, SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to outpace the administration of vaccines in several countries across the globe demonstrating that the current vaccine supply is far from sufficient. In India alone, there were 6 million new infections and 46 thousand new deaths in the month of April6. Some of the currently authorized vaccines are mRNA-based and have unique cold storage and distribution requirements that present extra challenges to the world17,18. Vaccines that can offer improved safety and tolerability profiles could help overcome vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, the development of vaccines that are temperature stable can help to improve the global distribution to countries with little or no capacity for cold storage.”",

It's not even a year the company went public via DPO and he sold over 14 million shares already. His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively)

Now let's look at some **counter arguments**\-

**Automatic sell:**

Looking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public?

**DPO vs IPO:**

You might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true.

**Stock-based Compensations**:

You might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?

**He needs money like everyone else:**

Another argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more.

**TlDr:** Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently. If he does not like the stock of his company then who the hell am I.",['MMM']
