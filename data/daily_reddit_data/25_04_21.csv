Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Today will also be my final stock market forecast.

I'm not tired of doing this, and nothing has soured me on this experience. My problem is the exact opposite. My problem is that I *love* stocks.

When I'm supposed to be working, I'm secretly watching a stock ticker. When I'm supposed to be spending time with my family, I'm secretly checking market news. And when I'm lying in bed with my wife, I have my phone on so that I can see how futures are reacting to resistance and support lines.

I think about stocks *all the time*. 

It's getting a little unhealthy.

* Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.
* The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company and the reason for them publicly traded is because of **risk**. Sailing all over the planet was too risky for any company during that time. Ships were lost, fortunes were squandered, and financiers realized they had to do something to mitigate all that risk.
* Early stock trading happened at **Coffee shops,** and stocks were hand written in paper and inventors had to trade their stocks with other investors in coffee shops.
* It was tough to make out legit companies to illegitimate companies back in the day, and in many cases companies were able to make tons of money before a single ship was ever set for sail. And because of that a bubble was burst and the government of England banned the issuing of shares until 1825.
* And despite ban of issues shares, **London Stock Exchange** was established in 1801, it was very limited exchange because of the ban of issuing shares.
* And in 1817, **New York stock exchange** was established and it started trading since its very first day.
* And today, almost every single country has a stock market.  Every day, trillions of dollars are traded on stock markets.

my003t,,stocks,post,1619321921,"Why Analyst Sees AirTags As A $10B Opportunity For Apple""Apple unveiled its Bluetooth trackers dubbed “AirTags” on Tuesday at its “Spring Loaded” virtual event. The product represents a $10 billion opportunity for Apple, according to Raymond James & Associates.

The Apple Analyst: Raymond James analyst Chris Caso has an Outperform 2 rating on the Cupertino, California-based tech giant with a price target of $160.

The Apple Thesis: Caso said that AirTags are akin to AirPods in terms of potential growth for the Tim Cook-led company as they would strengthen its ecosystem and encourage upgrades.

“We believe this product category will have very broad appeal (who wouldn't pay $30 to not lose your wallet?), and as such could grow to become a $10 billion opportunity,” wrote Caso in a note Tuesday.

In Raymond James' estimate, AirPods sell with an annual volume of nearly 70-80 million units.

“At $30 per Air Tag (or $99 for 4), if Air Tags were to sell at a similar unit volume as AirPods, that would put annual AirTag revenue at $2 – 2.5 billion,” as per Caso.

The analyst theorized that it is reasonable that AirTags would sell at a much higher unit volume compared to AirPods as users buy multiple units to tag items such as wallets and keys.

“We wouldn’t be surprised to see AirTags grow to be a $10 billion business over time, putting that product close to AirPods in terms of revenue impact.”

Precision AirTag tracking is only available for users of iPhone 11 and above and provides an incentive for users to upgrade, according to Caso.

This month, Apple said it would let third-party companies use its “Find My” tracking network, which means third-party products can now be tracked using devices made by the Tim Cook-led company.

Anecdotally, I lost my key-fob while on a walk a while back and was fully prepared to pay ~$200 to replace it, but luckily nice people found it on the path and it was returned to me a few days later.

I won’t be surprised if he would rather embezzle more money trying to impeach him again 😂😂😂😂,
mxmbli,,stocks,post,1619278531,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
> Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
> It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
> As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> # The central bank takes the main stage
> “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
> So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
> There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
> The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
> “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
> Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
> Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
> The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
> “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
> Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
> # Tax hike prospects
> Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
> Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
> Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
> “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
> So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
> David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
> “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
> He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
> “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
> “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
> He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
> Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
> “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

> # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

> As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

> Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

> Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

> # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

> The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

> After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

> The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

> The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

> # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

> “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

> One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

> After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

> “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

> # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

> It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

> We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

> U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

> A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

> # Dips in Short Supply

> While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

> In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

> Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

> # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

> If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**

> The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

> It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

mxmbli,gvq3b38,stocks,comment,1619282103,"Thanks for the almanac trader.

Personally I don't focus too much on individual stocks and instead pay attention to the overall markets. If the Nasdaq goes down, pretty much all stocks go down with it.

Nasdaq currently at 14016 with a 52 week high of 14175. SP500, 4200 appears to be the target number. Guessing both targets need to be hit  for at least a MINOR market correction/dip/entry point. Biden has a big speech on the 28th and he's known to set new market records every time he talks.

My best guess a dip Mon/Tuesday, Wed/Thur new market records because of Bidens speech and Friday no idea.",['NDAQ']
my7371,,stocks,post,1619352771,"VTI vs VOO - they are almost the same.I have seen several posts about these two indices and people often say that VTI is a better bet because it is so much more diversified. Well... yes and no. 

VOO has around 500 companies and tracks S&P 500 index. 

VTI has around 3,500 companies and tracks CRSP US Total Market index. 

So yes, 3,500 companies vs 500 is more diversified. However both these indices are market weighted. Which means that the larger the company the more allocation it has in the index. Because of that, and because how giant S&P 500 companies are in comparison to the other 3,000 smaller companies, 95% of VTI is S&P 500. So 95% of VTI is VOO.  Check out their historical performance - very close. I wish I could paste a graph here. 

So their performance is almost identical. VOO has a slightly higher dividend yield. Fee is the same - 3bps. 

Funny thing is that although VTI is more diversified, it has slightly higher historical volatility.

At the end - either fund is fine. However if you truly want to have non-S&P exposure, you should add VXF (or maybe VO) as a complement to VOO. 

Also, VTI is total US market. No international exposure. So VXUS might be a good companion as well if you want some outside of US exposure.",['SPGI']

my22w6,,stocks,post,1619330287,"Arrival - UK based EV Startup backed by UPS, thoughts?Hi all, getting ready for a busy week ahead in earnings. I am trying to figure out what to make out of Arrival, an EV startup founded by a Russian guy who doesn't know anything about EVs and they're trying to do bold and daring things such as abandoning the classic approach of manufacturing cars with this new microfactories concept.

I checked their website and they're hiring left and right. About 1500 employees already and they're growing rapidly. Current market cap is around $10B which is 1/6th of Ford and 1/60th of Tesla.

Company looks pretty solid. Currently trading under ARVL. Any thoughts?

NYTimes recently wrote about it: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/business/arrival-electric-vehicles.html","['UPS', 'TSLA']"
my22w6,gvsoajm,stocks,comment,1619335035,"SPAC with an order book of 1.2B, expecting revenue to reach 14.1B by 2024.  That is one hell of a tough hill to climb.

Microfactories are neat and innovative, but because they are micro they cannot vertically integrate fully I am assuming.  This will put some pressure on margins, but they will benefit on margins as well from their in house tech.

I don't see anything particularly innovative about their vehicles, most of their expertise seems to be manufacturing related, but will have to be proven at steady state.  Would be cool to see them team up with a major manufacturer as a provider of manufacturing tech.

I would wait on this one and watch it.  Last mile delivery is a competitive space, buses also.  They need to be able to offer a product with automation features, which seem to be coming from Waymo potentially, who could just as easily partner with their competitors on any fleet tenders.

https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/29/ups-deliveries-arrival-vans-waymo/

I would need to start see their order book build with other clients, otherwise they might not succeed.  Amazon went with Rivian.  USPS  went with Oshkosh.  

I don't know enough about their product to say why they didn't get those contracts, but I feel like maybe they're missing something... who knows, maybe they've got something in the works.  Lazy me says that a 130kwh battery for their vans that only produces 160km of range is not efficient or leading edge tech, but I didn't dig into the load assumptions, nor the driving conditions used to come up with that figure.

Considering that they're trading for almost 8x their booked revenues and haven't actually produced en masse yet, this is pretty high risk.

Please feel free to correct any of the above.  I am neither long nor short this stock.  If you can tell me why their product is better than their competitors, I will do some further DD.","['UPS', 'AMZN']"

It was all engineered by third party automotive firms in Coventry all ex JLR guys, the concept being based around what a company called Local Motors did a few years ago who I also worked for and they were rolling in money fast, I think the micro factory system has legs.

The vehicle is basically designed to be a knock down kit you can screw together by hand, it’s all rotation molded parts around a chassis made of extrusions so it’s easy to ship and parts can be made by third parties anywhere in the world on the cheap which makes expansion much easier.

So that's pretty good news for TSLA.  Interestingly enough I've recently heard TSLA is now 'cheaper' than Peleton based on analysts forward earnings projections.... but those projections also place the current price of TSLA at what it should be worth in early 2023 (current fair value of ~$435).

That's not to say break-throughs/unexpected can't push that timeline up (or down).  I'm definitely a strong believer in TSLA's future and if you're long there's probably no great harm in investing now, other than potentially sacrificing investment time in the meantime (if this projection is correct).",['TSLA']
mxnrlg,,stocks,post,1619282861,"Ultimate HUYA DDThis is my excuse to dodge parenthood & stuff so I better make it a long one.

PART I:

1. Fundamentals: Can't post pictures here but look it up on YCharts. 

I generally use PS Ratio for growth tech stocks. Definition: PS Ratio = Price / Revenue Per Share (Note: YCharts uses the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Revenue Per Share in the denominator). Most growth tech companies are as low as 10 on the low side up to 30. Generally I try to catch companies I'm bullish on around 10; 2.7 is stupid low. This is the biggest streaming company in China and is avidly sought after by Tencent. Massive market and massive growth industry. Their PS is crazy low. The Price to Book Value is also fucking awesome for a growth tech company. Value investors look for companies less than 3 and this fits that parameter. This company is also jacked to the gills with cash. Check out their balance sheet. As of Q4 2020 their total assets are 12.4B and their total liabilities are 2.6B. They have 3.2B in pure cash. Year over year this company is putting out blow out numbers but their Q4 contracted a bit vs their Q3 of last year. But seriously: 3.2B in cash and the market cap is just over 4B. What kind of absurd mismatch is this especially when it is a money printing business too.

2) Technical/Price-Action/Analyst stuff: (had a picture from TD Ameritrade analyst reports)

6 Analysts projections: upper-bound is $29 and the median price target is $25.66. The stock jumped today a bit on news that the stock just got a buy rating: HUYA shares are trading higher after 86 Research upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a price target of $22 per share. We all know analysts are a bunch of pencil pushing idiots so take that with a grain of salt. Currently the price is $18.5 AH and it hasn't traded this low since July of 2020. The price was north of $35 as recent as a couple months ago. It has been consolidating at the $18 level waiting for news which brings us to the meat and potatoes of this post.

3: Proposed merger and Arbitrage strategy: The two biggest streaming companies in China are HUYA and DOYU. The King Maker aka Tencent is trying to merge these companies as they will dominate and have 80% market share if the merger is successful. Tencent has a major stake in both companies and a huge vested interest strategically as they are a video game company (among other things) and this would have vertical integration characteristics. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will be converted to .75 HUYA shares. The arbitrage strategy here is going long shares on DOYU and people shorting the hell out of HUYA. The amount of short interest on HUYA shows that the market is confident the merger will go through. If it DOESN'T go through then HUYA will no longer be shorted and the stock will sky rocket. If the merger DOES go through then you'll have a stake in the biggest streaming company in the biggest streaming market on planet earth.

4) Headwinds: China used BABA to send a message to monopolistic behavior. This was great news for the HUYA/DOYU merger because the uncertainty surrounding Beijeng's agenda was lifted a bit. Major companies, including Tencent, came out publicly to say they will make concessions where necessary. I expect this will hasten the negotiations between Tencent and Beijeng to get this through. The current time table for this merger to happen is the first half of 2021, which we are well on our way to the 2nd half. It is possible for this to happen in the 2nd half if negotiations stall. The other slight headwind is that DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling concerns but this is completely short run shit that gives me a better discount.

5) Institutional ownership: 52.4% of outstanding shares are owned by institutions. The two biggest players are ARK and Morgan Stanley. Fintel shows Morgan Stanley increasing their HUYA stake by 169% in the most recent filing to 22,095,743 shares (32% of the comany). Ark has the next most with 11,600,993 shares for 13.99%. (Check Fintel Huya Institutional ownership for this info)

6) Short Interest: Check the massive SI on this ticker. (Check shortsight for this info. free to subscribe and get daily updates)

34.4% of the float is shorted and 52.4% of the outstanding shares are owned by institutions. That leaves a fairly small left-over float size to publicly trade.

Mama CWood loves the stock. Massive institutional ownership with Morgan Stanley just making a huge investment. Pending merger. Artificially suppressed aka arbitrage short. I LIKE THE STOCK. I am playing the HUYA side with long calls and shares. It is a win win if the merger does or does not go through.

PART II:

The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. (this is found in many places, google it to confirm)

I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings)

You  will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares  Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public  (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the  float). (I had this picture from shortsight data but can't post pictures on this thread).

34.4% of the float is  shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and  assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the  arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491  gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if  you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares  Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The  float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get  11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has  11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us  retail gamblers.

Practically the  entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an  incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely  shorted. The fundamentals are the prettiest thing I've ever seen when it  comes to analyzing stocks.

Now I just need to decide if I sell out of literally everything and put it into HUYA","['NDAQ', 'MS', 'GOOGL']"

mxt8ow,,stocks,post,1619299133,"Fubo Analysis - Why I Own It and Am Bullish Long term
(Cross posted from Fubo’s investor subreddit and WSB)

I’ve been meaning to get all of my thoughts into one place and now seems like the perfect time to do so after the stocks been down so much. I think a lot of people have let their emotions get to them and have just been thinking irrationally, as nothing has fundamentally changed.

For context I own 1,142 shares at $24.55 avg cost. My fair value of this stock as of right now is $30 a share but I have a PT of $40 EOY. Anything around this price is an absolute steal.

So why are people bearish on Fubo in the first place? 

- There’s a lot of competition when it comes to live streaming services.

This is definitely true, however a lot of these companies will never be profitable. The costs are plentiful and it takes a lot of subscribers to actually become profitable. I’ll explain why Fubo can become profitable a lot easier than other services later on.

There’s obviously more bear cases, but that is the main one I wanted to talk about.

Now onto some positive points and why I plan to hold Fubo for years.

- 75 million Americans have yet to cut the cord, and 43% said they plan to in the next 12 months.

- Fubo makes more money per user than any other streaming service ($70 per month and growing)

- Fubo’s main demographic is the most profitable when it comes to ad revenue. 

- Fubo plans on eventually making $20 per user per month in ad revenue, already increasing 174% since last quarter.

Now let’s get to what you all want to hear... sports betting.

To put it in perspective of how big sports betting actually is, 140 million Americans placed a bet on some sporting event in 2008! (Yes, 2008. Years ago when not as many states allowed it).
For even more perspective, Draft Kings has 565,000 active monthly users, and brought in $644M in revenue in 2020 (around $1200 per user). Their company is worth $25B. So why will sports betting help Fubo? 

- Sports betting is extremely profitable, especially prop bets etc. (I’ll touch on this a bit later)

- Fubo did a survey amongst its users and said that 22% of their users would put $100 a month into sports betting. Before I go any further, I think it will be around 30-35% as people will join Fubo for the sports book alone, and the convenience of everything.

- Assumimg that Fubo grows as it has been, they would bring in around $300M alone in revenue off the sports book. (Doesn’t include Advertising and Subscription revenue.) This is nearly half of draft kings last year revenue, again, a $25B company. 

- Fubo can place prop bets/betting slips of any game you’re watching. For example, you’re watching a Lakers game and Lebron gets fouled, they can place a betting slip for you to bet instantly that Lebron makes both free throws.

- Fubo can use your data from betting to make ad revenue even more profitable. 

- Fubo is in a much better position than YouTubeTV because of their sports betting addition. Fubo could essentially run their subscription at a loss, and either undercut YTTV’s monthly price, or add back the channels that they lost (Turner Channels specifically). 
From then on it wouldn’t make sense to stay with YTTV, as Fubo has much more channels and RSN’s.

Edit: if you have any concerns/questions just ask, trying to get better at analysis. I’ve studied this company more than any I have before, and am more confident long term than ever.",

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. 



2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.



3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.

When the stock hits 4000 or 4500, questions of whether 3300 is expensive will be painful to reflect on.

Furthermore, the company has so much potential to grow. They’re in cloud, they’re in streaming. What’s next - Amazon banking? Amazon mortgages? I see London has an Amazon supermarket now - I personally believe they’ll be the largest company in the world in the next few years.

Given the current low rate environment, bonds have become a lackluster investment. Rates have reached the lowest they have had ever, and it seems we have bottomed rates.

Here’s my thought. Why have bonds at all right now? If rates rise, won’t the principle value of the bond go down? I mean unless you hold the bond until maturity, which long term bonds suck right now.

Wouldn’t it be better to have cash over bonds right now? At least with Cash, you have opportunity to buy at a discount when we see a correction.

mxgz17,gvpwu5v,stocks,comment,1619279718,"My biggest concern with QYLD is that because it sells covered calls against 100% of their holdings it leads to little to no capital appreciation, is highly sensitive to market downturns, & takes longer to recover. But if you're parking a large amount of money for a few years, the dividends should outweigh the depreciation. Excluding distributions it's down 15% since 2014, but it's cumulative return is 87% for the same period. 

Another fund that caught my eye when researching QYLD was the new QYLG. Launched in November & the volume is still ridiculously low (~3000 shares daily). It sells covered calls against 50% of it's holdings & keeps the other 50% long. It captures 50% of the Nasdaq's upside & pays a 6% annual distribution paid out on a monthly basis.

mx4mf7,,stocks,post,1619210530,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 23, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 23, 2021**

Stocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.

Yesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. 

However, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

What if Tesla were to announce that instead of selling a car for say $50,000 ... it sells it for 1 bitcoin instead (regardless of the $-value of bitcoin). Right now bitcoin is ~$50,000 so its about an even tradeoff.

Now... what if Tesla were to instead sell that $50,000 car for 0.1 bitcoin? Do you think that Tesla's pricing would be powerful enough to shoot the price of bitcoin higher (theoretically up to 10x)? 

If bitcoin goes up, Tesla could make a pretty penny on its stake if it decides to sell.

DAU growth is also solid

>• DAUs were 280 million in Q1 2021, an increase of 51 million, or 22%, year-over-year.• DAUs increased sequentially and year-over-year in each of North America, Europe, and Rest of World.• DAUs increased sequentially and year-over-year on both iOS and Android platforms.• For the first time, the majority of our DAUs for the quarter were on the Android version of our application.

The stock is up after the report dropped.

**Outlook**

>Q2 2021 Outlook• Revenue is estimated to be between $820 million and $840 million, compared to $454 million in Q2 2020.• Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be between $(20) million and breakeven, compared to $(96) million in Q2 2020.

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive.

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price.

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of growth figures is required to get great returns.",['GOOGL']

mwzgik,,stocks,post,1619196180,"Does Anyone In This Sub Take Risks? Or is Everyone Just in SPY/Funds/Big Tech?During this major \~10 week long correction for growth stocks, I can't help but notice that the vast majority of people on this sub seem to have changed their investment strategy completely(unless most people are just new and super bearish because they lost money). Any mention of any growth company gets met with negative, pessimistic and unrealistic attitude. Everyone says to stay away from 'reddit stocks' which seems to be the new term for 'meme stocks'.

Ever since everything that happened with Gamestop, it now seems taboo to invest in anything that isn't MSFT or AAPL or SPY. There used to be more discussion surrounding undervalued stocks. Discussion surrounding anything other than value has diminished almost entirely and everyone asking for advice surrounding growth just gets the same mindless response from the zombies that infest this sub. ""No revenue = Shit company,"" ""Don't buy anything you see people talk about on reddit,"" ""Hype for growth stocks is dead"" so on and so forth.

Ignoring the fact that 95% of all growth stocks just dropped anywhere from 30-70% in the last couple months(and some are prime for loading up), why does everyone still seem to think that everything is overvalued? Why does it seem like almost no one is talking about investing with the future in mind. Everyone is only talking about today/short term, and most people seem very bearish about literally any investment. 

I never really think to follow this advice, but in my opinion I haven't seen this fearful of a market in the 3 years I've been investing. I haven't been around for the longest but I do know that most of the pessimism surrounding growth right now is unreasonable and downright stupid. I've been using this opportunity to 'be greedy when others are fearful'. I have allocated a decent amount of my portfolio betting on growth stocks that get all the hype when they're going up, but everyone hates them when they're going down. 

'Last years picks' is a term I hear a lot lately, and I find it funny. Everyone wants a piece of the pie that no one can afford but when everyone can afford it, no one talks about it. It's really interesting to see how many people are willing to jump into a S.P.@.C. or a growth company after it shoots up 300%, and when it corrects people don't make the reasonable conclusion of 'maybe I bought the hype and now I need to ask myself if it's worth holding and if I like this company'. Instead, the overwhelming sentiment becomes 'Man, this company is shit. Why the hell did I buy it? It would be better to sell at a loss, forget about this company and put it all into SPY, the safer play.' I don't know who has noticed, but value is at all time highs and growth is at all time lows. Which has more room to grow, and which seems like the better investment right now? I think it's obvious.

When most sectors are down on no news, it clearly has nothing to do with the company. EVs, Gene stocks, growth stocks, S.P.@.Cs, etc etc are all down rn. That doesn't mean the companies are all garbage and going bankrupt like most people are saying. If one stock drops 30% because of bad news, understandable, but that's not the current situation.","['AAPL', 'MSFT']"

The more cash that is out of the market the quicker the stock market will recover (unless there is a better place to put that money to work). Since there is no better place to put that money any 5 to 10 percent dip will start bringing the ""new money"" back into the market.

When everyone is tapped out and all their cash is in the market those corrections hurt. They have left no room for purchasing more shares and closing positions to free up cash becomes a logical move. This compounds the selling off of a particular stock.

mx1dxo,,stocks,post,1619201396,"My Alteryx (AYX) DD: I'm not buying this dip.After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX. Also, I had to remove 2 links to some of my figures/research due to this subs policy, so you'll see I just refer to ""an analyst."" Most everything else is cited though.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets (link removed).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, an analyst (link removed) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares.","['NDAQ', 'MMM']"

Is this the case?",
mx91qa,gvn17z7,stocks,comment,1619231077,"Yes, options count.

Selling a share and buying an option in that same security also counts. And vice versa.

The tax implications are not as bad as you think. You need to read the whole rule and understand it. Yes, your loss is disallowed, but the loss is added to the cost basis of the security when you rebuy. 

Ultimately, when you finally sell the security without rebuying  your losses and profits from every transaction that was strung together by the wash sale rule gets netted out. You only pay taxes on your net gain.

The rule becomes a problem when you string together transactions across multiple tax years. You may end up paying on your gains in one year, while all your disallowed losses get carried forward to future year.

Example, Dec 1, you buy one stock at $100. Dec 15, you sell the share for $1 taking a $99 loss. Someone calls you a paper handed bitch, and so you rebuy the share at $1  on Dec 16. 

On Dec 30, you sell the stock for $50. Again, someone calls you a paper handed bitch, and you rebuy Dec 31 for exactly $50.  Jan 2, the new year,  the stock goes back to $1 and you sell and decide that you will stick to giving handies in the alley behind a Wendy's.

In year 1, you pay taxes on $49 gain ($1 to $50). The $99 loss from $100 to $1 is disallowed. 

In year 2, you get to report $148 in losses. The $50 rebuy on Dec 31 has a cost basis of  $149 (equal to $50 purchase price, plus the $99 loss that gets added to the cost basis). When you finally sell the stock at $1, you use the high $149  cost basis, for a total net loss of -$148 in year 2.

Net over the two years, you show $98 in losses ($49 profit year one, $148 loss in year two).  Checking the math, you had $100 at the start, and sold for $1 twice, so a net loss of $98 over the two years looks right.",

A deeper dive into their financial history doesn’t improve their outlook either. Dilution, debt, and doubt.

So why would anyone invest in this company? Better yet, why would anyone spend a single moment of their valuable time researching this company when everything they need to know is right out there in the open? Had I looked at this company a few months ago I might have come to that exact conclusion...

But on March 3, 2021… everything changed.

[**Meet Azstarys**](https://azstarys.com)

Azstarys is KemPharm’s latest FDA-approved medication specifically formulated for the treatment of ADHD. A once daily pill of **serdexmethylphenidate** and **dexmethylphenidate**. This is undoubtably decent news but, despite the medication showing promising potential, this alone wasn’t enough to convince me to make my investment.

The first glimmer of potential that caught my eye appeared, like most things about this company, in the smallest of details. If you have ADHD as I do, you may have noticed that you’ve never heard of **SER**dexmethylphenidate. Dexmethylphenidate, the more active isomer of methylphenidate, is in Focalin and Focalin XR but the **SER** is a new development.

Looking deeper into Azstarys, I noted that SERdexmethylphenidate was described as a **prodrug**.

And the only other ADHD med with that designation is **Vyvanse**.

I was familiar with Vyvanse because it was my prescription prior to Focalin XR. But I wasn’t familiar of why it was called a prodrug so I decided to dig a little deeper.

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

…and deeper…

...until I found a thread...

A thread that led me all the way back to the year 2006. A year where a man by the name of Dr. Travis Mickle made a rather important discovery.

>“Prior to founding KemPharm, Dr. Mickle served as Director of Drug Discovery and CMC at New River Pharmaceuticals where he was the principal inventor of Vyvanse®, a prodrug of amphetamine for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Today, Vyvanse is the branded market share leader in the estimated $17 billion plus ADHD market. The success of Vyvanse along with a robust pipeline of prodrugs targeting ADHD, pain and thyroid dysfunctions, which Dr. Mickle was responsible for creating, led to New River Pharmaceuticals being acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals, PLC for $2.6 billion.”

Source: [https://kempharm.com/team/](https://kempharm.com/team/)

In 2006, after tendering his resignation to New River Pharmaceuticals, the MickleMeister founded KemPharm with the sole intention of producing a plethora of prodrugs. Shortly after his departure, New River Pharmaceuticals was purchased by Shire for the bargain price of $2.6 billion. I say bargain because Vyvanse now generates around $2 billion dollars in revenue every single year.

Subsequently, Shire was purchased by Takeda in 2019 for the slightly higher price of $62 billion but this information will come into play a little later.

**So this begs the question; how did Vyvanse, a single ADHD medication, create such eye-watering returns on an, at the time, equally eye-watering $2.6 billion dollar investment?**

The answer, once again, is hidden in the itty bitty details. Vyvanse is a **prodrug** of dextroamphetamine known as **LIS**dexamfetamine. And here is where the pattern finally begins to align (after 800 words of backstory, damn).

Basically, a prodrug is a modified version of a drug that attaches another molecule, a ligand in Azstarys’s case, that renders the active ingredient inert unless cleaved through your body's metabolic processes.

In summary, **it only work if you eat it.**

This has quite a few benefits. Not least of which is a longer duration as your body can only metabolize things so quickly due to the limitations of enzymatic action. This ""gating"" effect even has the potential to reduce side effects. **Essentially a prodrug can improve qualities of the base medication.**

But the more important distinction is that **you can patent it**.

Shire already had experience with ADHD medications. They’re flagship product Adderall XR had seen monumental success but was about to go off-patent. This would expose Shire to the profit-decimating world of generics and so they eyeballed Vyvanse, being the novel prodrug lisdexamfetamine, for its brand new patent. Considering Shire’s experienced sales team and established connections, converting Adderall users to Vyvanse would likely be as easy as informing doctor’s and pharmacies of Vyvanse’s improved qualities.

**SO WHAT?!**

“So what?” I hear you ask. Apples and oranges. That’s a different drug with a different company so what does it have to do with KemPharm and Azstarys? I promise you, all of this backstory was necessary to explain exactly why KemPharm has so much potential.

\------------------------------------------------------------

**PART II - CONTRACTS, CORIUM, CAPITAL**

\------------------------------------------------------------

Azstarys will be brought to market Summer 2021 through their partner company Corium Inc.

[**Meet Corium**](https://corium.com)

The sales contract between the companies offers up to $590M in sales and regulatory milestone guarantees in addition to tiered royalty payments ranging from \~9% to \~25%. This contract was recently renegotiated from $468M to $590M with a new higher top-level royalty tier and the addition of 4 new sales milestones guarantees in exchange for $28M less on the upfront. All in all, a decent agreement. Not earth-shattering but probably good enough to keep KemPharm afloat for the foreseeable future.

**But this still isn’t enough to warrant an investment.**

Guarantees mean nothing unless the drug can sell. Sure, Azstarys is a prodrug but the performance of Vyvanse can’t guarantee the success of Azstarys especially considering that Corium doesn’t have the sales experience of Shire.

**…but what if they did?**

>“We all know that having the product is key, but you also have to have a team that can effectively ramp up the distribution in order to be a blockbuster. More than a decade ago, Vyvanse was picked up by Shire. Shire had an ‘ace team,’ led by **Perry Sternberg,** that did a superb job in commercialization.”



The current CEO of Corium is **Perry Sternberg**. The very same Perry Sternberg that spearheaded the commercialization of Vyvanse during his tenure at Shire. That alone raises an eyebrow but I invite you to go to Corium’s website and look at their “Leadership” page: [https://corium.com/leadership.html](https://corium.com/leadership.html)

Tell me if you can spot the pattern:

Robyn Lynch, Head of Corporate Strategy - **Former Chief of Staff for U.S. Commercial Business and Neuroscience Division at Shire.**

John Miller, CFO - **Former Head of Finance for Global Commercial at Shire.**

John Neeley, Head of Market Access - **Former Head of Market Access at Shire.**

Jamie Spaeth, Head of HR - **Former Head of HR at Shire.**

When I saw this I couldn't help but ask myself, ""Why the hell are all these former Shire heads now working at Corium?""

The answer… **Gurnet Point Capital.**

>Travis Mickle, CEO: ""Why are we co-hosting this event today with our partner Corium? We actually entered into a worldwide license with Gurnet Point Capital that was announced back in September of 2019. Corium is a GPC portfolio company, and they have been assigned the rights to commercialize this product for GPC and for KemPharm. \[…\] We're excited about this, because through our license process, to look for the right partner, certainly, at one point Shire would have made a lot of sense. Certainly, Takeda had their own agendas, and we are so fortunate that Perry and much of his team has landed at Corium and they've had the foresight to bring in a product like KP415. Certainly, this is the team that knows how to advance a product like this, and it's a very exciting opportunity.”

Ok... **so** **who is Gurnet Point Capital?**

[**Meet Gurnet Point Capital**](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com)

Gurnet Point Capital (GPC) is a healthcare fund founded by **Ernesto Bertarelli**, former CEO of Serono.

>“The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialization and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies. It is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole.  
>  
>Consistent with the amount of capital, time and energy that it dedicates, Gurnet Point Capital will generally seek to be, over time, the majority – or at least principal - investor in each of its companies.”

Source: [https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about](https://www.gurnetpointcapital.com/about)

In late 2018 Gurnet Point Capital purchased Corium for a flat fee of $500 million. The former CEO, Peter Staple, was replaced with Perry Sternberg in April of 2019. But it wasn’t just Sternyburgy that came along for the ride. GPC made a point to acquire his entire team. **Specifically the team that made Vyvanse a commercial success.** So why did they feel the need to recruit this exact team from Shire?

The answer… **Azstarys.**

Obviously this has been a lot of information so let me try to summarize everything I’ve detailed so far:

1. KemPharm looks ugly.
2. KemPharm’s drug Azstarys approved on March 3, 2021.
3. Azstarys is a prodrug.
4. The only other ADHD prodrug is Vyvanse.
5. Vyvanse was made by Travis Mickle.
6. Travis Mickle is the CEO of KemPharm.
7. Azstarys will be sold through a partnership with Corium.
8. Corium is has the Shire team that sold Vyvanse.
9. Corium is owned by Gurnet Point Capital.
10. Gurnet Point Capital is owned by Ernesto Bertarelli.

The thread is long and winding but the details are out there in the open. You can look up and verify every single piece of information so far and I encourage you to do so and come to your own conclusions. But I assure you that all of this information was needed to understand this next part.

\------------------------------------------------------

**PART III - MARKETS, MONEY, MATH**

\------------------------------------------------------

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE PERSONAL OPINIONS —**

What follows from this point on is my investment thesis and represents the reason why I decided to make a substantial investment into KemPharm. I want to be very clear that **this is not financial advice nor a recommendation that you should invest in this company. As always, do your own research.**

With that warning out of the way, let's talk about **the stock.**

During KemPharm’s latest Earnings Call on March 11, 2021, Travis Mickle and team detailed the various changes that have taken place just in the past few months:

1. Stock relisted on NASDAQ effective JAN 8, 2021.
2. No debt as of FEB 8, 2021.
3. $77M Cash on Hand as of MAR 10, 2021
4. 28.3M Shares Outstanding as of MAR 10, 2021
5. 38.6M Fully diluted shares as of MAR 10, 2021

Source: [https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/q4-2020)

All of these events occurred in Q1 and have led to considerable confusion across the internet in regards to the accuracy of information regarding KMPH. But taking these new developments into account, a very different picture begins to form in regards to KemPharm’s future.

The current stock price as of the very moment I’m writing this is $8.70.

Assuming a full dilution of all 38.6M shares that gives a market cap of \~$340M. Accounting for Cash on Hand, that means that \~$260M of this company’s worth is attributed to Azstarys, Apadaz, their pipeline, their technology, and Dr. Mickle’s brain in a jar.

NOTE: This doesn't account for cash due from converted warrants and approval guarantees which could net an additional \~$80M and bring their CoH to \~$150M. This will be clarified in the next ER.

Taking all of this into consideration, I asked myself 2 questions:

1. What market share MUST Azstarys capture in order to sustain KemPharm’s operations for the foreseeable future?
2. Will KemPharm be able to innovate with future products?

To answer the first question, I needed to gain a better understanding of the ADHD market as a whole. The \~$18B industry currently has 21 existing treatments spread across 3 primary classes:

1. Amphetamines
2. Methylphenidates
3. Non-stimulants

The current largest player in the field is Vyvanse at a whopping **13%** of the TOTAL market and **18%** of the stimulant category (class 1 & 2). Competitors like Focalin XR & Concerta comprise about **1%** each.

So we have some comparatives for market performance but I still prefer to take the pessimistic approach. My question is, what is the bare minimum performance required to simply **NOT GO BANKRUPT**.

According to KemPharm they have a projected **Annual** **Cash Burn of \~$4M** [**(source)**](https://www.transcriptshare.com/s/kmph/kp415-approval-call)

Considering this and assuming a low-ball **10% royalty rate** (\~8-25% potential) with only **5% of the potential $550M** in milestone guarantees received over a 10 year period, how much market size would Azstarys have to capture in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt in a **worst case scenario?**

**— WARNING: HERE THERE BE NAPKIN MATH —**

(operating expenses) = (total annual market)(required market share)(royalty rate) + ((milestone payments)(percent received))/(10 year period)

x = required market share

($4,000,000) = ($18,000,000,000)(x)(0.1) + (($550,000,000)(0.05))/(10)

4,000,000 = 1,800,000,000x + 2,750,000

1,250,000 = 1,800,000,000x

x = 0.00069 = **0.069% required market share**

This obviously relies on guesswork and doesn’t account for things like CAGR, taxes, manufacturing costs, or inflation, so let’s make it even harder for KemPharm and **double the required market share.**

So in order for KemPharm to not go bankrupt, assuming they sit on their ass and do nothing until the end of time, Azstarys needs just **0.14%** of the market or **$25.2M** in average annual sales over a 10 year period to earn an income of $4M. Obviously this ignores the scaling royalty rate and any further sales milestones but I prefer err on the side of caution when making wild, speculative assumptions. Helps to keep things in perspective.

So that's the bare minimum amount that Azstarys is allowed to suck before KemPharm implodes. Should Azstarys manage to perform on the same level as the lower competitors at around **1%**  you would certainly see a rise in KemPharm's stock price even with a below-average P/E ratio. And given their partner Corium's experience with the commercialization of Vyvanse there's very little reason to believe that this goal couldn't be achieved.

**Furthermore,** **I believe that Azstarys will exceed it.**

\------------------------------------------------

**PART IV - ALL AHEAD AZSTARYS**

\------------------------------------------------

**It is my personal belief** that KemPharm has crossed the threshold of uncertainty and has secured the financial stability necessary to confidently pursue the development of exponentially more prodrugs.

**I believe** that KemPharm's partner Corium has the ideal combination of experience and financial backing to optimize Azstarys's success.

**I believe** that Azstarys offers unique benefits that will improve the quality of care for patients with ADHD, myself included.

**I believe that KemPharm is** **extremely undervalued**.

To view KemPharm as a company in peril is simply a matter of outdated information. It seems to me that their value is hidden beneath layers of historical uncertainty and investor pessimism which makes it an excellent buying opportunity for those capable and willing to see its potential.

The arguments that Azstarys will fail to be competitive against its competitors or generics doesn’t hold water considering the fact that Azstarys **has** **no therapeutic equivalents** [**(source)**](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process) and is patented until 2037.

An additional point is that Azstarys was approved for all ages 6 and up [**(https://www.azstarys.com)**](https://www.azstarys.com) instead of just 6-17 which was a surprise inclusion upon approval and serves to further expand the potential market.

The FDA also included a section in the label with clinical data suggesting that Azstarys has **reduced impedance of childhood growth and development** [**(Section 6.1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf). This particular issue is often cited as the primary complaint from parents of children with ADHD.

Critics of Azstarys focus heavily on the obscurity of it’s potential duration **(the often referenced 30/13)** and consider the inclusion of a chart without this specific language on the label as sufficient cause for dismissal. To me, this argument comes from a place of ignorance and a severe lack of perspective. Yes, certain terms of the sales agreement are contingent on this specific language but this point has yet to be confirmed or denied.

Furthermore this language's effect on actual sales is largely overestimated. All extended release products are long lasting by design but the key differentiating factor between Azstarys and its competitors is that it is, in fact, a prodrug. And as a prodrug its primary differentiation between it and other medications is the **smooth downward efficacy ramp** as the body metabolizes the medication at a consistent rate. [**(Section 12.3 Figure 1)**](https://www.azstarys.com/assets/pdf/AZSTARYS_PI_ENGLISH_US.pdf)

To put it plainly, other extended release products are equivalent to a **caffeine crash**. I know this because I experience it every single day.

The more interesting takeaway is that this medication’s formula and prodrug status allows it to differentiate from not just Methylphenidate products, **but from Vyvanse itself.**

The primary criticism for Vyvanse is its slow onset [**(Up to 1.5 Hours)**](https://www.psycom.net/vyvanse-lisdexamfetamine) but Azstarys is formulated with instant release dexmethylphenidate alongside serdexmethylphenidate for faster onset. **This opens up the possibility that Azstarys won’t just be competing for market share on the Methylphenidate side but may be able to cross over to the Amphetamine side and capture market share directly from Vyvanse.**

And while I don’t assume that its performance will be equivalent to Vyvanse, it is impossible to ignore the potent combination of product and people at play. **Corium’s recruitment of the former Shire team has given Azstarys the best possible chance to succeed. Who better to have on your product's side than the very same people that made Vyvanse the leading ADHD medication in the business.**

And as a final anecdote, I have already spoken to my doctor about Azstarys and we both agree that it will be my next medication. Not because I believe in the company or want to help with sales. But because I've tried just about every medication on the market and want the best treatment possible. **And Azstarys just seems better.**

So that just leaves one last question: can KemPharm continue to innovate?

The answer… **Travis Mickle.**

While there is no data in the world that can anticipate the future actions of any one person, I have a gut feeling that there might just be some magic left in the old Mickster. I’ll end this overly long DD with a simple quote and leave it to you to decide for yourself:

>“It is akin to the Golden Goose that will just keep laying golden egg after golden egg. Dr. Mickle has stated that ‘given sufficient funds, he doesn’t have enough life left, to develop all of the possibilities.’ This is perhaps the most valuable asset that KemPharm possesses.","['NDAQ', 'BLL', 'GPC', 'MMM']"

I started to learn about investing a few years ago.mostly about YouTube. Over the last year I also picked up some books. A mix of Jack Bogle, day trading and a few to value companies on fundamental basis. 
That’s all fine and it makes sense to me , will try to invest as much as I can in safe assets like msci world or sp500 .
Especially the whole gme debacle showed me that I don’t want to trust a random guy on YouTube or Reddit about stocks. I can do my own work now and check it his statements make sense, but I feel like I’m missing something about finding good stocks. 
Maybe there isn’t even a way and it’s all luck, i don’t know so I want to ask here.I’m not talking about gme like stocks here. But anything that’s at a potential to gain more than 9 percent a year. 
How do you find such stocks? Are there people consistent at finding them? 
Are there good books or sources? If I try to look for sources about this all I get are YouTube gurus telling me why I need to buy their book.
I just want some source that has some kind of seriousness to it, if there are any.I’m willing to learn, it does not need to be fast or anything.but I always feel like I’m hearing about it a stock or industry after its already inflated. 
If anyone had this question and found anything that helped him answer it, I’d greatly appreciate it.

Now there aren't enough workers to replace older populations soon to retire, so Japan's GDP continues to fight to stay in the top 3)

It's mainly due to cultural reasons that Japan's economy ended up like that. Americans are too opportunistic to run into the same issue. If the stock market does collapse, it would be for different reasons than Japan.",

With that being said, I’m putting around $2500 in market a month through 403b and ROTH. So far I’ve saved $61000 in ~1.75 years and today I just put $10000 into MercadoLibre. 

To me: 
- revenues increasing
- advantage to Amazon due to superior infrastructure navigation in South America
- fintech in Mercadopago that operates sort of like a credit card in a way. 
- eCommerce is growing in general and Brazil is growing rapidly economy wise. 

With all these things, I want to hear why people don’t want to invest in MercadoLibre as I want to fine tune my pessimism towards it. Has anyone been burned, or noticed anything in their research. Any and all feedback is welcome.

Here we have a payment method called boleto bancário that people use often and it's not available in the local branch of Amazon, and personally I think the site is pretty shitty, so I don't see Amazon taking over here soon. It seems like they are not even making an effort, but maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, this is a point for ML.

BUT our economy is in shambles. It will get better after the COVID restrictions are lifted, for sure, but as long as Bolsonaro is in power we are doomed to get worse. It's his third year, first term, and he has a reasonable chance of getting reelected. The highly educated and talented people are moving to better countries. There are no jobs for the young people. Sooo there's that.

At least I could say that I mostly use ML for imported products, and the lack of local options due to the economic crisis kind of helps that. So maybe it's possible to profit from our downfall. Not a experienced investor here, just an average citizen, so take all of this with a grain of salt.

mwegir,,stocks,post,1619124579,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 22, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 22, 2021**

Stocks fell on Thursday, erasing yesterday’s gains as market volatility continues. Stocks fell after Bloomberg reported that President Biden would propose increasing the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.91% down, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.94% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.21%.

According to a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy), President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. 

Corporate earnings have so far exceeded Wall Street’s even lofty expectations, as companies benefited from both a surge in consumer spending as the economy opens back up and cost-cutting measures implemented during the height of the pandemic.  However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies, in our opinion.

Jim Caron, investment management fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (MS) said, “What we have is the absence of a catalyst. Everything that we’ve done over the last twelve months has been to build up to this point, to get this recovery, to get a very, very strong second-quarter GDP, which we think could be upwards of 10%. But after that, things start to slow down. It doesn’t mean that the data gets bad, it just means on a relative basis that the third quarter will be weaker than the second quarter and the fourth quarter may be weaker than the third quarter.”

**Highlights**

* Two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.
* Square (SQ) announced that it plans to make new inventory-management features available to its sellers.The company is rolling out tools that help sellers automate their inventory-management processes by using barcode scanners to take stock of inventory and receiving alerts driven by machine learning to see when an item is due to run out.
* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.
* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).

I'm trying to invest in the future of my nephew and niece. They're both 2 years old and I want to be able to set up a college fund of sorts for them. I'm 27 and will be rid of student loans in the next couple of months. I can comfortably set aside $350-400 each month for this purpose and I plan to do so for as long as I am able to. I myself am new and don't have a lot invested but would like to start early on their behalf. 

What is the best strategy I could go for. I plan to cost average on a monthly basis. Should I go for standard ETFs like SPY, VTI or growth/tech like TSLA, AAPL, MSFT or maybe take the dividend route with O, T, SCHD, SPYD etc. ( I have very limited knowledge) 

I am pretty new to this whole scene (<3 months in) but I'd like to get something setup for them. Any tips would be helpful. Am I doing this too early? What factors should I consider? Should I setup a good portfolio myself and then focus on theirs? 

The other option I have is setup a govt controlled savings scheme in my home country. I can invest a max of around 2000$ every year in their account = 4000$ total. This savings will grow at <6% each year and will compound itself and is tax free during withdrawal (after 15 years+) . But I doubt it will beat the S&P 500 over a 15-20 year period considering inflation of my home currency and the interest rate is bound to change at any time. So I'd much rather have the investment in USD.

mxaojd,,investing,post,1619230712,"The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail InvestorEDIT: I added the [MacroVoices podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDIifbY71g) where Chris Cole goes over the Dragon Portfolio. I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&P 500. This tends to outperform the S&P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.","['SPGI', 'LEG']"

mwvqvk,,investing,post,1619185962,"Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunityLeave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",

mwo3ha,,investing,post,1619155271,"Some advice from a regular dude that will hopefully make you more money...Are you making stock purchases based on opinions from analysts, CNBC, stock pickers, and everything in between?

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

mx1aby,,investing,post,1619201124,"My Alteryx (AYX) DD: This isn't a dip to buy, it's part of their long decline.After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to [instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664513-alteryx-shares-drop-after-chief-revenue-officer-resigns).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, [an analyst](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/alteryx-s-1-breakdown-4a711683f6c) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares.","['NDAQ', 'MMM']"

3. Adding an Alteryx copycat to the O365 family with out-of-the-box connectivity to all the other O365 services seems like a huge perk. Seamless integration between Excel, One Drive, Power BI, and Active Directory sounds super nice to me.

Anecdotally, I'm Alteryx Core certified and fluent in M and python. A lot of times for data transformation I'll go with power query just because the native Excel integration makes it quick and easy. For more advanced jobs I'll go to python for the flexibility. The only standout thing about Alteryx to me is its user friendliness which I think Microsoft is more than capable of matching at some point.","['MS', 'MSFT']"

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive. 

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price. 

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of  growth figures is required to get great returns.",['GOOGL']

mx7aye,,investing,post,1619218741,"Ideas for investing in growth in the sunbeltThe southern US is growing much faster than the rest of the US, especially places like the Phoenix MSA and Texas Triangle. Of the top 10 most populous cities in the US, the only four that have experienced more than 10% population growth in the past decade have been in Texas and Arizona. Austin in particular (#11th most populous US city) grew 24% in the past decade and is probably the hottest real estate market in the US right now. Anyone who lives in these areas, especially Texas, knows how how many people from places like California are going to Texas for cheaper CoL amongst other things. I'd provide links but I'm not sure if they'd get my post deleted by AutoMod - city/state growth is readily available.

That being said, real estate is the most obvious investment opportunity to profit off of this demographic shift. My only exposure to real estate as a 25 year old just starting my career is FundRise and REITs - FundRise has a clear focus on southern real estate, especially in TX, and with enough research you can find REITs (like MAA, CPT, BRT) that invest primarily in the sunbelt region.

Other ideas I've had are power/utilities companies like PNW. One might even combine this demographic perspective with climate change speculation - people are moving to hot places that are going to keep getting hotter; air conditioning stocks like CARR may be a good choice?

So form my perspective, I can only really think REITs/utilities/AC. I wanted to give my own two cents on how to profit off of this growth but also see if people here had other ideas as to specific sectors or stocks (or non-stock market ideas) and spark discussion. I'm also curious if people here have ideas for investing in other demographic trends such as aging population.","['MAA', 'CARR', 'PNW']"

I have been using their product Omnipod for the past decade or so. As far as I'm aware, it is the only insulin pump that is wireless. At this current moment, there are other insulin pumps include additional features like integration with continuous glucose monitors, Omnipod has partnered with Tidepool, a nonprofit that has created an automated insulin dosing application (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005324/en/Tidepool-Completes-FDA-510-k-Submission-of-Tidepool-Loop).

This is a HUGE deal for type 1 diabetics (apart from Tandem's t:slim X2 which currently has a feature BasalIQ but this has tubing so not wireless (https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/providers/products/basal-iq)). Having your insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor communicate and automatically adjust is heading towards the direction of creating an 'artificial pancreas' and makes managing diabetes so much better. I think that having the 'wireless' feature will put them at an advantage when an eventual 'combination' insulin pump/continuous glucose monitor hits the market.",

That means the pump system is paired with a continuous blood glucose monitor which provides real time blood sugar read outs and real time insulin delivery. 

This is a big deal as the current Loop system is skunkworks project which works great but is not mainstream. 

Tl;dr.  Omnipod is on the cusp of being part of a truly FDA approved artificial pancreas system and their tech is the only one that is entirely wireless (no tubes).

mwx0rd,,investing,post,1619189538,"Enbridge: Critical Infrastructure in the Green RevolutionThe green revolution is upon us. Enbridge is a critical energy infrastructure business known for transporting oil and natural gas. It also has a sizeable renewable segment. What you might not be aware of is how well that stacks up in the renewables space and how such companies are including non-renewable power in their total outputs.

For capacity context, the International Renewable Energy Agency released its [2020 Renewable Capacity Statistics ](https://www.irena.org/publications/2021/March/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2021)which provides insights into the sector as a whole.

 I have ranked Enbridge with various renewable companies in terms of **current net capacity** (the maximum output of electricity a generator can produce under ideal conditions) **minus natural gas capacity,** which[ according to the International Renewable Energy Agency is an alternative fossil fuel. ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Apr/IRENA_Report_GET_2018.pdf)Definitions for what constitute *renewable* natural gas vary and you will see further examples below, but this number is included where available. The only outputs considered are strictly renewable: solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. I have not included energy generation statistics (how much energy is actually output) because this varies based on operating capacity and conditions (eg. weather events will lower output).  


All data has been sourced from the latest publicly available ESG or Annual Reports and provided below. 

 

|**Company**|**Net Renewable Capacity (MW)**|
|:-|:-|
|Brookfield Renewable|18,884|
|Innergex Renewable|2,742|
|Boralex|2,455|
|Enbridge|1,727|
|Algonquin|1,456|
|Northland Power|1,323|
|Transalta Renewables|1,619\*\*|

\*\* \*\*Transalta Renewables as at Dec 31 2020 listed only gross renewable MW and not net, which is significantly lower. 

&#x200B;

 **Brookfield Renewable:** by far the largest output capacity and zero natural gas facilities. The majority of net capacity comes from Hydro and Wind. 

 **Innergex Renewable:** The majority of net capacity comes from Wind and Hydro. Again no natural gas. 

 **Boralex:** 82% of net capacity is derived from Wind. Least diversified of the group. 

 **Enbridge:** Majority of renewable capacity generated by Wind. Renewables represent 3% of EBITDA and appx. $200MM in annual contracted revenues. 

 Combined Current Renewable Power Generation outputs:  
• 1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;  
• 255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;  
• 80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation 

 **Algonquin**: The latest data from 2021 sources showed FY19 figures. You will see coal listed here: the Asbury coal plant was closed in March 2020. Furthermore, a significant portion of their capacity is from natural gas (50%), which is from non-renewable sources and thus not included. 

 **Northland Power:** Included in their total output is ‘efficient’ natural gas, which accounts for \~60% of net capacity. While the outcome is reduced emissions, it is still not a renewable source and therefore not included in total renewable capacity. 

 **Transalta Renewables:** Similar to Algonquin and Northland, a significant portion of capacity is from natural gas (\~60%). I was unable to find updated net capacity statistics, which are significantly lower than gross, thus TA ranked last. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net capacity is an important metric in measuring where a renewable company stands, but it is not the only one. Revenues are impacted by total output and pricing, of which the weather events in Texas provided an eye-opening example. Nevertheless, what we see from the above comparison is that Enbridge is already well positioned amongst common North American “renewable” names, albeit far behind big players like Brookfield. Looking through the above company ESG and Annual Reports highlighted further forays into traditional renewable sources, while also noting investments in **renewable natural gas**. Let’s not forget the critical role Enbridge will play in RNG transmission alongside their [own RNG production.](https://www.enbridgegas.com/Natural-Gas-and-the-Environment/Enbridge-A-Green-Future/Renewable-Natural-Gas) 

 Make of this information what you will. The market is currently discounting their business with the secular oil decline, and not fully considering Enbridge’s ability to innovate and partner alongside a growing global energy infrastructure network, particularly in the NG/RNG space. I am bullish.

They also own a large amount of infrastructure assets, such as natural gas pipelines, which RNG companies can use to distribute their products (gotta heat my home whether it NG or RNG). In the current environment (hard to build new pipelines) these assets become more valuable. They also become more valuable since asset prices are going up due to the current low rate environment and stimulus.

mw4jei,,investing,post,1619097477,"PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendationsFor those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

Stock futures are a bit higher, with small caps leading the major indices. Russell 2000 is up 0.6%. Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all up about 0.2%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a day of selling in reaction to President Biden’s “American Family Plan,” which is to be funded mainly by increasing the capital gains tax and the top income tax rate. Predictably, markets don’t like this plan very much.

It may not be relevant because it probably has little chance of passing through Congress. Too many Democrat senators are probably beholden to the financial sector for this to happen. And you only need one defection to kill it. More likely it will be watered down significantly. And even then it won’t affect most retail traders. The rich, meanwhile, will find loopholes. They always do.

So this is likely another market overreaction to news. It overshadows a day of mostly positive earnings results, though not from airlines (American and Southwest both fell short of estimates and their stocks sold off. They are rebounding in the premarket however).

Couple of earnings on tap today, led by American Express, Honeywell, and Kimberly Clark.

Still say things are set up pretty well for stocks to move higher, but you shouldn’t listen to me on that.","['AXP', 'NDAQ', 'DOW', 'SPGI']"

32, turning 33 in July. United States. 

>Are you employed/making income? How much?

Unemployed, but unemployment is giving me 15/hr in a 40 hour equivalent period. 

>What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)

Retirement and make extra money. 

>What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

I want to retire at 65. About 32 years.

70% safe.

Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?

No debts or expenses. I currently have 15K in my savings account and 3K in my checking accounts. 


Yes, I just started a IRA Roth with fidelity. I currently put 1000 dollars in the 2020 year on a target date fund 2050 (FIPFX).

> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


>He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said.","['TWTR', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'FB']"

As long as there is more liquidity moving into indices than moving out they will continue to benefit. But they will continue to increase in valuation as there is more demand and at some point those valuations will be a drag on future returns if the business performance can’t keep up. 

Think of tobacco stocks having the opposite effect. Nobody wants to own them anymore so their multiples have collapsed and are likely to be perpetually “cheap”.

mvwh0z,,investing,post,1619062572,"Reconciling the Intelligent Investor with Current Bond yields.Ok, I’ve just finished The Intelligent Investor for the first time. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with investing as Graham defines it (as opposed to speculating) and the current situation with bond yields with his advice that you should keep at least 25% allocated because of the potential for things to change in the future. 

I’ve also been a fan of Ray Dalio’s advice, and recently read his post on avoiding bonds altogether.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio)

These two thought streams are seemingly at odds, and the best I can come up with is that Graham’s advice didn’t take into account such low bond yields ever existing, and I’m probably better off following Dalio’s advice:

“ I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.”

I’ve gotten rid of bond ETFs completely from my portfolio, and now have some gold, emerging Asia markets, commodities, foreign value ETFs to replace them.

mvwh0z,gverj56,investing,comment,1619065603,The point of investing in bonds is to give you something stable to sell if/when stocks crash. They are not a driver of portfolio returns. Dalio doesn’t need to do this because the “short cash” he mentions is code for use leverage aka just borrow to buy more stocks when needed.,
mvwh0z,gvf62wg,investing,comment,1619077366,"Graham says keep at least 25% in bonds, Dalio says avoid bonds altogether.... yes it is a fair conclusion that these thought streams are at odds.  Although not entirely. They both have their own idea of what is a stable ""safe haven"" to keep some investment in a position that is quickly and easily made liquid. That's where you have to make your own decision... What do you think is a safe haven place to park your cash where on a rainy day you can liquidate... That could be bonds, gold, apple.

Reality is all of them, and none of them.",['AAPL']
mvwh0z,gveuvqj,investing,comment,1619067991,"Be very careful reading into what’s going.  In general people epic fail at complex systems.  No one predicted the large number of retail investors joining the market due to Covid nor gamblers switching to the stock market.  Most of what is getting publish is cherry picking data to prove their point.  Very few go out of the way to try to get a basic understanding and will recognize that all the data isn’t available publicly.  It is also a very complex system so trying to make short term predictions is hard because there are simply to many variables.  So you can say what is happening right now will not last forever due to simple mathematical properties but when will the market catch up to reality who knows.  When it goes it will not be for one reason, there will be multiple complex interactions just like 2008.

If bonds are a bad investment because interest rates are too low then why are the largest players buying them?  Means the have other uses besides getting the return.  What happens if bond yields go up any significant amount?  Well the world is in a debt bubble so when companies try to refinance they won’t be able too.  So they default and assets are sold to cover their debt.  Then you have to go a step further and ask what does that mean?  When this occurs money is destroyed and liquidity in the system is smaller since the thing lending the money didn’t get made whole.

Then you have another fact when interest rates go down the bond is worth more.  So even though most bonds are paying very little interest the note itself has been appreciating in value.  Since bonds can’t really go down much more they will stop appreciating in value.  For the last 40 years people have been told to move to bonds in retirement.  Most projections for pension funds and 401k is to earn 6 to 7%.  With an aging population there simply won’t be enough people to sustain even that.  Would need to grow the economy through actual production not asset speculation.

There isn’t going to be inflation in consumer goods long term because you have to have an increase in wages with relatively the same production.  The other thing you can get inflation is through supply shocks which are usually temporary.  The goods going up in price now are due to speculation(lumber) and supply shocks.  Most of the money being created goes to asset purchases which inflates asset price.  So far all debt driven bubbles for asset purchases have popped.  The more debt you put into the system the bigger the pop.  No one knows when it will pop but no assets will be safe when it does because people will have to sell high quality assets to cover for loses in low quality.  This is why buffet has a large cash pile because he can go in and buy the high quality assets at a discount.",
mve8vh,,investing,post,1619006842,"Netflix Misses Q1 Subscriber Targets, Blaming Covid-19 Issues, But Beats Financial ForecastsNetflix reported 208 million global subscribers as of the end of the first quarter, missing its own prediction for 210 million.


The streaming giant did beat financial targets, though with earnings per share of $3.75 coming in well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ expectations. Revenue of $7.16 billion also topped the Street.


The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

Jaguar Land Rover is to temporarily shut down production at two of its main UK factories because of a shortage of computer chips, in the latest sign of the difficulties facing the global car industry during the pandemic.

It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date.

The automotive industry is used to running lean “just-in-time” supply chains that minimise the amount of cash tied up in factory warehouses. However, the global nature of the chip shortage has strained carmakers as they compete directly with tech companies for supply.

Manufacturing will continue at JLR’s Solihull plant. JLR’s international factories in Slovakia, Brazil and China are as yet unaffected.",

mvoso0,,investing,post,1619037311,"$KARO - Comprehensive DD - Recent IPO - Exec Summary**Exec Summary for those that want a TL:DR**

Firstly - I am an existing shareholder, own around 900 shares with an average buy price of $34 (so I am down on this... but in the current market, who isn't). KARO are a leading global provider of vehicle telematics. The proprietary in-house technology provides the best intelligent, actionable data to fleet operators and security for all vehicle owners - across 23 countries over 5 continents. Most interesting areas of the business to me are their AI Video & Fleet Telematics, along with how they use their data to sell used cars and insurance in the future. I am impressed that they seem to keep developing the business, whilst maintaining a very healthy 15% margin.

* KARO is a holding company, the actual company is Cartrack
* 1.3m subscribers with 50 billion data points each month - data provides KARO with a huge opportunity for growth
* Business has continued strong growth through Covid (16% compared to 22% CAGR previously), expected rate is 26% for future years
* Free cash flow around 25%
* Prior to delisting from JSE, to list on NASDAQ and then do an inwards investment back onto the JSE - the stock price hit $629, with a share consolidation taking place at 10:1 - giving at all time high of $62.90 per share. Typically South African investment is more conservative that US/EU investors - who are more accepting of potential earnings forming part of the share price.
* Price to earnings is 28x - which is low in their industry, with the average being around 53x

**Products & Services**

What does KARO currently offer?

B2B - known as 'My Fleet' - Live Vision to make sure the driver is concentrating and not on their phone, insurance telematics, fleet management and optimisation, stolen vehicle recovery and fleet administration services. All services typically outsourced, not many companies I know of will invest in developing this tech themselves which is good for Karo.

B2C - known as 'My Car' - Vehicle protector, stolen vehicle recover (with promise to customer), crash alert to emergency services and insurance telematics.

**Customer Profile**

**South Africa -** De Beers, MAN, Avis, SA Taxi, Super Sport, Hino and many more - company originates from SA and very strong YOY performance here.

**Rest of Africa** \- Toyota, Cat, Moove and NCBA

**Europe** \- LaFarge, Telefurgo, Green Galaxy and Sonae MC

**Asia** \- Singapore Prison Service, ORIX, Grab Rentals & Asia Brewery

Lots more to list - company has accounts open in the UK and US - with very small amounts of trade at the moment, but they have a track record of aggressive expansion whilst maintaining margins.

**Financials (Converted from ZAR to USD... took a while, so apologies if you spot any errors)**

Without doubt my favourite part of this company, extremely strong performer and growth looks very positive, with sufficient results to back up projections.

Low Debt - $1.2m

Total Cash - $7m

Free Cash Flow Margin - 25%

Total Assets - $140m

Total Liabilities - $56m

Debt Coverage - Well covered by operating cash flow (2019%)

Gross Margin - 71%

Revenue - $167m (c.4.5x market cap)

Earnings - $27.7m (roughly 15% margin & 28x market cap - industry average listed on Nasdaq is c.50x)

I will post a link to their IPO pack in the comments section - I have looked at the financials over and over, **I really struggle to see any negatives but if you find any, please can you leave a comment as I want to keep educating myself.**

**Bull Case - Top 4 Points**

Aggressive, rapid and consistent CAGR - in the 20% range. I absolutely love this, I know I'm down right now but my price target to exit this stock is around $45 as a low estimate. Even with the market performing badly, I am not worried about my investment here. It isn't speculative, they are delivering.

Big data - its been big for a long time, I'm convinced it will continue to be big in the future. They already generate 50 billion data points a month from their existing contracts. They are looking to get further integrated with the insurance market and second hand car sales. Knowing how people drive through their current offerings is going to be huge in selling products that instantly fit with the consumers goals. If they drive fast... maybe upsell the car and have an insurance package wrapped up to help seal the deal. If they are more conservative drivers but have a powerful car, sell something more appropriate. I think this is a major opportunity for the business.

The world is going to see more crime, insurance premiums are rising, people want more protection and Karo offer a service that fills this space. Yes, there is telematics competition but in the nicest possible way car theft in the regions they currently operate in is pretty high and in regions that they don't yet operate in. Factor this alongside how much crime will increase in a post covid world (due to poverty increasing), I think that their CAGR of 26% will be achieved. Rich get richer... poor get poorer etc, its sad but generally true. Those with money will want to protect their valued assets without risking their own personal wellbeing.

Businesses need what Karo are selling. Whether its AI controlled systems or human, fleet management want 99% plus optimisation, with Karo's growth and products on offer, they simply must be offering a high quality product. Live vision & fleet tracking is something I can see growing more and more. I know from personal experience of having to deal with a particularly painful Brexit, this would have been a life saver had all the fleet been managed in this way and could be traced at a click of a button. Integrated supply chains rely on this real time data, which to my disbelief doesn't currently exist throughout the world. Note - biggest single customer represents less than 2% revenue, so they are heavily diversified.

**Bear Case - Top 4 Points**

No major contracts in USA, Germany, France or UK. I don't know why, maybe it isn't in their strategy right now, but I'd really like to see them get a big contract in one of these regions. I'm sure it will come but it isn't there right now and although they may well do well in China - the markets I mention are strong and relatively stable compared to South Africa and current countries that they operate in.

Volume - its pretty low, the good news is... its a buyers market - the spreads aren't great, so would only enter with a limit order if you did decide to invest, be patient and I'd say no real need to click the ask button right now.

Competition - there is clear competition in the telematics industry, I'm not even going to try and counter this as its a basic fact. I have based my investment on the numbers I see in their investor pack, only you can decide whether these numbers are suitable for your investment and offer competitive value against other investment opportunities.

The number of risks listed in their SEC prospectus filing was pretty crazy - my positive spin on this is that they are aware of their risks, honest about them and have strategies to counter/mitigate against them. I'll post the link so you can check this out too, but please do before making a decision on whether to invest.

**Share Structure**

Relatively simple section - NASDAQ is the priority listing, total of c.21,000,000 shares - 20,000,000 held by insiders with a 180 day lock up. 9,000,000 listed on the JSE as in inwards listing.

Cartrack (KARO) used to be listed solely on the JSE - but due to expansion plans, has now listed on Nasdaq... it was listed the same day as UTME and genuinely believe a lot of investors missed this IPO due to the hype and price increase on UTME.

The company was previously valued at over $1 billion on the JSE and the CEO didn't sell any shares, as he went on record to say that he felt the company was worth at least $1.5 billion.

**Key Catalysts**

Earnings are due soon - I have spoken to their Investor Relations team and expected first week of May. I'm expecting that these are positive.

Covid risk lowering, more people returning to normal - cars left unattended in public places, more travel, more collisions, insurance going up and people using telematics to help reduce the total cost of car ownership.

The CEO has previously discussed how he believes cars will not be owned by individuals in the future and more fleet management will be required to make sure those in charge of a vehicle are driving responsibly. A lot depends on whether you share the same vision.

mutq93,,investing,post,1618934752,"Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's handNew York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

mw7vx7,,investing,post,1619106938,"General Partner at Initialized Capital Alda Leu Dennis speaks on investing advice from Garry Tan, why VC funding is gender-biased, and why funding for women-led startups fell during the pandemic.While male founders have consistently gotten more VC funding, the pandemic wasn’t kind to women-led startups, who received even less money from VCs in 2020. Alda Leu Dennis, a general partner at Initialized Capital, says it’s in part because of the lack of women VCs. 

In 2020, VC funding for all-female founding teams fell to 2.4%, a drop from the all-time high of 3.4% the year before, according to Crunchbase. Dennis, meanwhile, is investing in startups that could narrow the gender gap, many of which are FamTech (family tech) companies, designed to improve family life — something many of us have gotten plenty of during lockdown.

Before Initialized, Dennis was a managing partner at 137 Ventures, investing in startups like Wish, Coupang, and CourseHero. She broke into venture capital by way of law (with a stint as a CEO), serving as general counsel at Founders Fund, and assistant general counsel at Clarium Capital Management, working with Peter Thiel.

Bidding war begins as Canadian National jumps in with $34B offer for Kansas City Southern ($KSU)After last month's big news of [Canadian Pacific's ~$25B acquisition of Kansas City Southern](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma15h0/major_railroad_merger_canadian_pacific_is_buying/), a spanner has been thrown into the works as competitor Canadian National has come in with a better bid. Canadian National came out with the [details of the offer today](https://www.cn.ca/en/news/2021/04/cn-makes-superior-proposal-to-combine-with-kansas-city-southern/), which include $200 cash and 1.059 $CNI shares for each $KSU share, valuing $KSU at just about $325 as of market open. (This compares to CP's previous offer of $90 and .489 CP shares or about $275 for each $KSU share at time of offer.)

This new bid sets up a big potential struggle for the last major railroad outside the big 6. KCS would have to pay a $700M breakup fee to CP in order to accept another deal, but the offer from CN is significantly better. Both deals would still be subject to STB approval, which is uncertain, and CN may have an even harder time getting approval given some overlap with the existing KCS network.

Canadian Pacific has already [fired back in a statement](https://www.railwayage.com/freight/cn-counters-cpkc-with-a-superior-proposal/?RAchannel=regulatory):

> “CN’s proposal is massively complex and likely to fail,” CP said, guns blazing in a press release issued late on April 20. “[It] would create the third-largest Class I railroad [after UP and BNSF] and destabilize the competitive balance in the North American rail industry. The only combination involving KCS that is clearly in the public interest is the one that Canadian Pacific has proposed, which has already garnered support from more than 400 shippers and other stakeholders. While remaining the smallest of the six U.S. Class I railroads by revenue, a combination [of] CP and KCS creates stronger single-line competition against existing Class I routes.

KCS shareholders are likely feeling like the belle of the ball with multiple bidders now in the mix and the lurking potential of a bid from Union Pacific or even Berkshire Hathaway (BNSF). At minimum CP would likely have to improve their offer in order to see it accepted. $KSU was up 15% to $295.50 at the end of today's trading.","['BLL', 'UNP', 'KSU', 'BRK.B']"

muxxha,,investing,post,1618945936,"I think Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and ArchegosTo understand what’s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill’s insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I’m guessing it’s directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don’t have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I’ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse’s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don’t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won’t be pretty either way.

Now let’s talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don’t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos’s TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn’t justify the hit Credit Suisse’s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash – they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn’t have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn’t enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I’m confident I’m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. There are too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to act as a catalyst for more bad news, and the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market’s behavior over the past several days, I think it’s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I’m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss’s interaction with Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS’s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I’m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.

Edit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I won't tell you what to think, but I do want to give my personal thoughts. I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of ""adjusted"" and ""excluding significant items"" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a ton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term. This is a play that I believe will likely take several years to pay off.","['MS', 'VIAC', 'GS', 'DISCA']"

• Group revenues of AED 41.2 billion, 6% lower than the prior-year  period, primarily due to lower commodity prices and production volumes  within the Oil & Gas segment. • EBITDA was AED 16.0 billion, down 13%, reflecting lower revenues that were partially offset by lower expenses.  
• Net income (TAQA-share) decreased to AED 2.8 billion, which reflected a  significantly lower contribution from the Oil & Gas segment that  was impacted by a AED 1.5 billion post-tax impairment charge taken in Q1  2020.  
• Capital expenditure was AED 4.0 billion, a decrease of 19% primarily due to lower spending in the Oil & Gas segment.

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",

mu1z70,gv3e37x,investing,comment,1618847585,"Nice fundamentals.   I think COIN is probably the most compelling IPO of 2021 and the stock price could double more easily than a lot of other tickers out there.     

One question is how the stock will contend with the approval of a BTC ETF, if this occurs.   Right now, many COIN buyers want exposure to the crypto sector, but with the investor protections of a publicly traded equity.  A natural place for it is in a Roth IRA.   But, if a BTC ETF is approved (and that's a big if) wouldn't you rather have that instead?

An attractive feature of COIN's ""we sell shovels in this gold rush"" investment thesis is that buying it means you don't have to pick a winner in the crypto boom.  If BTC ends up #1, you make money, but you also make money if it's ETH, or if it's one of the touted Ethereum killers (if a coin they don't have like Solana really takes off, they will add it).

mu39cq,,investing,post,1618846536,"SPAR Group (SGRP), Smal Cap stock, Full DDHello guys, i am searching for undervalued small cap stocks to invest in for myself and think that  can share this researches with you. Maybe someone will find it usefull and i will find some new information here.  Also English its not my native language, sorry in advance for some mistakes. 

  
SPAR Group is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more. Its from their 10K.  


I screen stocks for their fundamentals and then, if i see something interesting there, iam going deeper.

**Lets see their multiples first:**

\- P/E 10,4x

\- P/B 1,1x

\- ROIC 26%

\- Net debt (- 2,7 mln $) ( they have more cash in their balance than debt).

\- Total debt/ CFO( cash flow from operations) = 1,5x. 

They have really good fundamentals and strong balance sheet. Also positive FCFF ( free cash flow to the firm).  

Their revenue  for 2020 was 230,5 mln $( 252,8 mln $ in 2019, - 9% YOY Growth). It consist of two majore sources. Revenue in United states was 92,1 mln $, International revenue 138,4 mln $.

  


| Net international revenue: | **2020** | YOY Growth |2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Brazil| **49,940**|\-24%| 65,942|
|South Africa | **28,235** |4%| 27,201 |
|Mexico | **22,679**|\-3%| 23,324|
|China | **12,401** |\-5%| 12,993 |
|Japan | **9,273**|\-19%| 11,469 |
|India | **8,589**  |\-3%| 8,813   |
|Canada | **6,294** |\-31%| 9,059  |
|Australia | **988**  |\-68%| 3,087|
|Turkey|**-**|\-100%| 268  |
|Total international revenue|**138,399 (59,9% of revenue)**|\-15%| 162,156  (64,1% of revenue)|

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what.",

mtjvlt,,investing,post,1618774981,"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

mt2tfk,,investing,post,1618706696,"Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense InvestingI wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often.",['SPGI']

I specifically invest in those because they give exposure to the world, instead of ETFs with a focus on the US, like VTI and VOO.

Or so I thought...

[VT has a market allocation of 57.1% to US and only 4.5% to China.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vt)

[To adjust for this you can buy an ETF with a focus on China, e.g. VWO.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo)

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

[Sources and calculation can be found in this sheet.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5yv6O6-S6IHhiGF0OAySZ6_WTO1SL1U/view)

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

In case that isn't clear enough, I would assume that the average revenue exposure of European public companies to China is >15%. I would assume >10% for US. Those revenues contribute to China GDP.

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this). If you then want to take the additional step of being overweight China equities broadly, something like VWO doesn't sound crazy.  And that step is an interesting debatable topic.",
msaeih,,investing,post,1618600826,"Next week, the US cannabis industry is nearing its first major federal legislation milestone of the year. SAFE Act[**Marijuana Banking Bill Expected To Get A House Floor Vote Next Week, Sponsor’s Office Says**](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-banking-bill-expected-to-get-a-house-floor-vote-next-week-sponsors-office-says/)

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",['ED']

msaeih,gusgny2,investing,comment,1618620995,"I'm heavy in US Cannabis and my heaviest position is in Cresco. Just want to drop a little fundamental analysis here for you guys and expand on SAFE further. 

Bullish Arguments First: 

Currently, the Big 4 MSO's that you mentioned above are trading at a P/S ratio of near or about 7. Meaning their market caps are about 7x their 2020 Revenues. Cresco, specifically, is 6.88 P/S. To compare, CGC and APHA have a P/S of 26 and 9, respectively. MNST is a Consumer Packaged Good [CPG] that trades at about 11 P/S, although that's not a perfect comparison. I consider Cannabis a mix between Agriculture and CPG, so I chose MNST for a comparison with a more mature growth company. Now, a P/S near 7 isn't that crazy of a discount, since that's what more mature growth companies are trading near. However, that's not considering the exponential growth that each state brings in terms of sales. Each state has a TAM boost of maybe near 1-2 Billion. Each MSO had Year over Year growths of over 100% in sales. And the estimates for 2021 and 2022 remain over 100%. For example, Cresco has a 2022 estimated P/S of **2.5**. Meaning the stock price should 3-4 x to catch up to the 2022 P/S expectation. The estimates are fairly conservative, because they don't consider that the MSO's could potentially reach scale in NJ, NY, and other states that just legalized recreational cannabis. They also aren't fully considering the acquisitions being made and how they could boost revenues and the increased demand in states like Illinois (Did you see those sales numbers?! March had the highest sales OF ALL TIME). 

Talking about acquisitions, it helps lead me into my next point. The MSO's have been incredibly successful, but they've essentially had one arm tied behind their backs. They are forced to trade in Canadian markets and over the counter so their equity raises for acquisitions are heavily handicapped. They are also taxed heavy because Cannabis is linked to Section 280E. Not to mention, they don't even have access to banking yet, which is what SAFE will help with. Literally, they have cash block rooms for the IRS to collect taxes. There are a fair amount of headwinds they are running into, but they are still growing an incredible amount; not to mention that all the Big 4 are already generating positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of the Section 280 and federal handicaps they run up against.  None of the big Canadian players are generating positive EBITDA yet, for comparison, and they don't have to worry about the same federal headwinds. The problem, in my opinion, with the Canadians is Canada is one country, with population roughly equal to CA or TX, but with the entire US's worth of competition; there's also no limit on supply of Cannabis. Basic supply and demand, but more supply, less pricing power and lower the margins. The US limits licenses for legalized states so supply is topped. Illinois has the best blueprint, in my opinion, and they are being called the Silicon Valley of Weed. Just SAFE passing and getting off of [280E](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-irs-tries-to-collect-taxes-from-marijuana-companies-through-280e/) will create a massive earnings gap fill (earnings will legit near double). 

[Now what does SAFE do for us?](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/would-safe-banking-allow-msos-to-uplist-onto-major-u-s-exchanges-the-experts-weigh-in/) We already know it will pass House next week. We just need the 10 votes in Senate. There are a lot of different viewpoints on SAFE, but the most bullish is if it can help sway the US exchanges to allow for uplisting. Uplisting is the #1 catalyst we should look out for. This opens the door for institutions, ETF's, other fundies, even robinhooders to buy the stock. Right now I think most of them are buying the Canadians instead, which don't have real growth prospects in the US. They can't enter the US THC market and remain listed because it's illegal federally. So while they are doing their thing in Canada, the US MSO's are growing and scaling in key states. When it's federally legal, Canadians might try to enter, but they won't have the time or the equity to scale and compete. It sucks because they had to learn all the lessons the hard way, and now, the US names learned from their mistakes AND they get to keep the Canadians out while they grow and reach scale. It's actually quite fortunate for them the way it worked out. If Cannabis was legalized federally too quickly, the Canadians could have just used their sheer market cap to bully and acquire the US MSO's. 

I can go on all night, but I've spent a fair amount of time writing this up already. Let's briefly discuss the bearish viewpoints.

1) Congress. They could hold up legislation for Cannabis. Although SAFE is one that we should expect in 2021, decriminalization and federal legalization will take time. SAFE doesn't guarantee uplisting, but helps the % chance it can happen in 2021. Today there was news of a federal Bill that allows Veterans to carry legal medical Cannabis across illegal state lines. That's a pretty good start, if it can pass. 

2) Margin compressions. As the market for US Cannabis matures, companies will experience margin compression. Especially as more licenses are distributed. This probably doesn't happen for many years or until growth stales. 

3) ??? I'm sure there are more.

msnd53,guva6w4,investing,comment,1618676032,"I was just having lazy afternoon today thinking about random stuff. I was thinking how in 2018 everyone was pessimistic about markets because equities were very expensive (by 2018 standards) and companies were loaded with debt. Also growth was slowing down and major companies were reporting lower earnings. Hard to believe but people were worried about Apple as it was selling less iPhones year over year. I remember we had quite a big crash in 2018 but then China saved us. Literally China saved out butts and prevented recession. Then things went as they did afterwards people were again complaining about how equities were very expensive and growth was slowing. There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that. This is very interesting and I'm so interested to see where this will end up.",['AAPL']

&#x200B;

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

AST Spacemobile the real deal with over 1000 patents, extensive satellite expertise particularly their CEO, and their own majority owned satellite subsidiarity Nanoavionics and is already cash flow positive. AST Spacemobile itself has no debt.

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['AMT', 'TWTR', 'MS', 'DISH', 'AAPL']"

mrhrgv,,investing,post,1618502557,"Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

mru1gk,,investing,post,1618540606,"There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock marketHedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['DE', 'TSLA']"

One thing both the Trump and Biden administrations have agreed on is  that the U.S. needs to expand domestic manufacturing, and soon.

The  pharmaceutical industry in particular has outsourced much of its  manufacturing to take advantage of lower costs and more lax  environmental laws in other countries.

mrow7p,gunvqlb,investing,comment,1618528650,"Keep in mind this is highly anecdotal because it's just my opinion as a pharma chemist for over 10 years now, I've worked for a couple start-ups, a couple global top 5 corporations, and a few others like generics.

I don't think the problem is our production capabilities. It's really not too difficult for me to find a job, even in a lot of rural areas. If the government really wanted to they could use the defense production act to pump out assloads of covid vaccines. The problem lies in how the industry works these days.

The big boys - Pfizer, Merck, Bayer... - don't really do much true R&D anymore, it's a better business model for them to let the small fries do that and then just buy them. They have production capabilities but they're relatively limited because they're focused on high volume of specific formulations. As far as markets go, this is the glamorous biotech/pharma wealth and risk everyone is familiar with.

But there's a middle group too, and it's huge. There are thousands of mid-sized pharma companies that usually produce either generics or less profitable out-of-patent pharmaceuticals that are anything but glamorous. This is where America's production ability lies, but the problems with tapping it all stem from the corporate... ecosystem, I guess.

The big boys have the most cutting edge patents (and if they don't they buy them, like Pfizer did with BioNTech), so getting them to share with a handful or more mid-sized companies is difficult. But if you manage that the next issue arises in the meeting of two very different worlds; big pharma and still-tiny-but-not-startup-tiny pharma. It's been going very smoothly so far though, the only problem we've seen was with the Baltimore company making J&J's vaccine.

So to try and relate this to the stock market..... I guess Biden could incentivize big pharma to share important patents with mid-sized companies? Invest in Regeneron?

Maybe there's an etf that focuses on not just mid cap, but mid-range production (volume) companies but other than that I don't see a greater than average profit without getting lucky on a stock.","['MRK', 'UPS', 'PFE']"

mrmmk1,,investing,post,1618516360,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world. 

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

I think you are oversimplifying the demand component of this business. The managed care business was destroyed last year but the occupancy numbers are slowly ticking back up and will be back to normalized levels by next year. People don’t go to these facilities because they want to so the real issue was the quarantine and the lack of normal demand in the system. 

On the financial side of the equation, I think your operating revenue assumptions are also off. They got rid of the worst properties last year and most of the debt that you highlighted is long-term mortgage debt on the real estate. 

I am absolutely aware that they have some work to do but at an $85m market cap today they are easily worth 5x if they can get back on track. This is not guaranteed for sure but a great risk reward from the current price.

I didn't think it looked like a turnaround was coming up soon and passed it by.+ having a ridiculous rally recently doesn't mean anything on its own for any stock. It just got back to it's pre-crash levels. Since it was headed down pre-crash, maybe that does make for a good short entry, but I'd still thinking of it has having come DOWN to the low 40s.- I think your thesis about the loss of old folks is unlikely to hold up. Sure, we lost a bunch of them, but there were already too many.  People are on waiting lists for years, even decades, to get into senior housing. And, we all know that housing in general has a serious supply problem that isn't going away soon.- I guess I'd say compare its fundamentals to peers and base things on that, but also no reason to start a short against short-term momentum either, so now doesn't seem like the time.",

5 EV startups projected they'll hit $10b in revenue faster than Google, the current record holder for fastest to $10b.

Canoo touted a subscription model, an engineering services business, and a partnership with Hyundai.  On their first earnings call, they announced the Hyundai deal was dead, they were transitioning to developing IP for their own products (ie engineering services is dead), and that their subscription model wasn't actually financially viable.  And their CFO left.  One analyst asked if their CEO was still employed in the Q&A (lol).

Lordstown got caught juicing pre-orders.  BREAKING:  Steve Burns is still a hack.  This one shouldn't have surprised anyone...

Multiplan gave projections out to 2025 in the first half of 2020, before they merged.  As a public company, they gave no guidance for 2021 in their Q4 earnings call.

The sum of the revenue projections from Lidar startups that SPAC'd gives $4.6B in 2025.  The projected Lidar TAM in 2025 is \~$3.8B, and these companies have virtually 0 market share today.

Never trust an investor presentation from a SPAC target.",['IP']

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well.","['TSLA', 'AAPL', 'PYPL']"

The monthly transacting users (read: active users) count has barely increased since the peak in 2018.

I wouldn't buy Coinbase above $125 or so a share. I think fees will decrease, the crypto market is overvalued, they have no moat. I'm a happy Coinbase Pro user for what it's worth.",
mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrepwx,guny7b8,investing,comment,1618529894,"I think DISCA might be or in the near future be undervalued due to the dump and shorts. If you're willing to hold out then it could make you some money assuming it progresses normally.

My problem with DISCA lies in a few issues:

1. I think streaming will keep growing, but likely to see downturn post-covid.

2. Restriction of content and no benefit from reopening due to it lacking a movie studio or movie production line. T has Warner. NFLX is buying up studios left and right and recently started winning awards. VIAC has Paramount. Amazon has it's in house studio and can literally buy a studio if it wanted. 

3. It would be incorrect to assume that DISCA's previous highs are a guarantee of future highs or even return to those highs. It (along with VIAC) was runned up and pump by Archegos.

4. DISCA doesn't have other business arms to keep it fighting if the streaming war continues into a battle of attrition or if a sudden price-cutting war breaks out. T brings in tons of money from mobile, internet/phone lines, trad TV, and WarnerMedia that does movies. AMZN is a company that will be around for 100 years and it's making money on everything. NFLX is the incumbent and investors gives it the benefit of the doubt as a tech company and will keep buying even if it loses money every year (unlike DISCA). VIAC has a movie studio and a host of news outlets. DIS has a multiple media empire, MCU owns the movies, has theme parks, owns HULU, and sells toys to kids. Alphabet's youtube is already cash positive and will never go away. Comcast is like T and does telecommunications, movies, and news.

5. All these companies can package their stuff with other things. I get HBOMax free with my internet from T. I've been getting NFLX for $2/month with my T-mobile plan for years now. NFLX is the most popular subscription packaged with other subscriptions that people already use. AMEX Gold and higher cards get it for free. DIS+ is the 2nd most population ""added"" free subscription. AMZN gives it's streaming free as a bonus to prime shipping membership. Comcast gives it's for free with it's telecom offerings. ***What does DISCA package it's streaming with so that it's FREE?***

6. Average number of streaming services a person/family will have is 1-3. Very few will go past 4 or even 5. Now think about where DISCA will fit when [DIS, NFLX, and AMZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_services) are there locking up the top 3. Youtube is always free with streaming as a plus. It's left to fight for the scraps among Hulu, HBOMax, Peacock, Viacom, and AppleTV & other lesser rivals.

7. Content. I don't think Discovery even has the advantage on content. [NFLX/DIS/T/VIAC all beat it in content.](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/ranking-best-original-content-streaming)

8. Moat. There's no moat in the industry. If there was one then it's NFLX's name and the ability to package other services which I mentioned in 5. We're already oversaturated BEFORE factoring new entrants both in the states, Europe, and China.

I won't tell you to NOT buy DISCA. I just think it's a small fish in a crowded and ever-tightening pool of sharks. I've been in GOOG and T for years. The only reason I don't sell T is because I'm just pocketing dividends of the TELECOM company I bought. Not for the streaming. If I were to do some pickup I'd take VIAC over DISCA. 

I am also interested on your opinion on my assessment.","['AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'CMCSA', 'DIS', 'VIAC', 'NFLX', 'DISCA']"

&#x200B;

We went through quite some ups and downs ever since the start of the year, and once again broke off to all time highs.

The past few months seem straight up parabolic/climatic.

The more furious the blow off, the more rapid the correction/pullback.

Can we continue roaring higher without much pullback?

How high can we go before we see a drawn out correction?

Or is it wrong to be expecting such because this is a 'new normal'?

As a rather new investor for about a year I'm really hoping someone can give me a balanced reality check of where we are in the market now and the risks going in, especially marching into all time highs so furiously.

About a month ago I sold all the shares that I had in that company (now worthless) and I’m starting from the bottom again. I’ve got one share of AAPL, MSFT, T, BRK-B, and VZ. I have some etf’s and mutual funds on a watchlist that I want to get back into again once I have more money again.

Best advice I can give is to go for the small wins, don't wait for the big ones. Buy low in undervalued companies and hold. If you did your research, hold strong and wait for the rise. While you wait sell covered calls. This will lower your average cost over time and even if the price never rises you can eventually sell for a profit.",

my8kj6,,StockMarket,post,1619358119,"OTC Micro-Cap GEM! Low Float. New ETH Miner trading significantly at 2021 EBITDA. New Partnerships & Service Agreement in place w/Sparkpool and GMR. PPS run just getting started. Applied Blockchain: APLD  The company has changed their name to Applied Blockchain. You might see Applied Science Technology when you search the ticker.

First, I would like to share I personally spoke to the CEO today (Friday). I sent an email to Brett in their IR dept asking a few questions. I soon received a phone call from Brett asking if I would like to speak directly with the CEO, Wes Cummins. We set up a 3-way call within 10 minutes. It was truly exceptional they took the time to call me on a Friday afternoon with such short notice. 

DD completed with PPS at $.92 (update: current PPS $ $1.40)

**TLDR:** Short Term PPS conservatively at $3.50-$4.00. Short Term catalysts that will cause PPS to jump… #1 Announcement mining rigs have gone live, which is expected in May. #2: Listing on OTCQB. Application process has started.  #3. PPS has increased steadily all week on heavy consolidation. Heavy Ask Volume all week. Continued breakout inevitable with a significant volume spike.

\*I did confirm with their CEO, over $5million in mining rigs were ordered in early April with an estimated delivery time of 4-6 weeks. Rigs are expected to go live in May. I also got confirmation, there are no short term plans for any dilution!

Look at other leading miners like RIOT, MARA, SOS, etc. They are trading at insane multiples with mkt caps in the billions. SOS had a mkt cap of $700 million right after their first 5000 rigs went live. Buying APLD now is getting into a money printing business while its literally building its foundation. IMO, I wouldn't sleep on this one. Its new partnerships with experienced players like Sparkpool and GMR will help expedite their success.

**Full DD:**

**Applied Blockchain, Inc (OTC: APLD)**

All services will be provided to Applied Blockchain, Inc. at SparkPool and GMR's costs, which will allow the company to leverage the large scale and proven efficiency of our partners.

mxy5cx,,StockMarket,post,1619315229,"VOO vs SPY - Why would someone choose the latter?Let's have a fact-based, rational discussion over these two titans. 

Is it only a matter of brand value and trust on SPY's issuer? (hence the higher price of SPY's shares)

**Facts**:

*Strategies are the same*: Both are indexed to SP500

*Dividend difference is negligible* (2 cents)

On the other side, *ER difference is significant*. SPY's ER is three times more expensive than VOO's. 

In the same way, the *difference in price* cannot be dismissed or overlooked. If you plan to keep investing (or reinvesting for that matter) on a regular basis, this will affect the amount of stock you can buy (assuming the difference will remain unchanged).

**Opinion**:

I do not see a strong case to keep both in my portfolio. I am seriously considering selling off my SPY shares and buy more VOO in exchange.

In terms of trading options, wouldn't SPX be even better than SPY? These options are cash settled (if I'm not mistaken) and I think you even more expirations.

In terms of CC, if you are carefully managing your portfolio, you could apply for higher level of option trading. Buy and hold VOO, and then sell calls on SPY (you need 100*(SPY PRICE / VOO price) shares of VOO per SPY calls. Note, this would require careful management.

The world has come to a stop and mental health and addiction issues are not only at all time highs, but these issues are also falling through the cracks. The pandemic is increasing the need for mental health and addiction services due to social isolation, loss of income/financial stability and fear (WHO 2020). All of these issues are exacerbating + worsening problems in mental health and addiction (WHO 2020). Don't forget that COVID 19 itself can lead to neurological problems and mental complications such as delirium, agitation, and stroke according to current research.

IN STEPS MINDMED (ticker MMED, MMEDF ---- uplist ticker MNMD on Tuesday April 27th)

Mindmed uplist is happening at a pivotal time in this pandemic.The company focuses its efforts on bringing ""psychedelic treatment to the forefront through research ultimately creating a new toolset for mental health and addiction"" (Mindmed 2021).

MINDMED IS THE FUTURE

Psychedelics have anecdotally been known to help mental health/illness. This company has a large hand in creating the necessary research/trials that will assist widespread adoption of psychedelic treatment for the reduction of anxiety, depression ADHD and addiction. They currently have phase 2a trials with compounds such as psilocybin and LSD.

MINDMED IS A DISRUPTOR!

BIG PHARMA focuses on pumping and pushing pills to mask symptoms. MINDMED offers real solutions for mental health conditions/issues. ""We are currently researching and developing a broad range of compounds with the goal of unlocking new pathways for patients to experiment SUSTAINED mental healing""(Mindmed 2021).

THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY + A GAME CHANGER
For mental health and addiction, especially in these uncertain times.

There will be a major catalyst for price action movement on Tuesday April 27th once it uplists to the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol MNMD. You can get in Monday before uplist with ticker symbol MMED (Canadian), MMEDF (US). It has easily touched $6 in the past. After Tuesdays uplist I can easily see this headed past $10 to $18 (This is not financial advice)🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💎💎💎💎💎",['NDAQ']

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
> Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
> It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
> As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> # The central bank takes the main stage
> “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
> So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
> There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
> The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
> “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
> Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
> Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
> The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
> “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
> Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
> # Tax hike prospects
> Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
> Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
> Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
> “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
> So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
> David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
> “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
> He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
> “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
> “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
> He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
> Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
> “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

> # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

> As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

> Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

> Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

> # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

> The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

> After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

> The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

> The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

> # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

> “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

> One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

> After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

> “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

> # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

> It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

> We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

> U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

> A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

> # Dips in Short Supply

> While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

> In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

> Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

> # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

> If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**

> The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

> It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

Does anyone out there have a somewhat predictable income for trading stocks? I would love to drop my job and do this full time. Before making that commitment I need to have something to back it up. I’ve been trading for a year an I’m at the 20% annual mark but it would be great to hear about someone doing 50% or better a year consistently. Anyone? The last two weeks I’ve been doing a new strategy and I’m up 60% but I’m just thinking this has to be luck. Please someone tell me otherwise and that kind of return can be possible. Thanks",

It's relatively easy to get high returns in a 1 off year, when compared to getting those same returns over a long period of time. Furthermore I think last year is a bad year to use as an example, anything could have made over 30% if u bought anywhere near the lows.",
my0fg0,gvt0utf,StockMarket,comment,1619347244,"You’ll need different strategies for different market situations. 20% is a huge target. Better have more money in absolute terms, so that 5-10% makes u a good living. 
If you can, code your strategy and backtest it...",
my0fg0,gvt9b68,StockMarket,comment,1619354275,"This last year a 20% return is nothing. This is not a normal year. Stocks were rebounding from serious lows to highs. I would argue a 20% return in this market is low. With that said, I expect the market to get tougher over the next few years. Many predict a crash. I am not quite that doom and gloom but it is possible. 

I have been doing this daily for 10 plus years and investing for 20. Yes, it is possible to average 20% returns but keep in mind the vast majority of traders never beat the S&P, which is well below the 20% goal. This will be much harder over the next few years. 

With that said, it can be done. The key is to avoid loss. It is harder to make money than it is to lose it. If you can avoid loss it is easier to go up because you aren't constantly fixing losses. For this I sell a lot of covered calls and puts in stable companies I wouldn't mind owning long term. I trade massive runs for stability and reliable income generation. I also don't have to worry about price as much as it is not a direct part of my strategy. This has given me consistent returns well above 20% annually for ten years. Last year I was up 300%. This year I will likely be up 100% or more. So yes, it can be done. You just have to find a strategy that works for you.

Also, don't quit your day job until your portfolio is large enough to retire. Why? If you have to pay yourself, you make poor decisions. You also take away from what gets reinvested which means it is harder to grow. Yes, you can live off of a $100k portfolio, but you can't do both live and grow off of it. To do both I suggest having a minimum of $250k to $500k. This will allow you greater comfort in trading. My portfolio is retirement level and I still work full time so I can reinvest my gains. I will likely do it full time after I pay cash for a house with land in another two years. I need to work long enough that I can do this and still have a healthy cash horde to keep trading successfully.",['SPGI']

Ok so may 2nd is the vesting(?) date. 


The price the option was at the day they gave it to us is 106.85, and we have 100 shares.

The current market price as of yesterday was 190.48


I believe it is a non qualified stock option. And I plan on cashing them out the day they are available. The stocks have continued to rise the past couple months, but in worried it will take a dip soon. Especially with a lot of ppl being able to take action on these options.

So the real question. What is the tax rate I will have to pay on the cash out amount? I've heard it is like a 30% capital gains tax. Also have hear it is taxed like regular income. I live in IL if that matters. Thanks!",['PPL']

What I’ve learned:

You pay normal payroll taxes on non-qual options. Usually around 35% or so depending on your taxable income bracket. You have to pay fico, etc. - all the taxes...

Non-qual options do not have capital gains taxes because you never hold them. The time from your beating date to exercise does not count toward capital gains.",

They own Florida Power And Light Company, which is the largest rate-regulated electric utility in the United States. NextEra Energy also owns a competitive clean energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage. Through its subsidiaries, the company generates emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power units in Florida, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin. NextEra Energy is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization, with a market cap of $148.5 billion.

They pay out dividends every quarter with a yield of 1.93%. Their dividend is deemed very safe by analysts meaning it is unlikely to decrease in the future. NextEra Energy has increased its dividend for the last 25 years with an average growth of 9% per year.

The bottom line was also up 11.1% from 36 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. This year-over-year improvement was owing to the company’s proper execution of its growth plans as well as the expansion of its customer base. NextEra Energy’s operating revenues were $4.395 billion missing the analysts' estimates of $4.94 billion by 11%. Their next earnings report is scheduled for Apr 27, 2021.

GEO jumped 7% yesterday, but price of both still looks cheap historically. I think it is still severely undervalued (analysts are saying it’s worth 3X its current value).

I don’t blindly invest in anything I don’t believe in. Most also incorrectly perceive an IPO that goes down in value to be a failure. This is incorrect!!! When the price moves lateral or decreases in the first few days or even weeks, the company has done a fair market valuation, and had achieved the goal of generating capital BACK TO THE COMPANY!!!
That is the objective!! It process the greatest capital capture thus way and fully allows growth.
If the price goes up then all the extra capital is on the public’s hands and actually is a failure of the objective.. while neither scenario is an indication of the future success or failure of the company it does make you pause and query why the price was incorrectly valued in the case where the prices for the ipo goes up..  check into $IMPL

I’ve been setting up my portfolio to basically pump into for the next 10 -15 years and just forget about it, basically low maintenance (with respects to ARKK, I’ll Check quarterly of course). After lots of research, here’s what I’m looking for my portfolio to look like. Let me know if this seems like a good decision or if there’s any improvements or changes I should make. I’ll include 2 different setups with their respective dilemmas. 

(Percentages here are ER’s) 
1. 
VT - 0.08%

Does it make sense to have IVV or QQQ if I already have VT?

mxc81q,gvo6mfg,StockMarket,comment,1619261341,"> Does it make sense to have IVV or QQQ if I already have VT

Not really, since VT already contains those holdings. I guess if you wanted to tilt towards large cap/tech then it would make sense to hold those as well, though I'm not sure why you would want to do that. When you say 'aggressive' here you're referring to uncompensated risk that isn't expected to result in higher yields.

mwvt1b,,StockMarket,post,1619186138,"Learnings from 10 yrs. of Wall St. Experience - how to value stock, what makes stocks move, factors / macro Hey guys!! I spent 10 years on wall st (equity research and market structure) and wanted to help others learn to invest and gauge interest for maybe a paid course / book that puts it all together.

**TLDR: How to value a stock, what makes a stock move, and what to monitor for factors / macros.** 

(Also re-posting from /fluentfinance I thought this could be helpful here too).

If this is helpful - please comment! Do want to invest in a book or course that puts it all together?

**How to actually value a stock.** Super important to have an idea otherwise the market gives you say $DMTK at $70 and then later $40 - which one is correct? You'll want to buy at $80 then sell at $30.

How to do it:

Use 10K and presentation to find the ""drivers"" of the business.

Find the unit economics - for $DMTK, its tests, average selling price (ASP), number of clinicians, utilization of clinician. Then sales people and expected impact. Management will set some targets for these drivers.

That gives a framework to model future sales if they succeed.

Based on the business model and management targets, you can estimate gross margins (very important for scale - they say they can get to 60-70% with higher ASP), then operating margins over time (this will be negative / flat since they are investing in sale to keep growing).

Now you have an estimate of the financials of the business for next 5 years.

Then look for the right multiple. Find the best ""comp"" (comparison) - for $DMTK it's likely $EXAS as genomic testing company. $EXAS is still investing in growth - so its a sales multiple (about 12x forward revenues).

Apply that multiple on your forward estimate (I use 5-years out) assuming company will look like $EXAS and market will value it similarly, then discount back (I use 10% discount rate), which gets a present value in the $70s.

Now you have an idea of what you are betting on - what price the stock could go if management hits their targets, key factors (# of tests, getting ASPs from insurance coverage etc.), what risks you are taking (execution, reimbursement risk) and potential timeframe (at least 3 years).

**What makes a stock move.** Stocks make a whole lot more sense when you realize they are always forward-looking. Every stock will likely have a ""driver"" based on the business model that investors are focused on. Here are the key things you usually want to look for earnings releases:

Forward guidance - is this metric improving (i.e. accelerating on y/y % basis) or slowing (i.e. decelerating on y/y % basis). Very simply, improving is great, slowing can be negative.

Expectations - based on these new forward metrics, are earnings estimates going to move up or move down? (That's also where your model / value of stock is very helpful). When earnings estimates of a stock move up it almost always means the stock is more valuable.

**Awareness of ""factors"" and macro.** In the near-term most stocks move based on ""factors"" which are essentially quantitative groupings of stocks. And this is driven by the ""macro"" or the type of economic environment. As an example:

Factors - if you held any popular stocks ($PLTR, $SE), you felt those swings in the tech or small cap growth (XLK, IWO) over the past month. Or if you held popular China stocks ($BILI, $PDD) you felt the swing in the China market (GXC). Keeping those factors in mind is very helpful to not get scared out of positions (I've done that many times!!), and if you can, time the factors for your entry as well.

Macro - With economies re-opening and coming out of a recessions, the market essentially expects everyone to go out and start spending and activity to accelerate. ""Cyclical"" stocks are the ones moving right now. Airlines ($SAVE, $AAL), autos ($POAHY) as people move around. Retail reopening means better sales ($DBI, $LB). More ""stuff"" produced means materials are moving higher ($FCX, $MP). More growth means higher rates so better profits for banks ($JPM, $UPST).

**Happy investing!!!**","['LB', 'JPM', 'AAL', 'FCX']"

It would be awesome if your example on $DMTK went through the numbers on the 10-K. I think that would be eye opening for some folks. If anyone is wondering where to find the 10-K, go to the investor relations of the company you're looking for. They will have the 10-K and often an Investor Presentation where they try to add context or details, what u/Empty_Performance308 mentioned with identifying the drivers.

mxelzj,,StockMarket,post,1619247594,"How do you find hype stocks (20 percent or more in a shorter time than a year) before they are inflated ?Hello everyone, 
I started to learn about investing a few years ago.mostly about YouTube. Over the last year I also picked up some books. A mix of Jack Bogle, day trading and a few to value companies on fundamental basis. 
That’s all fine and it makes sense to me , will try to invest as much as I can in safe assets like msci world or sp500 .
Especially the whole gme debacle showed me that I don’t want to trust a random guy on YouTube or Reddit about stocks. I can do my own work now and check it his statements make sense, but I feel like I’m missing something about finding good stocks. 
Maybe there isn’t even a way and it’s all luck, i don’t know so I want to ask here.I’m not talking about gme like stocks here. But anything that’s at a potential to gain more than 9 percent a year. 
How do you find such stocks? Are there people consistent at finding them? 
Are there good books or sources? If I try to look for sources about this all I get are YouTube gurus telling me why I need to buy their book.
I just want some source that has some kind of seriousness to it, if there are any.I’m willing to learn, it does not need to be fast or anything.but I always feel like I’m hearing about it a stock or industry after its already inflated. 
If anyone had this question and found anything that helped him answer it, I’d greatly appreciate it. 
And I know this sub isn’t a gambling sub, but the gambling ones are inflated with people that have much opinion without any knowledge ,also the gambling ones are still flooded with gme. 
Thank you very much for reading :)",['MSCI']

Some of it's ears to the street stuff like watching where the degens hang out (WSB/StockTwits), but a lot of it should be conducting your own research IMO.

One example of one that I made double on in a few months is BGFV.  I knew the stores, knew they were undervalued based on their P/E, and the fact that they were giving bonuses to their employees during the pandemic signaled to me that they were in good shape.  Earnings were good too, and being that it was a small-cap and relatively non-hyped, I was in a good position to get in before everyone who bought after me.  I could've made even more if I hadn't sold, and the stock is still undervalued despite having such a significant run up, but I wanted to average down another potential multibagger, and so selling is how I got the money.

mx4mra,,StockMarket,post,1619210559,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 23, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 23, 2021**

Stocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.

Yesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. 

However, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

In other news, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report blew past analyst expectations for the second straight, signaling improving conditions in the labor market and corroborating the pick-up in economic activity as the economy reopens. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended April** **17:** 547,000 vs. 610,000 expected and below last week's total of 576,000
* **Continuing claims, week ended April 3:** 3.674 million vs. 3.650 million expected and below last week’s total of 3.708 million

* Kathy Entwistle, managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), “we’re going to have our own form of the Roaring Twenties.” [(Full quote here)](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/u-economy-own-form-roaring-183205436.html)
* According to the[ Department of Commerce](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf), new home sales surged 20.7% in March compared to February, well above the  14.2% expected for the highest monthly surge since 2006.
* The U.S. manufacturing sector's preliminary purchasing managers' index for April rose to 60.6, from 59.1 in March,[ IHS Markit reported Friday.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/u-s-business-output-expands-most-on-record-ihs-markit-says) This marked the highest level since the firm began tracking the metric. 
* Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos sold off sharply over concerns over higher capital gains taxes, with BTC on route for its worst run of performance in two months.
* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,"" White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.
* In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles.

Is there such an idea where you do not just invest in the property market as a whole but in a group of selected well performing suburbs, riding on their real estate's increased value, without obviously buying houses in each?

A type of mutual fund of the top 500 performing suburbs, for example.

I understand this is not possible and is leading to an idea of a person's home ownership as a type of listed company.

There’s no one stopping you from holding these funds long term, in the end it’s your portfolio, but if you were wise, you wouldn’t hold these funds long term. A fund leveraged to that degree can quickly go bust, should the price of the index/commodity the fund tracks, decline significantly.",

For instance, 10k invested in a simulated 3x leveraged QQQ fund right before the 2001 tech crash would have dropped to like 40 bucks. That investment would have recovered to like 4k by now. So if 100% of your money is in a bigly leveraged ETF, it can suck - not recovering for 20 years is terrible.

Using google sheets, I made a simple [short interest tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10nDrLsU6Y3uNPtJ6fjWImT8uUU-8TdLNHi3ZpGi22ik/htmlview) to keep an eye on stocks with high short interest. I designed it so I can easily identify which heavily shorted stocks *might be* decent long term investments or short term trading opportunities. Obviously, a stock's price is not guaranteed to go parabolic solely due to high short interest but if there is a reasonable chance of that occurring given potential positive catalysts, I want to get in before the stock price skyrockets rather than during a sharp price increase. Tracking the info separate from this SS has helped me generate solid returns on stocks such as ASO, OTRK, and GME (first bought April 2020) so I finally decided this morning to aggregate most of the data I look for into one SS. 

In addition to short interest and what is provided by [highshortinterest.com](https://highshortinterest.com) (where the short interest data is pulled from), the tracker shows relevant, straight-forward metrics including market price, daily as well as relative price changes compared to 52 wk highs/lows, volume, and market cap. I've also included a few sources for borrow rates, insider transactions, and institutional holdings for convenience. **There are definitely other factors to consider when entering these types of positions so please view this tracker for what it is rather than a ""what stock shall I yolo into today"" decision maker.**

Again, nothing fancy as I'm not that good at coding but perhaps some of you will find this useful. Just copy the SS into your own google drive and feel free to modify it to your liking (please excuse any clerical errors).

Hope it helps and lmk if you have any questions!

So, I picked one of the worst offenders, $LADR, and bought puts.\***

*Note: This is my first true DD post. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. This is only my opinion about the stock and any action you take based on my opinions is done at your own risk. In my opinion, I do not like this stock.*

***1.*** ***Intro***

Greetings! I'm excited and a little scared to post my first DD. While I know quite a bit about the market due to my work and education, I will admit that my investment strategy up to this point has been ""buy Vanguard Index Funds."" Safe, but boring. Lately I've been thinking I should go for some higher returns.

So, I've been reading DDs, watching the financial news, and just generally paying more attention to the markets in search of my first options play and I have found my first target: [$LADR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LADR?p=LADR). I'm posting this here in the hopes I can get some good feedback and people smarter then me might point out what I've missed.

***2.*** ***The Target: $LADR***

**Ladder Capital Corp** is a REIT traded on the NYSE with a market cap of just under 1.5BN. It's not a huge company by any stretch and options volume is a little low, but hopefully not so low that this post gets clipped. The company was started after the 2008 crash by three former executives who all worked for an internal real estate hedge fund at UBS. That HF collapsed after making investments in the subprime housing market. **I'm sure they learned their lesson and vowed** ***never to do that again***. RIGHTTTTT.

In fact, what they're doing now is *probably worse*, though the fallout may not be on the same scale as what happened in 2008. After all, the entire CMBS market is only **\~$500B**, as opposed to the residential housing market at \~**$8T** just before the crash (btw, current housing market sits at \~**$35T** \*\*\*whistles\*\*\*)**.** So, even if the entire CMBS industry goes tits up, we're not looking at a complete economic meltdown like we had in 2008, *unless it causes other dominos to fall, but that's another topic..*. Anyway, we can still make money if the thesis is correct, right? So, read on.

What set me down this path was [this recent article](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/), which someone linked in another thread. Take a read if you have a few minutes as it forms the basis of my thesis.

Reading this article first is sort of putting the cart before the horse, but the main point is that [Professor John M. Griffin](http://www.jgriffin.info/bio/) from UTA, decided to do a forensic analysis of claims made by an SEC whistleblower and found those claims to be **correct**. The claims will be discussed in one second, but just know that this guy's specialty is ""*forensic finance, or understanding the role of anything that is potentially illegal, illicit or immoral in financial markets*."" If you want to read the actual paper Mr. Griffin published, you will definitely develop some extra brain wrinkles. The paper can be found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162). It's a good, but technical, read.

Anyway, according to Griffin, the worst offenders when it comes to income overstatement are shown on the right side of this graph:

[Most of the shadow banks above the line on this chart might be good put plays](https://preview.redd.it/ebaje15cfyu61.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da54870761d82be1f77e901963546962964356e)

*Smol aside*: *I was curious if John Griffin and Kenny Griffin from Citadel are related or if it's pure coincidence that they have the same last name. I can't find anything saying they are related, so let's chalk it up to a common last name. That said, it appears that Citadel thinks $LADR is garbage, too, as* [*they have been getting rid of their shares and have purchased substantial additional puts*](https://fintel.io/so/us/ladr/citadel-advisors-llc)*. I feel dirty that I may be on the same side of a bet as Kenny G, but what are ya gonna do???*

Anyway, the genesis of the Griffin study was a 2019 SEC whistleblower complaint that is discussed in this Pro Publica article from  **May of 2020:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds). The article describes a complaint filed by [John Flynn](https://commercialobserver.com/2018/07/john-flynn-cmbs-transparent/), [a veteran of the CMBS industry](http://creloanadvisors.com/), which alleges rampant overstating of borrower income to prop up shitty loans that were packaged into CMBS by 14 major lenders including Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and our target Ladder Capital Corp. The world renowned plaintiff's class action attorneys at **Quinn Emanuel** have taken note of the impending CMBS market correction and issued a very detailed and easy to read [firm memo](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/publications/us-outlook-potential-cmbs-litigation-arising-from-the-2020-downturn/) on the subject, which explains the myriad ways this thing could fall apart.

Anyway, $LADR isn't just taking loans originated by unrelated mortgage loan officers from various banks around the country and packaging those up into shitty CDOs. No no; they are **originating the loans themselves** and then packaging those crap loans together with other, better looking loans, and then **securitizing the garbage for their customers in an inflated CMBS.** I shit you not. Seems weird to risk your reputation by selling crap, but more on that later.

On top of the above, the firm appears to be engaging in some pretty shady practices when repackaging loans acquired from other lenders that had been part of a previous a CMBS that was unwound. Flynn's whistleblower complaint states that Ladder has been revising the previous income statements of the borrowers such that their **net profits were overstated anywhere from 10-30%** from what was reported by the prior lender, meaning they were given much larger loans than they are capable of paying off.

All of this just screams SHORT THIS, but if you want another reason to hate on Ladder, and I'm not trying to make this political, note that one of Ladder's largest investors is **Steven Ross.** If you don't know him, let's just say he's a billionaire BFF with 45 and, get this, Ladder is [one of the Trump organization's biggest creditors.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/09/billionaire-stephen-ross-holds-stake-in-one-of-trumps-biggest-creditors/?sh=7a2848863af4) Whatever you think about Trump as a President, one thing we know for certain is that he's [not that great at real estate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)**. Seriously, don't make this political**. This is about *fraud and bad bets in the CRE market*, not politics.

The final point I will make here is that the outlook for CRE for 2021 is just not that good overall, to say nothing of the CMBS market. The [National Association of Realtors is predicting](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-q4-commercial-real-estate-trends-and-outlook-survey-01-21-2021.pdf) Q1 2021 CRE prices ""to decrease in the office market (-3% y/y), retail (-6% y/y), and hotel/hospitality (-6% y/y)."" Guess what markets $LADR is heavily invested in? That's right; [office, retail, and hospitality](https://s2.q4cdn.com/455099226/files/doc_downloads/company_overview/2021/03/Ladder-Capital-Company-Overview-(March-2021).pdf).

***3. Timing***

So, this shit is shady and Ladder seems ripe for a fall, along with the rest of the CMBS market. In fact, I think you could make this bet against most of the offending lenders identified in the Griffin study, but especially against the shadow banks like Ladder. Thus, the real question is; **when**???

This is a REALLY tough question and where this play certainly opens the door to either major gain or major loss porn. ***Please, only bet what you're able to lose***.

The problem, of course, is that the market was made aware of this malfeasance when Flynn filed his complaint **in February 2019**. Flynn was under the assumption that 10 year commercial loans sold in the run up to 2008 crash would be defaulting in 2017-2018, but that didn't happen. From the Quinn Emanuel memo: ""*Commercial loans backing CMBS typically have a shorter term than the residential mortgage loans backing RMBS, and a different amortization schedule. For example, a standard CMBS loan will have a 10-year term during which it will pay mostly interest and very little (or no) principal, with a large “balloon” payment of principal at the end. Often, the loan is refinanced at the end of its term, meaning that some or all of the balloon payment becomes the subject of a new loan, with a new term, which is frequently then secured in a new CMBS.*"" So, when the original CMBS 1.0 loan defaults didn't show up in the market, Flynn started digging and found that the original loans had simply been repackaged and papered over to new investors based on the **newly restated and inflated NOI** numbers, which triggered his SEC complaint.

But, the SEC hasn't acted on the complaint (AFAIK) and the market just didn't give a shit. Oh yeah, his complaint isn't actually public, either. What's more, Feb 2019-Mar 2020 was a banner year for CMBS returns and commercial real estate in general. Further, most analysts of the CMBS market agree that the new ""CMBS 2.0"" market is much healthier than the CMBS 1.0, i.e. pre-2008, market, so ***there's a chance I am completely wrong on this***.

All that said, the $LADR stock price did plunge from its ATH of **$19** in Feb 2020 to about **$3** in March 2020 due to the **COVID scare** that caused a broader market downturn at that time, but it has steadily inched back up to where it is today, at around **$12**. How can that be if their business is built on a pack of lies?

Well, as the Pro Publica article mentions, the Fed [threw a bunch of money at the CMBS market via the CARES Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm) last April (PPP, mortgage forbearance, etc.), which likely kicked the can down the road. And while Biden's recent **$1.9T** **American Rescue Plan** doesn't contain any *direct support* for the CMBS industry, it's clear that the QE provided by that plan will likely push any widespread CMBS correction further into 2021 or 2022. This aligns with some speculation by the Motley Fool (\*throws up a little\*) back in June that people should keep their eyes open for CMBS failures ""[over the next 12 to 24 months](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/articles/cmbs-fraud-allegations-propublica-and-industry-veteran/)."" There's also an outside chance that the [2020 Hope Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7809?r=98&s=1), which ""*establishes an equity facility in the Department of the Treasury to assist commercial mortgage borrowers*,"" could still pass and kick this failure can further down the road.

All that said, my prediction is that we'll likely see a *short term uptick* in the CRE market as businesses come back on-line following the easing of COVID restrictions, but this won't be enough to save the market from bad underwriting. The [Griffin study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) supports this when it says, on page 4, that ""*the difference between dubious and duteous originators will persist after the current COVID crisis.*"" So, we'll eventually see the house of cards collapse and I'm going to bet it does so **by the end of this year or early next year**. Now, if there is some wider market correction \*\*\*cough CLO/Treasury collapse\*\*\*, this could all happen *much sooner*. Note, the farthest out you can buy puts on this stock is 12/17/2021. \*\*\*sad trombone\*\*\*

I will also be paying close attention to the **$LADR** **Q1 earnings release in early May 2021.** Current EPS consensus is .08/share, which is the same as it was for Q4 2020, but which the company missed by .03/share (actual EPS was .05/share). Note, the company issued a dividend of $.20/share in the lead up to their Q4 2020 earnings report, and they have [done the same for Q1 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladder-capital-corp-announces-first-201500466.html). Accordingly, I'm also predicting **a** **30% miss on EPS for Q1 2021**, just like Q4 last year. I don't anticipate, however, that this EPS miss will have a huge impact on share price. Might drop it a buck or so in the short term. The real fall will come when their shitty loans start going bad later this year.

***4. Target Price***

As far as price goes, this is where I get out of my depth. I am just not equipped to crunch all these numbers from the articles and read financial statements and all that shit in order to say the company is going to drop by X%, so I'm just going with my gut feeling here. **I would really love some help on this point from some wrinkly brain apes who are good with numbers.**

So, I'm just going to look at what happened to the stock back in March 2020 and say that it will probably happen again when the shit hits the fan; ***the price will drop to around \~$4-5/share.***

***5. Counterarguments***

So, there are obviously a lot of counterarguments on which I would be happy to get some feedback. I have considered these, but maybe not weighted them strongly enough, in drawing my conclusions. I welcome your comments and criticism on these and any other counterarguments I may have missed:

* Even if $LADR is chronically overstating the income of their borrowers, the value of **the underlying real estate may be sufficient collateral** to stem any losses from widespread defaults.
* **Most analysts are bullish on this stock**, with the consensus rating now being to **buy**. Current analyst price target range is $12.50 - $14.00 with **an average of $12.80/share**.
* As the Intercept article posted above notes, Ladder's ""[three largest tenants are Dollar General, BJ’s, and Walgreens.](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)” This is good for Ladder given the current inflationary economic environment as consumers are looking for ways to save money and discount retailers benefit from this. In fact, Dollar General is having an amazing year. Their stock price has gone up about [55%](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/DG#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--) from **$140** following the March 2020 crash to **$218** yesterday. So, **if Ladder's largest tenants continue to do well, Ladder may be able to absorb/mitigate any loses** from their poor underwriting for other borrowers.
* **Ladder's business is not limited to CMBS origination and securitization**. They also are a commercial landlord, which could, again, offset any losses from their CMBS shenanigans.
* **Ladder won't be holding the bag** if these CMBS fail; *their investors will*. As the Flynn study notes; ""*the loan originator is not paid according to the loan’s future performance, but from fees and markups when the loan is sold... \[Accordingly,\] originators and underwriters may have incentives to build and burn their reputation.*"" So, there's always a possibility that **these securities fail, but** **Ladder survives**.

***6. Closing***

Boy, if you've read this far, I really appreciate you and would welcome your thoughts and criticism.

I feel pretty good about this thesis, but not good enough to YOLO, since it's my first time doing something like this. In fact, I've only made a very small investment by purchasing the following Puts:

* 20 x 12/17/2021 $7.50p @ $.25/share

If I'm correct, my potential gain is **\~900%:**

|Cost of Contracts (20 contracts @ .25/share = 2000 shares x .25 = $500) + $20 commission|$520|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of 2000 shares @ $5 price target|$10,000|
|Right to sell 2000 shares @ $7.50 strike|$15,000|
|Profit from share sale|$5,000|
|Profit minus cost of contracts|$4,480|
|Total Return (4480/500)|**896%**|

Yes, a \~$4.5K profit on a $500 investment is **small potatoes**, but I want to dip my toe in the water and see if my ape brain is working properly before taking bigger risks.

Let me know what I missed, fellow apes and, again, thanks for reading!

mx7rev,,StockMarket,post,1619220232,"Would you rather?Would you rather have 1 share of Amazon or 5 shares of Nvidia?

I have a IRA with Wells Fargo. I have a variety of Shares in GOOGL, GOOG, Microsoft, APPL, and Amazon.

Wondering what people's thoughts on EOY is for something like Amazon and Nvidia.

Amazon is sitting around $3300. End of the year possibly could be $4000. So $700ish gain from today if it were to sit around $4000 on December 31, 2021.

Now there's Nvidia. Currently sitting around $600. End of the year possibly could be $750ish. So $150ish gain for 1 share

So 1 share of Amazon gains you $700. 5 shares of Nvidia could be $750.

Now look these are just estimates. They could be spot on they could be way off. Amazon could end the year at $4500. Nvidia could end at $1000. Who knows.

All I'm asking is would you rather have 1 share of Amazon or 5 shares on nvidia? Or maybe you have another interest. If not amazon if not nvidia what would you rather have if not either or. 

I'm only asking because I like both companies but Amazon has been idling for 9 months at the same prices. Nvidia has gained significantly. They both have Alot of potential. Something in my gut tells me Nvidia has more growth than Amazon.

Like 5 years later maybe 5 shares of Nvidia nets you more than 1 share of Amazon starting today.

Nvidia OTOH is different. Up until, what is it, two years ago, that it was trading sub-$20 and unlike AMD they got out of the consumer PC market and developed whole new AI chip architecture. Have you seen their videos teaching the AI how to drive?! I mean that’s insane that the only programming this chip got was 5 easy steps in “how to learn”.

mwzy11,,StockMarket,post,1619197496,"ZKIN 2h Outlook
Last time we've taken a look at a higher time frame than our usual 15m one, it was a daily time frame.

The bias of this daily time frame remains unchanged, price found support at trend line and we look at least for a oversold correction to $7 area.

Can the smaller hourly time frame confirm this bias?

As we've said yesterday, we've spotted an important aspect about the chart on larger time frame than the 15m one and now we are bringing it to you.

It seems as the price has formed a trend reversal inverted head and shoulders pattern. A clear break above $5.60 can confirm the pattern break to the upside, however a break above $6 will be a strong confirmation.

Yet a break above $5.90 could be enough to see stronger extended gains.

The hourly overall downtrend now lasts almost a whole month and this trend is not likely to continue as it's very overextended, oversold bounded to a correction higher.

If the price breaks above $5.60, we look the hourly trend to change into an overall uptrend again. 

RSI continues to fail break above 60 bringing bullish momentum into play as the trend is still a downtrend.

MACD is on a buying wave and bullish pressure is increasing.

Key resistance levels.

$5.80
$6.00
$6.33 (pivot resistance), if the price gets stuck here, we may see a bigger inverted head and shoulders pattern.
$6.80
$7.15

If we have to summarize the recent price action, the dips were bought and lack of bearish presence is surely a concern for bears which could lead to potential reversal as price action is suggesting.",
mwl26p,,StockMarket,post,1619144517,"Long Straddle Explained for beginnersHey all, I’m doing a series where I breakdown and simplify popular option strategies while trying to be as concise yet comprehensive as possible. If you will find this helpful, I will appreciate any sort of feedback. For today, we’ll be breaking down the Long Straddle Option Strategy

A long straddle is a directionally unbiased option strategy that involves the purchase of a Call option and a Put option of the same strike price. A long straddle is often set up when a trader speculates that the stock will move in a volatile manner but is uncertain as to which direction the underlying may break out from. Hence a trader would set up a straddle to be able to profit if the underlying breaks out in either direction. However if the stock remains stagnant at expiration, the trader will lose money. [Long straddle trade diagram](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=518#longstraddlediagram)

Long straddles are typically set up At The Money(ATM), which means buying a call and put that have the same strike price as where the stock would be trading at open of the trade. Take a look below as to how a long straddle is constructed. Stock EEE is trading at $200 at open of the trade.

* March 16/21 Long 200 put- $5.00
* March 16/21 Long 200 call- $5.00

**Max loss** 

A straddle’s max loss is the price paid for the put + the price paid for the call. This is called the total debit paid. In this example since we paid $5 for the call and $5 for the put, our total debit paid =$10/1000 which represents the maximum amount we can lose from this trade. Max loss is realised if the stock stays right at the strike price of both options at expiration as both options will expire worthless due to the fact that they will carry no intrinsic value being ATM and no extrinsic value left at expiration. 

**Profit** 
 
A trader profits from a long straddle when the stock breakouts of a range that is determined by the total debit they pay. To find this range, add the total debit paid to the call options strike price and subtract the total debit paid to the put options strike price. In this example since the total debit paid =$10, by adding $10 to the 200 call and subtracting $10 from the 200 put, the range that the stock needs to breakout from in-order for a trader to profit is 190-210 at expiration. The further the stock breaks out of this range whether to the upside or to the downside, the greater the profits. To visualise this, take a look at the prices of the options at expiration after the stock had broken out of this range.

**AT EXPIRATION on Feb 16 2021 the stock is trading at 220**

* March 16/21 Long 200 put- $0.00
* March 16/21 Long 200 call- $20.00

The total debit of the straddle is now at $20. This is because as the stock moved to 220, the 200 call had gained $20 of intrinsic value by expiration. Meanwhile, the 200 put is trading for $0 because it has no intrinsic value and no extrinsic value at expiration. Since you bought the call option at $5 and sell it at $20, you make $15. Now Accounting for the put option, since you bought the put option at $5 and is now worthless at expiration, you lose $5. 
 
As you made $15 on the call and lost $5 on the put, your total P/L is = $10/$1000. The greater the stock moves out of the range, the greater the profit.

**Breakeven** 

The 2 breakeven points are at the exact range points of the range. In this example, 190 and 210 are the range points. For example, this is because at 190 at expiration, the 200 put will trade for $10 and the 200 call will trade for $0. As you sell the put for a $5 profit and lose the $5 paid for the long call that expires worthless, you breakeven on the trade.

**Loss (different from max loss)**

At expiration, If the stock trades between the ranges but not at either breakeven points nor the strike prices, (190.01-199.99) &(200.01-209.99), you will lose money on the trade (losses that are smaller than max loss)The further the stock ends up away from the strike price, the lesser the loss.

**Implied Volatility (Vega)**: A rise in [Implied Volatility](https://optionliteracy.com/?page_id=1005 ) will also be profitable for a Long straddle even if there are no movements in the underlying. This is because this strategy is solely comprised of long options and thus has a positive exposure to vega. 

**Time Decay (Theta)**: The passage of time is inherently a disadvantage for the Long straddle strategy. As this strategy is comprised of solely long options, time decay will be even more rampant than a single leg long option. This is the reason as to why you will need the underlying to move to greater extents so as to offset theta decay

**Exercise and assignment** 

Options are rarely recommended to be be held through expiration. However it is important to understand what happens if they do. Should the underlying trade at the straddles strike price at expiration, both options will expire worthless. If one of the options are ITM and held through expiration, exercise and assignment will take place. Only 1 of the 2 options of this strategy can be ITM at expiration.

mwq2bb,,StockMarket,post,1619163702,"Results after trading with my own strategy.Hello there, 

last year I tried possibly every single trading strategy there is with not really satisfying results, ended up with around 70% profitable trades. This year I went with my own strategy. It's very basic, I use high momentum at market openings and opening 5-10 trades with high volume but low profit.  I treat this as hobby, I am a welding robot programmer as my full time job, so I do this in my free time (which I have a lot). 

I don't use any stop loss honestly, trading on 4h chart only. The only indication for me is momentum. As it goes in one way I watch for the slow down and enter the trade. I hate to admit, but I use a ''feeling'' when to enter. Candles oscillate several times in those 4 hours and I always try to use the extremes, a.k.a. lowest/highest point on that particular candle. 

Let me know what do you think, I trade with a relatively low capital (1,2k) and also hold several profitable stocks as a ''diamond'' backup.

mx0buz,,StockMarket,post,1619198537,"$SPOT with interesting setupChecking out Spotify today and it has some interesting looking action in options market and price chart has some profitable setups. 

First, call action is really heavy today and at the ask with a lot of energy so buyers are paying up for calls in size. 

https://preview.redd.it/ug6nf8axhyu61.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e411d36ae7e228e911452d7495040a2d1d0f802

Second, the overall landscape of the options market by contract is really bullish with calls overwhelming puts on most strikes.

https://preview.redd.it/u9utd671iyu61.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3bc354729e2b42cb6cc6e55eb1b93a1fce21dc0

Gamma Exposure is back to neutral now (after being bearish) so if it flips bullish it will support BTD action in price if it gets started. 

https://preview.redd.it/nk51o1zaiyu61.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b2d4afe606262584884f4fbf4557a1260dbb4f

Looking at the price chart - it held support at the critical bull/bear pivot and is now challenging the VWAP (blue line). IF it clears that then resistance is only at the pink VPOC node (volume point of control) and then the red FVG (unfilled auction gap) at $349. Momentum is picking up stronger and is bullish if today's price action finishes this way. 

https://preview.redd.it/dbpd08qbiyu61.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd7412c47c208276560a1125c03751c845cee74

So two ways to play it as I can tell: 

1) If price breaks through the VWAP then it could easily get bullish up to $349. 

2) If price fails at the VWAP or at the pink VPOC and doesn't get back to $349, then a good short may formulate. 

Good setups forming either way with the action in $SPOT. Definitely some tradable price action.",['GPS']

mxqn2b,,wallstreetbets,post,1619291294,"NrdRage's Friday DD...on a Saturday. Market is as confused as a Zoomer exposed to good music, so instead of something new, let's re-visit the last DD's, see where they shook out, and update them (DD ""Where are they now"" 30 for 30 edition)Hola!   NrdRage here.  My apologies  for not posting this yesterday, but  Reddit, with their extreme ethics  (?) put me in a corner for 3 days for  upvoting a couple of comments my  daughter made about motorcycle  safety.  Good to see their priorities are  in order, An upvote from the  same NAT, that's way more important than  employment background checks  on pedophile enablers, right Reddit?

Given   that last week's DD was my first complete WHIFF (seriously,   embarrassingly bad, but we'll get into that), I'm going to work hard to   find a layup for everybody next week.  Think I've found one, but with   that tax bomb President Harris tossed out yesterday, I don't want to   name a new ticker, even if I think it's all smoke (because the mere act   of sabre rattling can shake a market, and there's sure to be plenty  more  of that in the coming weeks as the administration attempts to  normalize  the plan to create the actual highest cap gains tax rate in  the world).   So instead, let's go back through the DD's (the ones I  haven't deleted  because they were no longer effective, at any rate) and  update them and  where I am with them.  This should hopefully, for at  least a day, stop  people from grabbing a DD from 2 months ago and  jumping in then  wondering why the trade is different.  Oh, who am I  kidding, I know you  fucks, nothing will stop that.  At the very least,  it should shut up the  small group of people who played the trades wrong  and declared them  broken.  Let's start from February, so right after  the first round of  people who ""liked the stock""

# DD #1:  $PLTR.  Original Date January 27th, 2021

&#x200B;

[I tried to tell you retards](https://preview.redd.it/pqrvl3j266v61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b59d3513e9581b0babd63301fc9dd1cb8482387)

**URL:**    Ended up deleting it - not because the DD was wrong, but because the   Palantards got it to about -700 karma and I decided to let them get   crushed.

**Original thesis:**    $PLTR (then $35) was wildly overpriced based not only on their market   cap as a company who's almost every dollar is already priced in as a   result of their reliance upon government contracts, which span years,   their reliance upon the courts to force those contracts to be extended,   but also because the company insiders were selling stock like mad,   George Soros had signaled he was going to sell the 4% of the float he   controlled for ""ethical reasons"" (hah!).  Oh, and because Peter Thiel   participates in the wrong type of political ideology amongst the tech   elite, that he was so unfavored that there would be active attempts to   harm his ventures.

**Original price target:**    I stated the company was worth no more than $22 and that people  should  open $25 puts expiring in late March.  In later comment updates,  I  stated that one should buy puts any time the company strongly  eclipsed  25, and should buy calls any time the company sinks to around  22, as  that's its rangebound territory.

**How did it work/what has changed:**   Not a single thing.  It was literally impossible to screw this trade  up  unless you went against it.  So, of course, most of this sub did  just  that and lost money.

**What the smart play is on it today:**   I no longer buy puts in $PLTR, but any time I see it creep to 22, I  buy  a biweekly $22 call.  Easy money that I will then put on the end of  a  fishing pole and hold over the head of a Palantard.

**Trade rating:**  10/10.  15 bagger (and counting), plus you got to point and laugh at half of this sub.

# DD #2:  Weed Stonks.  Original date February 3rd, 2021 (a non-Friday DD)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rsk2tbc566v61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf756ce0a9fad711fd9fce0af241b7768ec065c3

URL:  [Right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh6ttf/pass_the_bong_and_gather_round_bros_were_gonna/)

**Original thesis:**     You're the bad kind of retarded if you were throwing money into  SNDL.   If you wanted a ""cheap"" stock, you should go with one that  doesn't put  fucking rubber and plastic in their weed - so to buy a  stock like  Organigram instead if you could remember their stupid  fucking name.   $APHA and $TLRY should be joined at the hip and either  APHA must come up  or TLRY must come down.  Talked about $CGC and $ACB,  though didn't  endorse them.  Matter of fact, I didn't really endorse  any of them.   This DD was more about ""well, I can't tell you not to do  this stupid  thing, but if you're going to do it, at least make less bad  choices  amongst the stupid ones"".  Way to make me feel like a pearl  clutching  Boomer parent, assholes.

**Original Price Target:**    I didn't give any, because it was all obviously a bubble and I was   mostly advising people to be careful with the play, but to pick better   companies if you were going to jump in on it.

**How did it work out/what has changed:**    If you read between the lines and TRADED (read:  Scalped like Crazy   Horse) these stocks instead of invested in them, you probably fared   pretty well.  All the weed stocks peaked a week later and then started   their decline (except for $APHA, which continued to rise for a while   before collapsing as it tried to find equilibrium w/ $TLRY).  My own   results were originally mixed on this.  I made a lot of money scalping   Sundial before getting out of the way at the top and laughed as it   collapsed to the surprise of a million braindead stoners.  I made some   pretty decent money on TLRY, made quite a lot on APHA (and then gave it   all back and then some on a stupid play for the merger that expires on   the 30th, a nice 7 figure waste of money), and made some money on   Organigram, but I kept the 1/22 $5c's and am reasonably certain they're a   complete loss, but just like bagging Olivia Munn, there's always a   chance.

**What the smart play is on it today:**    Don't touch any of them.  The reality is, long term, these Canadian   companies are going to have a hard time penetrating the US market, even   if the product is federally legalized.  But, more importantly, the one   thing every weed company has in common with one another is that they  are  absolutely TERRIBLE at execution.  This is why you don't make  stoners  CEO's of publicly traded companies just because they're  passionate about  the product.  They've got the easiest product out  there to sell, and no  matter how low you set the bar, they somehow find  a way to trip over  it.

**What you should play instead if you want to get in this space:**     $MO.  Yeah, you heard me, $MO.  Think about this a moment:  These   guys sell tobacco.  A product that they are forbidden from marketing or   even talking about, which gets hidden away behind cages in stores,  which  has been completely wiped from movies that might product place or  even  being MENTIONED in public because of regulations.  A product  which in  some places it's illegal to use in your own home or alone in  your  vehicle as you take a 10 minute break from your soul-sucking job  and  question every choice you've made in life, just hoping to get 5  minutes  of sweet relief before you have to head back behind the Wendy's  to  finish your shift....and they STILL sell billions of dollars a  year.   Say what you will about their product, but these fuckers **know how to execute.**    And they're already in America.  You don't think that they won't be  at  the front of the pack when that shit gets legalized?  You don't  think  they won't give up the brown leaf for the green leaf?  You don't  think  they won't start buying up every Ganja Goddess or Chronic ReLEAF  store  they can find once they're allowed to?  Fuck outta here.

**Trade rating:**    8/10:  You made money if you followed it and got out a week later,  you  made even more if you caught how lukewarm I was on the entire  sector  and picked something else, and you saved a lot if you got out of  Sundial  like I said, but the weed play really died out a very short  time later,  so the upside was very limited.

# DD #3:  $BB.  Original Date February 12th, 2021

&#x200B;

URL:  [Right here, bitch-o](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liezfr/nrdrages_friday_dd_theres_still_one_meme_stock/)

**Original Thesis:**    Using another company that pivoted from enterprise applications to   automotive ($NUAN) and has no competition, extrapolated long term   earnings potential of a company pivoting from phones to secure   automotive and fleet management.

**Original Price Target:**    87.50.....in 2023.  My positions were very early, so my average PPS  is  7.67 and my calls are 5's, so not really playing the same game.  I  have  since added, over time, a load of 1/23 42c's at an average cost of  like  80 cents.

**How did it work out:**    Thesis still holds, though it would sure be nice if the green number   reflected a mammoth spike in equity price.  The only reason this  company  isn't sitting at 20 right now and well on its way to smart  vehicle  dominance is because of the damned chip shortage.

**What the smart play is on it today:**    It's still buy and tuck away in a hole somewhere like a Boomer.  Grab   the farthest out, farthest OTM calls you can find (they should be no   more than 50 or 60 cents).   You'll still be a massive disappointment to   your parents, but maybe you'll be able to trick them that you're   starting to grow up enough to where they'll let you move out of your   refrigerator box and housesit for them when they go on a cruise.  Hey,   speaking of....

**Trade rating:**    5/10:  I expect this one to age like wine and ultimately be a huge   profit maker, but the chip shortage was a resistance point I failed to   consider so it hasn't seen the immediate burst.

# DD #4:  Cruise lines.  Original Date February 19th, 2021📷

&#x200B;

[Not mine.  But I wants it.](https://preview.redd.it/onkncs8c66v61.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b139c61852f25bfc1b0a4d831afc7aa42eebf86d)

**URL:**  [For you poor bastards who missed this boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnpqrp/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_bermuda_triangle_and_you/)

**Original Thesis:**   The cruise liners were one of the last Wuhan-fucked plays   out       there     who hadn't taken a true turn at the recovery wheel   just   yet.      Which   made   them smooth sailing for easy tendies

**Original Price Target January 2022:**  $NCLH 46, $CCL/$CUK 47/42 respectively, $RCL $90.  My     positions      were    established a month and a half before the DD, so     my cost   basis    was    different.  I was holding 700 1/22 25c's in   $CCL and   2000 1/23    $42.5c's    in $NCLH.

**How did it work out:**    If you jumped in shortly thereafter and played the stocks      right,     you    made enough to buy your own boat.  Sure, maybe it  was  a    17'     Bayliner    that all the women at the marina called    ""adorable""   and  were    clearly    conflating towards what they    assumed was your    pathetic 2.5""    penis size    at diamond hardness,    but it floated, it    had an engine,   and  dammit, it    was yours  and   you had enough left    over for a   captain's  hat and a bunch     of   beer money.  This one  was   hard to screw   up -  especially since  it    was   the first one I   started  providing   updates on  and made  sure    everybody   knew to take   profits  at 32 on   NCLH and buy   back at  29  (and  to continue     playing that  range), etc.    People  in  these   from the date  of posting   who   didn't  just buy and    hold likely    have turned at least a 6    bagger by now.     This trade  was,   and to   some  extent is, still solid    gold.

**What's happened since then:**              In spite of none of the companies in question needing to    issue        shares   as they had enough cash on hand, $RCL issued    shortly  after    that    DD,  $CCL  immediately copied them, and $NCLH    followed  suit a    couple   of  weeks   after $CCL.  At least none of    them tried  to pull  an   $AMC  and   have the   CEO go on TV and  give   zero credit  to retail    investors  for   saving the   company  and   instead taking  all the  credit   before  diluting   and then    paying   himself a fat ass  bonus  for doing   nothing  but issuing    shares like     some sort of  conquering  hero.  The   amount of  the  dilution   in   question   meant  that the  resistance  price  of (to  use  as example,     $NCLH) of $32 a    share  already  represented a   higher  price than   the   pre-virus share   price.    Ditto  for the  other  2.   Investors   haven't seem   to have  noticed,    however,   and these  stocks  still   trade in the  general   range,  though the     resistance  level is now    more like 31/25/85.    Also,  the  sailing    schedules  for  the   domestic  cruise ships has  been  pushed   back  as a   result of     somebody high up at  the CDC  obviously  shorting    these  stocks,  as    that's  the only  explanation  for why they're   so   focused  on trying   to   send these  companies to 0   by  preventing   sailings.    Norwegian  is  resuming  cruises  outside  the  US in the next   couple  of   months.

**What the smart play is today:**              These 3 companies are no longer as attractive as a result  of     the        dilution, but they're still good swing traders within   their       respective     channels.  I'd put up a picture of some   charts to  show      those, but I     already told you where the   resistance is,  grow a      wrinkle and learn  where    support is.

I          have since   exited  my positions in $CCL (and was never in    $RCL),     and   have   drastically  reduced my holdings in $NCLH, but I    do  still     maintain a    skeleton crew  of January calls for them.

**Trade rating:**              9/10.  It was really hard to fuck this one up, unless you    just        didn't   believe me. And it's still a live trade.  The only    thing  I       could have   done better was post it sooner, but I  make   sure my    trades     are   established and going the right way  before I   talk  about   them in     depth.

# DD #5:  The Semiconductors:  Original Date February 26th, 2021

&#x200B;

[And before you ask, yes it is.  Took this the other day when I   decided    to    start working on this. In retrospect, should have   washed first.](https://preview.redd.it/y6vlid9g66v61.jpg?width=1530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bfae5eeadc261cda360675c53f44c33d6ca1582)

**URL:** [For you poor, broke ass souls who missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt89s3/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_semis_play_not_just_the/)

**Original Thesis:**          While everybody was spooging over high end chipmakers like  Theta        Semiconductor, $AMD, and $NVDA (and, to be fair, I had been   telling       people to buy $NVDA 545/580c's, which were all   multibaggers), the   real     action was in the commodity level   chipmaker space,  specifically    American   companies (or companies   that could masquerade  as them) who    would line   up to the trough to   get some free  government money to go    from being   nofab to fab   companies.

**Original Price Target:**          $NXPI 200-210 within 3 months; $ON to within 43 within 3  months,       $MRVL  to 75 within that same range.  And I didn't give a  price   target     for  $UTZ, just that it would go up.

**How did it work out:**          LAMBOS for almost everyone!  Supposing you could order one,   given      that  they can't get the chips they need to build the cars.       $NXPI   got   to  214 before pulling back to 202.  $ON hit 43 2  weeks   before I     predicted  it would.  $MRVL failed to live up to    expectations and has     been  essentially dead money since that    posting, but if you'll  recall I    was  very explicit that I was    bullish on them ONLY as a 5G  play,   whereas  the  others I felt had    more range and scope.  So  short-term   $MRVL play  was a  loser if you    moved up the timeline I  liked.  Oh, and   $UTZ printed  for   everybody   that just bought in  because they liked the   product.  It   was a   nice  little pocket play.

**What's happened since then:**          The trade ran its course to perfection.  As I've been saying  for  a       little while now, semis, with the exception of $NVDA, are  not     presently    an interesting trade because there's been a  rotation out  of    them  after   this period of growth.  I am still  incredibly  bullish  on   the  sector as a   whole, but they need a  breather and  some time  out  of  the  sun before   continuing a leg up.   They're not  even good   rangebound   trades right now.    And LOL @  any of you  clowns who bought   $TSM  anyways  because Cramer  and his  cult of  Shortbus All-Stars   told  you  they were  the best in breed.   Suckers.    In the case of  $MRVL,  they  acquired  another company and  now are  going  to  ""officially""  become a US  company  instead of that  tax  dodging shit   they've been  pulling, which  means the  thesis  about  them lining up for   gubmint  money is sound and  will happen   down the  road.

**What the smart play is today:**         Ignore semis till at least June; probably July.  I have exited   out    of   all of my positions and have taken immense profits from the      commodity   semis.  I similarly got rid of my $NVDA calls at the  top,     though I am   willing to find a re-entry point in the 575 range  if  it    happens.  Don't   be sad that the trade is over, be glad that  it     happened and you might   have been there.  Or at least be happy  that I     was there and am   appreciative that I got to stack a bunch  more  paper    I'll never spend.    Either way.

**Trade rating:**  9/10.  Absolutely perfect call, with only $MRVL being the laggard, but it came with the appropriate warning.

# DD #6:  $CLNE.  Original Date March 5th, 2021

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v4er1pwi66v61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a69c73b90b3d059645e2d9f3f61af090f7c8921

**URL:** [Got buried in a mountain of Gibbons doing dumbass ""DD"" on their stonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/)

**Original Thesis:**         People are finally willing to take greenhouse gas emission   capture      seriously, and the infrastructure and transport sector is   finally   ready    to start moving away from diesel and traditional oil   based   products  in   favor of carbon negative renewable natural gas -     especially  companies   making carbon pledges or located in states   where   progressive  leadership   is going to demand emission reduction.     $CLNE  was uniquely  positioned  as  the nation's leading provider  of   that  fuel source and,  unlike all  the  other green energy   EV/charging   companies out there,  actually has a  real  product that   they sell in   large quantities, making  it a diamond in  the  otherwise   pipe dream   green energy space.

**Original Price Target:**  $17 by late May, $31 by next March

**How did it work out:**         I said to buy it as soon as it got under 11.  It got under 11  the      very  next trading day.  Then immediately shot up almost 50%  within   10    days  and was one of the few stocks out there  consistently   finishing    green  while the entire market was tanking.   As long as you   played it    smart and  heeded warnings about stonks  not always just   going up and    taking profit  after parabolic rises  and looking for   re-entries later,    then you made  enough money to  put RNG high powered   engines in both  your   boat from  cruise stocks  and your Lambo from   semis and convert  your   entire house to  being  powered by cow farts   before the green  energy   sector got   skullfucked.  If you held, you'll   feel this trade  didn't   work out   (though it still will, if you   picked the June target  date like   I  said)  and, if you re-entered   after taking profits, you've  either    been  averaging down lately as   this has been getting unfairly  dragged    down  with the entire green   energy sector or else you're   underwater on    it....but you'll still be   fine.

**What's happened since then:**         A LOT.  From them getting dragged down from the mid 15's all the     way    to below 10 on nothing but good news to them signing major      partnerships   with $BP, Total and Citgo, to signing a half a billion      dollar deal  with  $AMZN to power their long-haul fleet with RNG to      Washington DC  flat-out  stating that methane capture is a capstone  of     their green  energy plan,  there has been nothing but good news  coming     out of this  company.  And  yet It got absolutely PUMMELED  with the     sector for the  last month, and  then this past week  started Monday     morning up 27% only  to not only give  all of those  gains back but  lose    another 20% by the  close of trading  Tuesday  because of a  combination    of market  manipulation by a hedge fund   that shorted the  stock into    oblivion for a  hit and run (do a search  on my profile by  posts and  look   up my Wednesday discussion if you  want to be  absolutely fucking    infuriated that someone borderline  committed a  crime) coupled with them    paying off an analyst at RayJay  to run a hit  piece on the $AMZN deal  to   try and sink  the stock  price even lower,  right down to that hedge   fund  suppressing  the  price of the stock  for 2 weeks to keep it under   $12 so  the most   popular options for  April would expire worthless.    This  company has,  in  short, been  subjected to a biblical level of   fuckery  that was  probably  was some  Mortimer Brothers bullshit for a $1   bet, and  it's  still  standing and  ready to spring. Oh, and somebody   informed  me  that they  got some  airtime on Cramer's show on the 24th.    Jimmy  Retard  is luekwarm on   them, and you should always inverse him,   so  balls to the  wall, baby.    Especially since he tried to compare the    2009 version of  this  company  (when nobody gave 2 shits about nat   gas)  with the 2021   version (where  governments are going to force   people  into this type  of  product and the  transport industry is   finally  transitioning away  from  oil).

**What   the smart play  is today:**    My thesis, as written back then, is  EXACTLY  what I would  write even   today.  I stand by every last thing  in there,  including  the strike date   and price, in spite of the hedge  fund  bullshit that  artificially tanked the stock for no reason other  than  unmitigated  greed.  It was my   favorite stock in the whole  market then,  and it  still is now, just   balanced against the  knowledge that, as a  very  small midcap bordering on   a small cap,  it's easy to push around  and  very clearly fucked some hedge fund  manager's wife or something. If  you  don't believe me, every   analyst  out there says this company is  worth  double what it's at now. My  original position still exists, except now  it's bigger and I'm also the  owner of a lot (and I mean a LOT) of shares  on top of it that I was  gobbling up like a porn star eating all the  money shots in an episode  of Blacked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

**Trade rating:**    10/10.   Nobody was talking about it before that DD.  You made a   multi-bagger in  just a few days if you jumped in, and even though   you're battered and  bloody right now on the 2nd run with them because   of the manipulation  from a hedge, you're still going to make mad   tendies with this one.   They've got EVERYTHING going for them,   corporate America is looking to  them for the carbon negative fuel as an   easy way to lower their  footprints, no competition other than a  shitty  (4 letter word for non IPO company) building their first   capture plant  who has NO fueling depots or infrastructure, politicians   demanding  carbon neutral fuel and, unlike most of the sector they  reside  in,  actually have a product and make money.

**URL:** [Lazy bitch can't even search for it yourself?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3mhkm/nrdrages_friday_dd_spring_is_in_the_air_the_birds/)

**The thesis:**     The clusterfuck in Texas this past winter, combined with  California's   annual inability to provide even basic electricity to its  residents as   the state burns to the ground and they try to push  everybody into  EV's,  created a unique opportunity for a green energy  company that  existed  completely in its own space:  Weather immune  green energy  microgrids  that could scale to any size, literally NEVER  go down as has  been proven  by large-scale pilots in Delaware and Cal  Tech,  and  didn't have the  drawbacks of batteries.  Oh, and  politicians finally  acknowledging that  our utility grid is well beyond  end of life and hot  garbage and not  wanting voters blaming them for  citizen deaths being  willing to spend  taxpayer money to address that.

**Original Price Target:**  70% conviction of a $32 price by mid-April, 45-50 by August, and a long term target of $72

**How did it work out:**    I  had the unfortunate pleasure of posting this DD right as the  entire   green energy space was being crushed by big money rotating into   ""value""  and later into ""the 10 biggest companies in the S&P to  make  SPY go  up"", so things haven't gone as planned to this point.  The   stock has  actually fallen from the 27's all the way down into the  22's,  though it  has rebounded this week and looks to be starting a  fresh  run.  It's a  bit of a hail Mary, but that 5/21 32c that I was  hyping  back then....it  might still print.  Though even I rolled over  my May  calls to August at  the same strike to buy more time to make up  for them  getting dragged  down with a bunch of companies that aren't  even in the  same space as  these dudes.

**What happened since then:**     They haven't announced any big deals, but I know they're working on    some.  And they set up a new global office in Dubai to start marketing    their products worldwide, which should only give them tailwinds going    forward.

**What the smart play is today:**     I still stand behind everything written in that DD, with the only    thing I'd like to change is the expiry date on the calls from May to    August.  And again, if you're sitting on May calls that are way, WAY    down....I wouldn't cut bait with them just yet just because they're    already almost worthless and there's still a puncher's chance they fight    back.  This thing has started to get some life, and I wouldn't bet    against it being able to hit that strike in a month - well, I wouldn't    bet a lot.  I would just feel better if it were 4.  Long term, this is    still going to be a great investment.

**Trade rating:**    I was  going to give this one a 2/10 just because it had been going   almost  straight down for weeks now killing the May expirys, but the   longer  calls and shares are still very much alive, but I'm going to   upgrade it  to a 3.5 because it's made some good movement, and I will   cross my  fingers that, by this time next month, I'll call it a 6.

**URL:** [How was this one of my most popular DD's?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8inij/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_absolute_shittiest_company/)

**The thesis:**     Simple:  A re-opening play.  $RYCEY is one of the only companies in    the world that has not rebounded from the pandemic, and as soon as    people start flying en masse again, demand for their engines (and    maintenance contracts) will start buoying the stock price

**How did it work out:**     I said buy shares and tuck them away.  The stock hasn't really moved    since that DD, and should still be tucked away.  The condition for   their  recovery (increased air travel) has not yet happened, therefore,   it's  not their turn yet.

**What happened since then:**     People have continued to be afraid of their own shadows.  Especially    the Europoors, even though England no longer even has enough cases to    qualify as being in a pandemic.  Dumbasses.

**What the smart play is today:**  Same as it was then.  Buy shares.  Hold.  My positions haven't changed.

**Trade rating:**  4/10.  Their turn for recovery is taking forever, but it'll get there.

# DD #9:  $NVTA.  Original Date April 2nd, 2021 (no DD the week before)

**The thesis:**   One of the  few biotech companies in the world worth betting on long  term.   Transformational technology, market leader.  Also, gave me an   opportunity to collaborate with Cathie about the stock (though, because   of my, to be charitable ""un-PC"" vernacular, she declined to put her  name  on the DD).

**Original Price Target:**  50 by mid June, 60's by 2021

**How did it work out:**    We're now officially in the space where the long-game trades are  still  developing and can't yet be judged.  The stock, typical of every   biotech, has been very choppy in this uncertain market.  It opened up   big a couple of days after the DD, but has drifted downwards since that   point.  The volatility still makes it a great intraday scalper, and the   thesis is still sound.

**What happened since then:**   The rotation away from high multiple high growth stocks has continued,  especially after President Harris  proposed increasing the cap gains  tax to the highest in the world.

**What the smart play is today:**    I stand behind the DD and thesis, and the entry points are still   attractive.  I would move the strike price down into the low-mid 40's,   however.  My position has not changed.

**Trade Rating:**  Incomplete.  Still developing.  I was very clear this one was not for the faint of heart.

# DD #10:  $NEE.  Original Date April 9th, 2021

**URL:** [You're late, but here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnksim/nrdrages_friday_dd_ill_take_a_mackinnon_jersey_2/)

**The thesis:**    The $ICLN ETF, which was mostly just $PLUG, was rebalancing in a big   way; Blackrock would thus be purchasing massive quantities of shares of   stock in the new companies.  $NEE was uniquely positioned because it  had  the stability and rotation safety of a value stock, but the  multiple of  a growth stock

**Price targets:**  I said definitely take profits at 83, and my positions were June 75's and 77.50's.

**How did it work out:**    Flawlessly.  The stock basically rocketed to $80 as Blackrock   purchased shares much more aggressively than anticipated, and anyone who   played this trade with me and watched volume would have noticed the   volume fell off a cliff and took profits before it started creeping back   down (as everybody else was taking profits, too).  I exited my   positions near the top and stacked all the money in an air conditioned,   humidity controlled room that consumes immense amounts of coal power.

**What happened since then:**    The share price has started to pull back, which was expected.    Further, they had an earnings call, and you should almost never play   earnings in this environment.

**What the smart play is today:**    This trade is effectively finished - it was predicated upon a   rebalance, the rebalance happened, it was a lot of fun, we all made lots   of money.  This is still a really well run company but the short-term   thesis is no longer valid.  The DD will stay up only as a display of  the  company's operations, margins, and overall growth potential if you  want  to act like a Boomer and be a long-term investor.  I pulled out  all of  my short-term positions, and only maintain shares at this stage.

**Trade rating:**    10/10.  Took even less time than expected for the trade to complete,   and was never in any danger of doing anything but printing tendies.  No   matter when you bought leading up to the rebalance, your position was   green and stayed that way the whole time.

# DD #11:  $ISRG.  Original Date April 16th, 2021:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ms2pwzhs66v61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d5a30b34e00bb9b21c4571cbc053739206ce54

**URL:** [Thus proving I'm not the Zombie Jew](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms51jy/nrdrages_friday_dd_a_robot_may_not_injure_a_human/)

**The thesis:**    A pure earnings play that I didn't really want to write, but my 1st   idea ($PLUG puts) ran its course before Friday.  Analysts had been   lowering expectations for $ISRG for weeks, and even management was   saying things to make it seem like they were going to have a subpar   quarter.  Which made sense, given that a lot of operating theatres are   still closed.

**Price Targets:**    As it was an earnings play, didn't list any long term, but suggested   going long in a company that typically only melts upwards when the  stock  fell by 60 or 70 bucks.

**How did it work out:**    Not even slightly.  At all.  Absolutely TERRIBLE call.  They blew the   doors off earnings, beating by more than a dollar those lowered  analyst  expectations.  Sales were up.  Procedures were up.  Everything  was up.   Instead of going down 10% on weakened guidance, the stock shot  up 5% and  blasted through all-time-highs.  This was a big time loser  of a trade.

**So why did it happen:**   I can't take credit for digging this up, that credit goes to /u/Farmer_eh who did  all the sleuthing of HOW they pulled it off.  It turns out  $ISRG  accelerated depreciation on a lot of their production equipment,  and  also had an increase in inventory.  This means that they had a bunch  of  extra Da Vincis laying around in a warehouse and were selling them  to  medical centers at a steep discount, which is why they sold so many   more robots than any analyst expected (30% more than pre-COVID sales),   and also lowered their expenses for the quarter.  These are neat tricks   that a company can only pull every so often, and it was smart of $ISRG   to not only have that one in their pocket for a rainy day, but also the   wherewithall to play the card at the best possible moment.  So, in a   way, the thesis itself was sound and the quarter would, in fact, have   been a down one had they just been organic about it all, but I failed to   account for easily accomplished accounting magic and motivated sale   pricing to ensure a quarterly beat.  Which is something I'll remember   next time I think about shorting a company that beats on quarterlies   almost 90% of  the time.

**What the smart play is today:**    The original DD talked about letting the stock price come down and   then going long, because this is a company that is mostly always going   to go up.  However, it's run up so fast after those earnings that even   long is a dicey play now, so this is a company that, if you aren't   already in, you should probably stay away from.  However, buried in that   DD was commentary about how $PLUG had been beaten down to the level I   wanted to see it go to already, and that it was time to go long in  them.   I've had a couple of you message me, showing that you had read  between  the lines,  to say you covered your puts after that and went  into  calls.  So those are paying off.  As the green energy sector is  starting  to rebound a bit, $PLUG will naturally get caught up in that,  so  there's a play there.

**Trade rating:**    1/10.  It was going to be a 0, but, as mentioned above, if you had   read between the lines there, there was a secondary play buried in there   about $PLUG calls, so I'll give 1 single, solitary point on this   otherwise complete dumpster fire of a call.

All my love

30 patients have been dosed so far. This drug treats two different diseases-- sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. 

Everyone that has done followup for this trial is symptom free. The people with sickle cell disease have been free of vasoocclusice crises, which is an incredibly painful occlusion of blood vessels. And the people with beta thalassemia have been transfusion independent.

Severe presentations of these diseases cost north of 300k/USD a year to treat, fyi.

my0fns,,wallstreetbets,post,1619323560,"Calling all apes: CLF cleveland cliffs, diamond hands? Why not steel hands?Edit\* position 232 shares followed by 20 call options spread across the year

Hello, today I am going to try and convince you why you should buy CLF, before we go any further you should know I have about 1/3 of my total cash invested into CLF. Here is a list of catalysts.

**1.** Steel Prices continue to rise with no sign of slowing down.

according to this chart [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) Steel has been trading at all time highs week after week. This is due to a supply shortage. Steel demand has not gone down since Nov 20 2020.

**2.**  Infrastructure spending trends worldwide are on an upward climb

This chart is a prediction of future infrastructure spending globally  [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/four-big-infrastructure-trends-for-2021/) but aside from this prediction it is not a secret that Biden plans to compete with China and Russia on infrastructure, In his press conference when he released his infrastructure bill He said he wanted to beat China. Most if not all infrastructure spending will involve steel or other building materials in some way or another. If 3 main world superpowers are fighting over economic dominance in infrastructure this will continue to raise steel prices.

**3.**  CLF is not a stranger to massive increases in stock price.

Back in June 6th 2008 it rose to 104$ a share and then in April 8th 2011it rose to 98$ a share. These were due to similar circumstances we are seeing in the steel Market today with these non stop increases.

**4.** We are currently in a commodity super cycle.

If you look around you will not only see steel vastly increasing but you also steel OSB sheets of plywood now going for 70$ a sheet. Other commodities increasing on a similar scale to steel are. Bitumen, Nickel, copper. With all of these commodities increasing at the same time its safe to assume demand keeps going up with the anticipation of the infrastructure plans as well as seasonal summer construction.

**5.**  China plans to cut its rebate on steel.

according to this [https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/steel-traders-alert-for-china-steel-export-rebate-cuts/) China plans to cut its steel rebate dramatically. Its not a shock that with rising steel prices they wouldn't want to purposely take a hit to their trade export revenue. If China cuts the rebate down it will spike Steel prices worldwide.

**6.**  China plans to cut steel production to meet carbon emission goals.

China is finally going somewhat green. (finally) With china lowering steel production this would drive steel prices up substantially due to supply not being able to meet demand. Scarcity could be a short term catalyst but a catalyst nonetheless.

Well MP sits at a mining site in the middle of the desert out near the Cali-Nevada border.  [They sit just south of Las Vegas](https://www.google.com/maps/search/mp+materials/@35.4652108,-115.5387785,17915m/data=!3m1!1e3) right next to a highway for easy transport of the extracted and purified materials as they both mine and refine the ore. 
 
Well let's start with what they do: rare earth materials mining.  Not the sexiest job on the planet, but it is necessary for all things tech.  Rare earths are a key component of clean energy, IT, defense, industrial applications, and neat little magnets.  [China was by far the #1 producer with 83% of the total worldwide production](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prd-wret/assets/palladium/production/mineral-pubs/rare-earth/mcs-2017-raree.pdf) but now with MP Materials pumping out ore [they have fallen to only 58% of total worldwide production](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-rare-earths.pdf)    
 
The market isn't going away but China could pull it's supply which is a huge risk to the US tech industry.  On top of this, demand will be skyrocketing with a [projected increase in electric car production from 2.5M per year now to 31M per year in 2030!](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html).  More specifically the annual demand for [rare earth magnet oxides are expected to increase 5x in the next 10 years to $16bln](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/astronomical-rare-earth-demand-growth-forecast-2020-09-29) - and if that isn’t enough potential revenue then also consider next year [MP will have finished their own on site processing facility to produced finished metals instead of ore](https://mpmaterials.com/about/).
 
Also worth considering [China is only the leader because their population bears the cost of production that will likely see boycotts or backlash as new facilities are available](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-07-28/china-rare-earth-tech-pollution-supply-chain-trade) and [MP has created a sustainable process for extraction](https://mpmaterials.com/sustainability/), so likely the top brands will start pushing for more sustainable processes with less negative impact and potentially force China to clean up their act / increase cost.  
 
The US-China relations are at a pretty fragile point.  [NASA has even called Taiwan a country](https://www.newsweek.com/unforgivable-china-furious-nasa-calling-taiwan-country-1580084) which is a hugely sensitive issue.   The current administration seeks to counter Chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been [reviewing the reliance on China for rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-biden-order/biden-to-order-review-of-u-s-reliance-on-overseas-supply-chains-for-semiconductors-rare-earths-cnbc-idUSKBN2AI2HJ).  
 
[The price of rare earths is rising, and it caused a jump in the stock price earlier in the month](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mp-materials-quarterly-profit-jumps-on-rising-rare-earths-prices-2021-03-18) - the soaring need for electric vehicles should continue to push it further.  Though the stock price jumped, it did plummet on news that they were [issuing some additional shares, about 10%, to fund new green energy initiatives.](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2021/MP-Materials-Announces-Pricing-of-600-Million-Green-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx).  With a larger focus on environmentally friendly projects, it makes $MP a prime target for eco-conscious investors.  
 
In my opinion, the price dive spooked a large amount of investors sending it way below it's fair value.  10% dilution rocked it to a 30% price dive that it is coming back from strongly now.  It’s also worth noting the share offering was at $35, which is $5 more than the current price - meaning the serious buyers know the value of the stock is well above its current value.  $MP doubled the analyst estimates for EPS in Q4 last year and don't look to be slowing down.  [Looking ahead, the forward looking EPS estimates put it at close to $2 for a 15 p/e ratio](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates) with $0.38 EPS in 2021 - and they’ve only been operating for four years!  2022 EPS is expected to jump more than 50% to $0.58 and that is **before their processing plant is even open!**.  It’s not too hard to see that growth continuing with the addition of selling finished materials, increased demand, and increased price of the rare earth products which is on pace to continue for the next 10 years.  
 
MP materials hasn't been around long, taking over the site from failed Molycorp, but appear to be hitting it at a good time.  Now not only are they expected to be profitable quickly, but also have the new $584m in cash to ramp up and clean up their operation to ensure a sustainable and competitive supplier of rare earths.
 
If you look at their earnings presentation: https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf, the story keeps getting better though.  They had 100% YoY revenue growth and are still reducing the cost of production.  Modest for Q4 YoY, but 25% for the entire year.  
 
So that’s the basics of MP, but why the hell should you buy now?!?!?  Well, let’s look at the [current short borrow utilization](https://imgur.com/gallery/EJFwoFR) - that big drop - it wasn’t people selling, it was an 18M share short attack! Now the short utilization is up to a whopping **93% and climbing!**  (Note: I prefer FF on loan for Ortex because it tracks the SI much closer than their estimated SI).  So now the price is climbing again, they are almost out of shorts to borrow, and shit out of luck.  As they cover over the next month or two - we can expect the price to rise easily back up to $45, especially with the Q1 earnings call around the corner.  And when they beat earnings….. It’s gonna fly!  
 
On top of that, the growth stocks have all been on a severe downtrend over the last month - but are popping back into fashion now.   With the huge SI, low share availability with only 130M shares, and momentum of growth stocks in vogue today - shit’s gonna sail.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0luibhk7lzu61.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=b91a895346e9df73c2505b5ecae087c86f465405)

Hello apes, have not posted a technical analysis in a while. Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.

\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$

\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!

\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.

\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.

\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.

Please have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.

TL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr 🚀 🚀 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",

Anyways, MindMed has been trading OTC in like Canada's market or something (I guess there are companies that exist outside the USA) so only brokers that allow OTC trading let you buy it. As of today though not anymore!

They announced that they will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 under the symbol: MNMD.

Reasons I invested:

1 To get in before Nasdaq listing (not too late to do so)

2 Always saw the psychedelic market to be the next drug market to boom (It still is relatively new market, more research and potential catalyst in the future)

3 I believe in the research (our generation is like number 1 in rising depression cases and most treatment for depression sucks. This research can be revolutionary for depressed apes that Yolo'd too many FDs or actual depressed apes that aren't retards.\[Edit: Other mental health issues they are studying to treat are; anxiety, addiction and ADHD\])

4 Kevin O'leary AKA Mr. Wonderful is invested in it (I usually don't buy into celebrity endorsements but Mr. Wonderful believes in the company and he doesn't invest in something he would lose money in. Also he did mention MindMed to Cathie Wood in a four panel interview on CNBC a week or two ago. So possible Cathie Wood interest after listing)

5 Nasdaq listing allows more money to flow in (after April 27 robinhood retards can throw YOLO money into it)

6 I like the Stock

The only disclaimer is that I am not a financial advisor and this would've been a YOLO post if I didn't lose so much money on stupid PLTR calls

Mods plz this is my first legit post here ever

edited a lil more info

Edit2: So there are people getting banned for mentioning the OTC ticker because its not 1b market cap. But it def is over 1b, sitting at 1.1b rn on Yahoo.

This post will make papa Burry and DFV proud. The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. 

https://preview.redd.it/3se5sge395v61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca701e6aec738f0c3c6223162bc1c9b030b2ba7

I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings)

You will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the float)

https://preview.redd.it/evbe7l9i95v61.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76db8d2fe90767a78cbbe271b1399bda533d5fd

Per my previous DD post and per the above screen shot 34.4% of the float is shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491 gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get 11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has 11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us retail gamblers.

Practically the entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely shorted. The fundamentals are the prettiest thing I've ever seen when it comes to analyzing stocks.

mxoljm,,wallstreetbets,post,1619285351,"$FUBO - Stock Analysis (Warning - Long DD)# Company Description:

FuboTV is a live TV streaming company focused primarily on sports which offers subscribers access to thousands of live sporting events, news, and entertainment content. The FuboTV platform allows users to have access to their content through streaming devices such as SmartTV's, mobile phones, computers, and tablets. This company gives the option to purchase additional features/packages that include more DVR cloud storage, number of simultaneous streams, international sports, adventure channels, etc. The base package provides a mixture of channels which includes the top 50 Nielson-ranked networks that span across sports, news, and entertainment. In the summer of 2020, they enhanced their sports offerings with the addition of ESPN and ABC as well as programming from Disney. In addition, FuboTV supports 4K streaming, although much of its content is streamed at 720p and 60 frames-per-second video quality. Since live TV requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure, Fubo utilizes industry standard digital Rights Management Technology and geographical rights requirements which enables them to meet blackouts if they were to occur. With all that content, FuboTV is one of the most expensive live tv packages that you can buy. Their competitors include the likes of YouTube TV ($64.99), Sling TV ($35.00), Hulu Live TV ($65), and more. Fubo's growth strategy is focused on acquiring new subscribers who are attracted to the sports and entertainment offerings that they provide. They monetize their subscriber base through subscription fees and digital advertising and in 2020 the majority of their revenue came from monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, in January of 2021 Fubo announced that they plan on acquiring sports betting and interactive gaming company Vigtory (see recent acquisition section) and they expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year.

# Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Live TV streaming is changing the way people watch their favorite sports, shows, and other entertainment content. As a result, more people are deciding to stop paying for traditional TV. Due to this disruption, billions of dollars in subscription and advertising revenue has shifted to streaming platforms. The global video streaming market size was valued at $50.11 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 21% from 2021 to 2028. In addition to the streaming market which Fubo currently operates in, their commitment to providing sports betting has expanded their total addressable market. The global sports betting industry reached a market size of $203 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by $144.4 billion from 2020-2024 (11% CAGR). What hinders the growth of this industry is the fact that sports betting is still illegal in many parts of the world. Sports betting is currently legal in a number of states in the US and in countries such as the UK, Denmark, Italy, China, and a few others. While sports betting is legal in a number of countries, often times people have limited access. For example, in Costa Rica you can only bet online and in India only a few states allow sports betting.

If we add together the total addressable markets for live TV streaming and sports betting in the year of 2020 we get $253.11 billion. Compare that number to Fubo's revenue of $268.8 million in 2020 and we see that Fubo has a huge opportunity ahead of itself. As Fubo scales their new sports betting business and more countries and states make sports betting legal, we should see Fubo ramping up revenue growth significantly. Of course their is a risk to all this as it is very costly to scale both businesses that Fubo operates. Thus, their financial results will give us an idea of how they've been growing and if they can maintain the level of growth they've seen in the past.

# Important Points to Address

* Revenue was up 83% YoY as advertising revenue grew to $29 million (up 133% YoY) and subscription revenue increased 73% to $230.7 million. As we can see from the numbers, this company is growing at a fast clip. Although the revenue growth they reported is impressive, when looking at their balance sheet they still reported an operating loss of roughly $480 million which was a drastic increase from the prior year which came in at $39 million. Additionally, as this business has scaled they saw their operating expenses jump from $43 million in 2019 to $698 million in 2020 and their goodwill reach $478 million. What these numbers show me is that while this company is growing fast, much of that growth isn't necessarily organic. They spent $63 million on advertising in 2020, while only spending $491,000 in 2019. Also, their general and administrative expenses jumped from $13 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020. While some investors may argue that this business is taking on significant costs short-term so they can succeed in the long-term, I'm worried that heavy competition will slow down their growth. One final thing to note about their expenses is that currently they're losing money on the subscription plans that they offer as their subscriptions revenue was $184 million for 2020, while their subscriber related expenses totaled $204 million. Fubo is up against some strong competitors such as Google with their YouTube TV platform, Sling, Roku, and other streaming services. In the future, we'll see how those expenses change in relation to their revenue as they scale their new sports gambling business.
* Fubo reported reaching 547,880 subscribers in 2020 which was a result of them growing their subscriber base by 261,754 subscribers. As they scaled their subscriber base, average revenue per paying user increased by 17% YoY to $62.84 and total content hours streamed grew 82% YoY to 544.9 million hours. These numbers are impressive as well, but I question how much of that growth was a result of the Covid lockdowns. 2021 is the important year we're going to have to pay attention to in order to get an idea of how this company operates in more 'normal' times.
* The final things I want to mention about Fubo's finances has to do with their current ratio and goodwill. Fubo reported current asset and liabilities of $156 and $227 million respectively, which puts their current ratio at 0.6. For any company to have a current ratio of 0.6 is worrisome in my eyes. Additionally, if you go a bit down their balance sheet you will notice that their goodwill is $478 million. Goodwill arises when one company purchases another. Goodwill is an intangible asset that is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of one company's liabilities from the amount the acquiring company pays for it. The amount of goodwill we're seeing with Fubo is quite high considering their total assets would drop by 50% if they didn't measure it.

# Recent Developments/Acquisitions

* In January of 2021, Fubo announced that they will be acquiring the sports betting and iGaming company Vigtory. The CEO David Gandler stated that, ""We don't see wagering as simply an add-on product to fuboTV. Instead, we believe there is a real flywheel opportunity with streaming video content and interactivity."" I agree with this move made by the CEO as betting is a great compliment to their sports-first TV streaming platform. Fubo's sportsbook is expected to be released sometime mid 2021 and they could see adoption in three states by the end of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out considering the heavy competition in the sports betting market. Some of the biggest names in the sports betting market include DraftKings Inc (DKNG), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Bragg Gaming Group (BRGGF), and more.
* In April of 2021, Fubo announced they were acquiring the exclusive live streaming rights to the South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches. CEO David Gandler said, ""By offering the best of South American soccer in advance of Qatar 2022, we are further differentiating FuboTV’s sports-first content portfolio enabling us to engage with more consumers than ever before.” Once again, I agree with the CEO and this move highlighted his dedication to making Fubo a sports streaming giant. This deal will help Fubo's brand name as this company will be advertising to millions of viewers. David is coming into the sports streaming market aggressively and investors will be awaiting to see how this acquisition will play out financially.
* In December of 2020, Fubo announced that they acquired Balto Sports. This deal marked Fubo's first move into the online wagering market. At the time the CEO was quoted saying, ""We believe there are significant synergies between consumers who enjoy wagering and our subscribers who enjoy streaming live sports, creating a flywheel opportunity. As we’ve previously expressed, one of our goals with wagering is to expand our total available market (TAM) by developing another important revenue stream for fuboTV, as we are doing with our growing ad sales business."" While I don't doubt the strong connection between sports wagering and Fubo's subscribers that enjoy streaming live sports, I question if the ad revenue investors are expecting will come to fruition.
* In April of 2020, Fubo announced the closing of their merger with the sports focused virtual entertainment company FaceBank Group. The CEO of Fubo had said, ""With today’s closing, fuboTV is well-positioned to redefine the virtual MVPD space. Technology-driven cable TV replacement services are more important than ever, especially at this time when people are staying safe at home watching television for needed information, entertainment and escape.” FaceBank is quite an interesting company and developed some unique projects such as the virtual Michael Jackson show at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. This deal not only marked an interesting point in the development of Fubo, but gave the company access to $100 million in funding in the form of a revolving line of credit. I wonder as to how Fubo will leverage the virtual reality and live-entertainment technology that they now control.

# Management

CEO - **David Gandler**

David was appointed as the CEO and director of Fubo in April 2020. He has been part of the team since 2015 when Fubo was simply a streaming soccer service. Prior to his role at Fubo, Gandler worked in the advertising industry for over 15 years at companies such as Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales, and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media. David has won a number of awards which includes *Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs* (2019), *Variety's Dealmakers* (2020,2019), and *Broadcasting & Cable's Power 100* (2017). David's vision for what Fubo could become is interesting and the first of its kind. Looking forward I hope to see Gandler scale this company and integrate their acquisitions successfully. Undoubtedly, David has a grand vision for what could become one of the largest sports betting and streaming companies.

Co-Founder/CMO - **Alberto Horihuela**

Alberto is the co-founder and chief marketing officer at FuboTV and is in charge of their branding, user engagement and retention, and overall marketing vision. Prior to his co-founding of FuboTV, Alberto was head of Latin America at DramaFever (a video streaming provider). Alberto has an entrepreneurial spirit as he also co-founded Primerad Network, a digital video advertising company that connected brand marketers to Latin American audiences. In addition to his experience in marketing and entrepreneurship, Horihuela worked as an economist and analyst at Morgan Stanley and DeMatteo Monness. Both Gandler and Horihuela have extensive experience in marketing, entrepreneurship, and media to which should serve this company well going forward.

Management not mentioned: Simone Nardi (CFO), Mike Berkley (CPO), and Gina Sheldon (general counsel).

# What could go wrong

**Fubo can't keep up with the competition** \- As previously stated, Fubo is up against some heavy competition. AT&T TV provides more channels at the highest subscription level, but Fubo still offers more sports. Also , FuboTV's DVR only lets you record 250 hours of content while AT&T TV lets you record 500 hours of content. YouTube TV and Sling TV are two other competitors that are well equipped to steal market share from Fubo. The main differences I see between Fubo and the rest of the pact have to do with cost and product focus. Sling provides the cheapest plan which starts at $35 and is compatible with many of the existing streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, etc. In terms of the rest of the cohort, they all provide plans that are priced similarly. In terms of the products they offer, Sling, YouTube TV, and AT&T TV haven't differentiated themselves like Fubo. When it comes down to it, sports fans should gravitate to FuboTV as they provide the largest sports network. We'll have to see how this all plays out in the coming years to get to know which companies emerge as the leaders.

**Fubo fails to turn a profit** \- While this risk factor applies to any company that isn't profitable, it's important to highlight how early this company is to having a profitable business model. In their last earnings for the twelve months ended December 31st, Fubo posted $184 million of subscription revenue and $204 million in subscriber related expenses. Thus, this company is not making money on their services and I can't quite predict when or if this company will be profitable any time soon. That's not to say Fubo is a terrible service, but rather their financial standing isn't one that currently strikes me as sustainable.

# What we want to see in the future

**Contribution margin increasing** \- As noted in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results, this company's contribution margin for 2020 was 10.1%. The contribution margin is the difference between subscriber revenue and what it costs Fubo to provide subscribers their service (ARPU - ACPU). While the contribution margin for this company sounds reasonable, the problem comes in when you factor expenses. Expenses such as sales and marketing, depreciation, technology and development, and a few others are hindering this company substantially from making a profit. Once you factor all the expenses of Fubo, they came in at an operating loss of $479 million. What we need to see from Fubo these next five years as they scale is them being able to at-least report a positive income from operations. Let's also remember that Fubo has a recurring revenue business model which means it is predictable and reliable.

**Fubo scales their sports gambling business** \- While this point is rather obvious, I wanted to note a few things about this side of Fubo's business so we can better understand it. Fubo has yet to roll out their sports betting business but they, ""expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year."" Certainly this is an exciting direction that this company is headed in. Although, we have no sort of guidance as to how this sports betting business will perform. CEO David Gandler was quoted saying, “We not only expect sports wagering to become a new line of business and source of revenue, but we also expect that it will increase user engagement on fuboTV resulting in higher ad monetization, better subscriber retention and reduced subscriber acquisition costs.” I like the way that David is thinking, but simply liking the idea doesn't make it a success. I can imagine investors will be eagerly watching how this venture performs in the first year of its integration. As for now, we don't really know what to expect.

# Analyst expectations

1. Predicted revenue range for 2021: $465.03 – 480.44 million (growth of roughly 110%)
2. Predicted earnings per share range for 2021 (EPS): $(2.5) – (0.82)

# TLDR

Fubo's vision to be a digital entertainment giant primarily focused on sports is innovative and unheard of. Their recent acquisitions of Vigtory and Balto Sports shows their commitment to making their goal a reality. While the CEO is thinking big, his ideas aren't translating well onto Fubo's financial statements. Their expenses have gone up at the same rate as their revenue has and that worries me. Additionally, this company isn't in the best cash position with $134 million. It's important to note that this company is still early in the process of what they're trying to accomplish and **I'll be keeping a close eye on how they perform this next yea**r. Their recurring revenue business model will surely serve them well in the future as it is predictable and reliable. You'll notice that the discounted cash flow is missing from this post and that is because forecasting this company's future growth is extremely difficult without some sort of idea as to what we can expect. As of right now, to put a price on this company is quite difficult.   


**In conclusion, I'll be watching Fubo's earnings this next year to get an idea of where this company is headed and if it's worth starting a position.**

Fubo doesn’t get enough credit for the market share they’ve been able to obtain the past couple years. You can say they can’t keep up with big names but going from 1 to 5% market share while spending relatively nothing on advertising is very impressive. While every other live streaming service tries to gain the attention from everybody, Fubo will focus on sports fans and will continue to be successful. 

I have the product and it’s fine. I literally have no issues with it and the app genuinely surprised me, the quality on matches was way better than I expected. Anybody that’s had issues always complains about buffering but doesn’t realize that it has nothing to do with Fubo and everything to do with the channel you’re on. Every live streaming service has that same issue. The only bear argument that actually has some merit is the fact that they are losing money right now, but profitability will come as their advertising revenue grows rapidly.",

\-it's used for combustion processes in metal production, so that will interrupt raw material productions (India's major metals productions are Iron and Steel)

mxlg2s,,wallstreetbets,post,1619275789,"DD on HYPRO (HydrogenPro) hydrogen company. Massive growth opportunities.Here is some DD on HYPRO. I hope to hear your thoughts on this, in my opinion, very bullish company.

1. HYPRO specialises in large-scale hydrogen production (100MW). They are in the midst of demonstrating their new patented technology which takes the efficiency of hydrogen production up to 94% compared to the rest of the hydrogen industry that is lagging behind at 80%. This technology is expected to be ready for the markets in 2022. They will have the best technology in the hydrogen sector. Massive. The EU is funding companies that are able to demonstrate efficient hydrogen production in the scale of 100MW production plants. HYPRO has applied for this funding and decisions concerning the funding will come this June. HYPROs technology will take the dollar price of producing a kilogram of hydrogen to 1,2dollars compared to EUs goal of finding someone who can produce it for 2,5€/kg of hydrogen. Almost hard to believe..
2. In Q4 of 2020 HYPRO made an operating profit, which is pretty unheard of in the hydrogen industry. Everyone else is taking losses.
3. HYPRO has no debt.
4. HYPRO just signed a deal with Hynion about supplying hydrogen to 30 hydrogen fueling stations that will be built in Scandinavia in the coming years. Hundreds of trucks delivering goods will be charged in these stations. HYPRO and Hynion in collaboration are the only ones providing hydrogen fueling stations in the near future and will have an advantage on everyone else.
5. HYPRO is in a huge dip and hasn´t soared 1000% like some other companies like PLUG.
6. They are helping energy giant Repsol to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. They are working on a 100MW hydrogen plant in Spain and many more projects may follow. 3 other plants are being constructed, 2 of which are in the US and 1 in France.

&#x200B;

Here is their most recent report on their website where most of my claims are from: [https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf](https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf)

Do your now research and let me know what you think! It's still a small company but to me that means a lot of growth potential. Weather you think hydrogen is the future or not, the EU has lots of plans in the hydrogen sector and the price of it is coming down fast. Up to 6GWs of hydrogen plants are to be built by 2024. HYPRO could take a good portion of that. The steel industry will also want to get rid of emissions when the price of pollution becomes greater than the price of switching to hydrogen.",

How does HYPRO solve the energy input problem in hydrolysis to lead to future cost lowering as they improve their process?

I like green energy, I like the idea of green hydrogen. Its just from a purely chemistry perspective it is massively inefficient to produce with current techniques. Something like nuclear on the other hand is more efficient than even fossil fuel, but with obvious safety and waste storage concerns.",

mx30pt,,wallstreetbets,post,1619205880,"I figured out how to prevent RobinHood from closing positions at 3pm on expiration date.Yes, RobinHood is awful but it's easy to use for my degenerate gambling account. My 'adult' account is elsewhere, no need to lecture me. That said, I've sorted out how RobinHood closes positions on expiration. I'll walk you through the rough logic on the server side, then explain how to keep them from closing positions you want to hold until close like a true degenerate. 

At 3pm EST their system starts the following sequences;

3:00 - Does user have an option expiring today that they do not have funds to exercise? If yes, cancel sell order and notify user.

~3:04-3:09 - Sell all options expiring today that are OTM and users do not have sell orders for, or are ITM but not enough buying power to exercise. Sell at bid.

3:10 - The process starts over, and repeats the previous process. 

This is every ~10 minutes as far as I can tell, until 15-20 minutes before close. At this point the process is restarted every 5 minutes roughly. 

So how can you hold something until close? Create a limit sell order above the bid, and as soon as you are notified that your order has been cancelled you need to create a new one. This will prevent the next step from being executed, and you can hold those options until the very end like a true degenerate.",

AMD   sells chips to a variety of sectors but you can mainly categorize it  into to two categories: Computing&Graphics and Enterprise ( Embedded   and Semi-Custom). Basically if there is a need for calculations they   make the chips.  As you might have noticed there has been a supply  shortage lately causing semi conductors prices to sky rocket- if you  have been trying to buy one lately you will know. So AMD is a part of a  mega trend and there is a clip of the psycho CEO mama who has been on Sir shithouse aka Cramer telling him it is good for business ( cant post the video but you can google ""AMD CEO gives update on Xilinx acquisition and talks chip shortage impact"")

The CEO mama Su is nothing short of a genius. PhD in electro engineering from MIT she has been running the show since 2014 where AMD was a mess. I shall not go into the accounting details but basically she knows her   stuff and the development of the stock price reflects just that

From 4 dlls a share to now be around 80

mx4ozj,,wallstreetbets,post,1619210737,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - April 19th to April 23rdWhat’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season is in full swing this week, and the markets were volatile. Boatloads of news, combined with a healthy amount of FUD was dropped this week, and I wasn’t around to observe the markets until Thursday, so this recap will be a little bit more bare than most. Apologies in advance. If you want a copy of the newspaper early, feel free to see the links on my profile! With all that being said, let's get into it.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, the media decided to spread some FUD regarding TSLA** after reports revealed that two people died after a driverless crash in Texas. TSLA shares initially slid 6%, until people pointed out that *literally nobody was driving the fucking car*, meaning that the owner purposely managed to bypass all safety measures in order to avoid outright driving the car. Fuk a weight sensor, fuk a seatbelt sensor, fuk a steering wheel sensor, and fuk the bears, buddy put a case of beer or something in the divers seat while he went to plow his Tinder date in the back seat. Despite this gut wrenching news, TSLA closed the week up 4%.

&nbsp;


- To add to the FUD on Monday, **The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill** if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March, *nearly two months ago*, during a treadmill accident. America really decided to snitch on PTON over some old old beef just to put my calls OTM, kill me man. This headline is extra stupid cause a small child and animal can die on ANY treadmill, not exclusively a PTON one. PTON never actually recovered, and closed the week down 7%. Guh.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, Netflix reported some disastrous earnings**. Netflix beat on earnings a bit, but then casually tried to slip in the fact that they lost nearly HALF of their yearly subscriber growth, reporting 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected. Obviously, investors were PISSED and Netflix plunged 10% on the week. To be fair, that’s what you degenerates get for sharing your Netflix passwords with your friends, y’all deserve this one. During the earnings call, CEO Reed tried to “urge investors to look beyond subscriptions"", as if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. NFLX did announce a healthy share buyback during the call, which is pretty awesome considering they just created a dip to buy. Cathie Wood, and CEO Reed were promptly seen religiously doubling down on their shitty investments.

&nbsp;


- Throughout the week, **random shit was mooning left and right, most notably SKLZ and MVIS**. No news announcements, no earnings reports, no catalyst. Just good ol fashioned market manipulation baby. MVIS saw $10.20 before closing the week up 80% around $18.00, while SKLZ followed closeby seeing $12.50 before closing the week up 50% at $18.50. I was eyeing skillz for weeks at this point but didn’t want to catch the knife until it settled. Ah well, live to trade another day I suppose.

&nbsp;


- On Thursday, the media was back to spreading FUD. According to a report by Bloomberg, **President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6%** to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. **When coupled with the 3.8% tax on investment income that funds the Affordable Care Act, federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%**. For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%. Although this news has already been known for a long ass time, it still tanked the markets 1% on the day. Algos reacting to humans reacting to algos, crazy shit. I can’t help feel like this entire situation was comedic as hell. Rich people make too much money, therefore we wanna increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy then immediately withdraw all money from the stock market and we’re left with retail traders left holding bags. Wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich. Mission accomplished.

&nbsp;


- **To those familiar with the [Lil Yachty Indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0975/lil_yachty_theory_goes_on/), this week was terrifying**. On 4/20, Lil Yachty released a hit single, causing the market to absolutely shit itself. Although the market managed to recover, the stress it caused wasn’t all that welcome, because the song itself was pretty dogshit. On top of all that, on Friday he also announced that he’s dropping a ***WHOLE ASS ALBUM***. Friday was a ripping green day, which is really fucking awesome, cause it means I got to liquid all my positions at an all time high. I hope you all followed suit, cause next week we’re gonna be blood red. Don't believe me? Search up ""Lil Yachty Crashes Stock Market"" on youtube for some definitive proof.

&nbsp;


- **There was a whole bunch of news this week that I didn’t have time to write about, but I encourage you to look into it** later if it interests you! I’ll summarize them all below. The U.K. government said it would probe **Nvidia** Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. Chat startup **Discord** Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including **Microsoft**, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, **Apple** announced a new slate of products set to include the company's own chip. **U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 547,000** in the latest week, below the 617 estimate and from 586,000 prior week. Continued claims fell to 3.674M vs. the estimated 3.667M.

&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Apologies for the shorter report this time round, I was extremely busy with work this week, and earnings season came with WAY too much additional news. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and come back on Monday rejuvenated for some more trading. Cheers 😎","['TSLA', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'NFLX', 'NVDA']"

This is the biggest streaming company in China and is avidly sought after by Tencent. Massive market and massive growth industry. Their PS is crazy low. The Price to Book Value is also fucking awesome for a growth tech company. Value investors look for companies less than 3 and this fits that parameter. This company is also jacked to the gills with cash. Check out their balance sheet. As of Q4 2020 their total assets are 12.4B and their total liabilities are 2.6B. They have 3.2B in pure cash. Year over year this company is putting out blow out numbers but their Q4 contracted a bit vs their Q3 of last year. But seriously: 3.2B in cash and the market cap is just over 4B. What kind of absurd mismatch is this especially when it is a money printing business too.

2) Technical/Price-Action/Analyst stuff:

https://preview.redd.it/fd1rs2zc80v61.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=282dd7d2b5b9fa97c54d1e208b0ea8408c560c08

6 Analysts projections: upper-bound is $29 and the median price target is $25.66. The stock jumped today a bit on news that the stock just got a buy rating: HUYA shares are trading higher after 86 Research upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a price target of $22 per share. We all know analysts are a bunch of pencil pushing idiots so take that with a grain of salt. Currently the price is $18.5 AH and it hasn't traded this low since July of 2020. The price was north of $35 as recent as a couple months ago. It has been consolidating at the $18 level waiting for news which brings us to the meat and potatoes of this post.

3: Proposed merger and Arbitrage strategy: The two biggest streaming companies in China are HUYA and DOYU. The King Maker aka Tencent is trying to merge these companies as they will dominate and have 80% market share if the merger is successful. Tencent has a major stake in both companies and a huge vested interest strategically as they are a video game company (among other things) and this would have vertical integration characteristics. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will be converted to .75 HUYA shares. The arbitrage strategy here is going long shares on DOYU and people shorting the hell out of HUYA. The amount of short interest on HUYA shows that the market is confident the merger will go through. If it DOESN'T go through then HUYA will no longer be shorted and the stock will sky rocket. If the merger DOES go through then you'll have a stake in the biggest streaming company in the biggest streaming market on planet earth.

4) Headwinds: China used BABA to send a message to monopolistic behavior. This was great news for the HUYA/DOYU merger because the uncertainty surrounding Beijeng's agenda was lifted a bit. Major companies, including Tencent, came out publicly to say they will make concessions where necessary. I expect this will hasten the negotiations between Tencent and Beijeng to get this through. The current time table for this merger to happen is the first half of 2021, which we are well on our way to the 2nd half. It is possible for this to happen in the 2nd half if negotiations stall. The other slight headwind is that DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling concerns but this is completely short run shit that gives me a better discount.

5) Institutional ownership: 52.4% of outstanding shares are owned by institutions. The two biggest players are ARK and Morgan Stanley. Fintel shows Morgan Stanley increasing their HUYA stake by 169% in the most recent filing to 22,095,743 shares (32% of the comany). Ark has the next most with 11,600,993 shares for 13.99%.

https://preview.redd.it/oba7mkdff0v61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4f7d12c4b41a9fb120152c75d58360a23ef1af3

6) Short Interest: Check the massive SI on this ticker.

https://preview.redd.it/il8yghtuf0v61.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=87cb84ae2a02fbc539db22278e83f03293229f14

34.4% of the float is shorted and 52.4% of the outstanding shares are owned by institutions. That leaves a fairly small left-over float size to publicly trade.

Mama CWood loves the stock. Massive institutional ownership with Morgan Stanley just making a huge investment. Pending merger. Artificially suppressed aka arbitrage short. I LIKE THE STOCK. I am playing the HUYA side with long calls and shares. It is a win win if the merger does or does not go through.

Edit: I just bought 1500 shares so you fuckers don't beat me to it like everything else

Synthetic Biology or Precision Fermentation is our ability to engineer living organisms to be machines. We've done it in the past with things like insulin, but this new wave is a brand new approach. In Amyris' case, the data from millions of iterations of proprietary DNA code are fed into an AI that can now create a 0-to-commercial scale strain all by itself without the input from a scientist ([See this webcast for more details](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2101/40812)). The strains are so optimized that in some cases the cost of production begins to approach the price of sugar. Its making the expensive/rare molecules in nature cheaper and more sustainable.

FAQ - why skincare? and why do they own these brands? - long story short they have disgusting margins because they produce the molecules themselves. Because they have the cheapest cost to produce their molecules they can sell them B2B and then B2C where they reap \~50x their cost to produce. Its free money for them.

&#x200B;

**""Competitors and Valuation**

Many of you reached out to me before and asked who the competitors were and they have both stepped into the light just this month - Ginkgo and Zymergen. There is plenty of space for all three of these synbio companies in the game but lets go over what sets them apart using our organisms to machines idea.

* Machines that make a product, keeping the machine and selling only products - Amyris' strength
* Machines that find new products to make - Ginkgo's strength
* Machines that are the product - Ginkgo and Zymergen's strength

Amyris is currently around 3-5 years ahead of Ginkgo who is probably 3 years ahead of Zymergen. Ginkgo and Zymergen need much more data which is why their focus is different. Amyris already has the data that allows them to jump to commercial scale so they can make these machines and keep them - **this is where the money is at**. The other two need to do a ridiculous amount of yeast engineering to get enough data for their AI to be useful, so they have to whore themselves out to feed their AI.

* [Ginkgo](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) is going live via SPAC at a $20B valuation, we don't have numbers yet but we think their revenues are around $100M/yr.
* [Zymergen](https://www.zymergen.com/) IPO'd yesterday and is at a 4B valuation, its revenues are $16M/yr
* **Amyris** has been floating at $4-5B market cap, its projected revenue this year is $400M. **It is a diamond that no one has noticed yet**. Buy it up ASAP.

&#x200B;

**Important things to understand in this field**

\-The value of micro organisms. Currently the value for a commercial scale strain is \~50M, so keep that in mind Ginkgo and Zymergen will be making some cash. The issue is they are selling their strains to do so - **be careful of these revenues**. In Amyris' case they create a commercial strain and rather than selling it, they build around it so that the strain can provide millions to hundreds of millions in reoccurring revenue.

\- ""Commercial Scale"" is bullshit. Let's take Cannabigerol (CBG) for example. CBG is around $10-$20k/kg probably closer to $10k these days. Companies will say they have hit commercial scale if they have a strain that can make it at anything under the product value. So all those companies that say they have produced CBG at commercial scale might be making it at $8000/kg that's still a 2k profit. Bu this is no where near optimized. Amyris specializes in ""optimized commercial scale"" (pushing strains to their theoretical limits), where the cost to make their products begins to close in on the cost of their feedstocks (the cost of sugar).

&#x200B;

**WTF happened to the 500M deal, why didn't we jump?**

**The Deal - Amyris sold their entire Flavor and Fragrances Business to DSM for 500M (upfront cash + royalties + blah blah)**

I'm gonna be real with you guys... it just looked really bad on the outside (but its an amazing deal after you dive deeper). The Flavor and Fragrance business for Amyris is what brought them back from the grave. They were almost completely under from pursuing biofuels. They pivoted to low volume high cost materials (Flavors + Fragrances) in order to stay afloat. Now that they are what they wanted to be - A Company that sells Molecules - they no longer need to run that business. It also had some pretty bad margins running that business. It was a means to an end. On the outside it looks like they were desperate and needed cash, but knowing the inner workings - it was just a part of their plan. They sold a 30M/yr business for 500M, expanded agreements to 15 years, got rid of bad margin products, and kept their strains (not 100% sure on this last part). It was a great deal.

**The Offering**

People freaked out about this, but all they did was dilute 3% for like 150M in cash... It caught me off guard, but I don't see this as a big deal especially not after all their acquisitions this year. Diluting 3% at the top is WAY different than 20% at the bottom.

**Good Luck**

I'm still holding all of my shares and buying more every month. My ranking is Amyris > Ginkgo > Zymergen. Amyris is just so far ahead, Ginkgo is a good bet later, and Zymergen is going to be lighting cash on fire for the next few years.",

Track 5 - **G.I. Joe** \- Long RTX, LTM, BA, DFEN, NOC. This is an obvious play you shouldn't need Yachty to elucidate for you.

Track 6 - **Never Did Coke** \- This is a short play on KO. Yachty thinks kids are more health conscious now, but his bearish sentiment on Coke long-term confuses me. I think they're well positioned for some CBD beverages and healthy drinks.

Track 8 - **Plastic** \- Long oil. This is a recovery play.

Track 12 - **SB5** \- If you google SB5 you get PROFUTURA. This is a bullish Latina futures play. GPROFUT

Track 13 - **Hybrid** \- He's saying short Tesla, as he prefers a hybrid to a full electric. Yachty is bullish on Detroit automakers. He seems to suggest he's made quite the bag off GM and FORD this year while fucking your little sister.

When Migos were about to come on, the crowd got crazy. Beautiful expensive women came out of the woodwork. All ass and tits and lips. Then they started making gunshot noises and the cops showed up and kicked everyone out. Spent the rest of the night on the docks in LI city watching Manhattan breathe in the distance tripping balls.

**Charts:**

On the **daily** candle charts, we can see an inverse head and shoulders pattern with the head at $68 and the neckline at $75. We can also see two back to back hammer doji candles indicating price wanting to move up. There is also a pennant forming which is a bi-directional pattern.

**Options OI:**

Taking a quick look at the nearest expiring monthly options, the strike with the largest OI is 80c with about $1.8MM in premium. The entire options chain is skewed to the bull side with a crap ton more overall bullish OI and bullish volume compared to the bear side. I'm too lazy to add up the numbers but you can do it yourself. I've highlighted the OI column if you wanna do math.

**Conclusion:** Looking at everything this bitch looks like it's about to explode. It's been consolidating for a long ass time. It looks like it want's to explode higher but time will tell if I'm right. Personally I think this is gonna hit $80, if I had to guess, somewhere in about 2 weeks.

Three days ago, HYLN was down like 17% since my first thread, and I know some of you dummies sold at the very bottom. I know this because some of you even told me as much.

>[Source](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrjjyo/hyln_pt_2_a_fair_warning/)

HYLN being in the red for no reason doesn't bother me. I'll explain *why*, but first I need you ass-scratch-and-sniffers to understand a term:

# Baskets, or why buying a winning company isn't always a free lunch

[**Basket**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket.asp) \-- A basket isn't just a prop you wear on your head to make your other 70 IQ friends laugh milk out of their noses. A basket is a collection of similar stocks that tend to trade together. Conspiracy theorist GMEanons used to perceive GME/AMC/BB all trading together to be ""evidence of market manipulation"" when in reality it was just algos buying and selling a collection of similar stocks because that's what algos do. ""They aren't similar though!"" said the GMEanons. They *were* \-- they were hyped up to massive valuations by a huge collection of retarded retail traders -- the vast majority of whom had no idea what they were doing, as evidenced by their not knowing what a fucking *basket* is if it's not made of wicker.

So *why* am I talking about baskets of the non-pic-a-nic kind, Booboo?

[This is why.](https://i.ibb.co/wh1GFXW/basket-SPACs.png) Look at those stocks. I even put them into a fucking basket so you could maybe hopefully understand it a bit easier. Take a minute to look at the picture and think about this question: What do they all have in common?

...

Yes, they're all in a basket, we already covered that. Anything else?... Nothing? Jesus Christ, your pattern recognition skills must place you in the sub-70 IQ category, fucking hell...

Let me spell it out for you: **THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PATTERN.** For the past month (and longer!) all of these stock shave traded roughly the same. Trading algos grouped them all together and since then these stocks have pretty much rode together and died together (more of the latter than the former). So why are they trading together?

1. They're all electric vehicle-related stocks. Three make cars, one make EV batteries. They're intrinsically similar, although they differ in the products they offer.
2. They are also all the result of a **SPAC** merger. This term, I believe, stands for ""**S**hitty **P**iece **'A** **C**rap"" stocks. They're called this because they were pumped more furiously than Austin Powers' member after being cryogenically unfrozen. I'm not even kidding -- if you zoom out on the 6 month on HYLN's stock chart, you'll see a perfect representation of a pair of balls and a big old chubby-stubby. This stock has **big dick energy**, my boys. Anyway, after they pumped like an antiquated sex-depraved 90s reference, they dumped faster than your grade 6 girlfriend dumped you after she found out you not only pick your nose, but you *eat the boogies too*. Fucking gross. You should've taken the cue and stopped doing that *then*. Anyway, they're shitty **stocks** because they got people to buy into hype and then sell into fear. [Hedge funds](https://i.ibb.co/fYsHcXF/citadel-HYLN.png) *love 'em. (*[Source](https://fintel.io/so/us/hyln)*).* If you want to know for real what a SPAC is, you can look it up yourself. I can't do all your homework *for* you, geez.  
(Note: shitty ""stocks"" does not necessarily mean shitty ""companies"")
3. They were all on the receiving end of short reports.

In this thread, I'm going to do a *very* basic comparison of the four companies mentioned above by looking specifically at:

* Their fundamentals (the dollars comin' in and the dollars goin' out)
* The short reports

# Fundamentals -- Don't be deceived, there's nothing fun about them

A company's fundamentals means the money coming in and the money going out. Fundamentals are notoriously boring to track, and would often involve people combing through beefy quarterly (10-Q) and annual (10-K) reports and alt-tabbing between them and an Excel spreadsheet that they would mash data into. Now, there's a better way of easily visualizing companies' earnings across quarters and years:

[Macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/) \-- this site is dope, but before you access it, I suggest you get familiar with the base-10 counting system. Maybe try attending some remedial classes at your local kindergarten until you're more familiar with double- and triple-digit numbers before you start perusing it.

Anyway, as we're looking at a **basket** (see that? that's called spaced repetition, and it's good for brain-learning) of pre-earnings growth stocks fresh off the SPAC, there's a few things specifically that are important to look at for these types of companies:

* **Cash** \-- I don't give many fucks about inventory; long-term investments; property, plant, and equipment. For an unproven company that will have some nasty-ass start-up bills to pay, cash is king.
* **Debt** \-- it's good to think about how start-ups are going to pay off debt, but I already checked and these four companies have no or next-to-no debt. We can ignore this one for now.
* **Net income** \-- as these companies are start-ups that are still ramping up production and incurring losses, we need to know how much money is going out of these companies. How much time do they have left before they need to raise funds through dilution, or worse -- before they implode?
* **YUIDDIAPRCB** \-- A term I totally didn't just make up right no, which stands for Years Until Insolvency, Dilution, or Debt Issuance, At Present Rate of Cash Burn
* **Market Cap** \-- the ""value"" of a company, as determined by complex algorithms developed by teams of computer scientists which track market sentiment, institutional and dark pool trading, and calculate and weigh probabilities of positive outcomes, as well as by guys named ""Matt"" who just started trading ""stonks"" after receiving a ""stimmy"", and who once tried to take a screenshot of a new crack on his phone screen after scratching his ass and then smelling his finger. Basically, it's calculated as (Number of shares in existence) x (Price of shares)
* **Market Cap (compared to HYLN as a %)** \-- because that's the stock I'm looking at, after all.

&#x200B;

|Company|HYLN|NKLA|RIDE|QS|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cash|608m|845m|630m|1b|
|Net income|\-39m|\-397|\-100m|\-1.1b|
|YUIDDIAPRCB|15.6 years.|2.1 years|6.3 years|<1 year|
|Market Cap|1.65b|4.92b|1.76b|13.1b|
|Market Cap vs HYLN (%)|100%|298%|106%|794%|

Now, it would be pretty retarded to look only at these numbers when analyzing a company. What if HYLN's product is Tits in the age of Asstagram, and QS is selling Big Ole Badonkadonks? Excellent point, zoomer. Well, I would venture so far as to say that **none** of these companies have proven, legitimate, and desirable products. Sure, each of them has *some* claim to credibility (well-known investors on the board, industry professionals serving as execs, product deals, etc.), but until they start producing and shipping in quantity, they're yet unproven. With that said -- does QS deserve to be valued 8x higher than HYLN despite having 1/16 of its ""lifespan"" at their current rates of cash burn? Not, IMO, when you consider the short reports.

# Short Reports: The only time being short pays off

As I mentioned, each of these companies has had a short report issued about them in the past few months, causing a pretty drastic drop in their share prices. Now, I know shorts have been unfairly demonized on WSB lately by people who only just learned what a ""short seller"" is a few months ago, and even then still can't quite truly wrap their head around what it means to sell a stock you haven't bought. In actuality, banning short selling has been found to be [unhealthy for the market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/restraints-on-short-selling-wouldnt-calm-markets-11584906733). The fact is, short sellers are actually healthy for the market -- **IF** they short **ethically**.

What does it mean to **short** **ethically**?

Ethical shorting means identifying fraudulent companies and punishing them for lying to or misleading investors. These companies often publish short reports -- information and intel that suggests that the targeted company may be misrepresenting their business in some way. Ethical shorters should be honest with their reporting. Yes, they *do* stand to make a profit off of people selling or joining them on their short-train (as opposed to the short bus with which you, dear reader, might be better acquainted). Still, if you identify substantial securities fraud and raise the alarm to ordinary investors, should you really be reviled for profiting from the resulting declining share price?

A writer for the [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jan-20-fi-petruno20-story.html) even referred to short sellers as ""\[maybe\] the last bastion of hard-nosed research left on Wall Street."" This was back in 2002 though, so he could never have anticipated the current golden-age of hard-nosed research that is WallStreetBets' stonks and updoots; rocket and diamond hands emoji spam; and Tendies and Golden Fuckboy awards.

If you're still not following, let me put it this way: If I had warned you all the way back in 2000, with very public and easily-accessible research, that Enron was a big scam, would I have deserved to be demonized for then profiting from a collapse in the company's share price? Of course not, because I would've been right -- it **was** a big scam, and I **did** warn people.

So now that we can agree that the ""short seller bad!"" monochotomy is fucking infantile, let's try a slightly more nuanced dichotomy:

* Some short seller **bad**
* Some short seller *good*

Now, let's break down the short reports for each of the above companies. I've saved the best for last.

&#x200B;

Now, I know ""length"" and ""titles"" aren't the best indicators of the quality and trustworthiness of a short report, but I *have* read parts of each of these short reports. However, I am but *one* man. I can't analyze, qualify, and verify every single assertion made therein. Suffice to say, they're all pretty damning IMO. All except for *one* \-- Hyliion's (naturally). And I *will* be analyzing, qualifying, and verifying every single assertion made about the company. Coming to a WSB near you. *Soon*. My final DD on HYLN^(\*).

^(\*for the foreseeable future, anyway. I mean, I can't think of anything else to write about the company so after my next thread, I'mma probably just chill for a bit.)

*Note: The short reports for NKLA, RIDE, and QS do a good enough job on their own of raising some red flags about these companies. Other writers have delved deep and written responses to these short reports -- some in support, others in opposition -- so if you're interested in those companies, I suggest you read those instead, because I'm not as knowledgeable on those companies. I'm really only focusing on HYLN. If anyone has any interest in analyzing the success rate of the above short groups, I'd be interested to know. I'll be sharing my research about Bonitas and their report on HYLN in the coming days. Stay tuned.*

# Summary: I've Used Up All My Creative Juice By Now So Just Take It Raw Edition

Basket stocks, fundamentals, short reports -- so what? What do we do with this information?

We use it to help contextualize our positions:

**""Boo, HYLN is down today.""**

Did anything about the company change? No? Then who gives a shit?

**""Yay, HYLN is up today!""**

Same question: Did anything about the company change? No? Then who give-- actually, **fuck it**, it's kind of nice to see the stock *not* go down 5 days in a row for once. Let me bask in this fleeting glow while I still can.

Anyway, my point is that price action alone is not great at determining the price of a company.  If these four fairly different companies can all trade together, there will certainly be pricing inefficiencies. HYLN needs to divorce itself from the rest of the pack before we can really see the stock take off.","['INTC', 'HUM', 'UPS']"

Not only does their product have to be better, it has to be so much better that a completely green solution won't hold a candle to it. That's a big ask. If this were 10 years ago I'd be all-in but I don't see how hybrid solutions could have a decent lifespan anymore.

mx0hf5,,wallstreetbets,post,1619198955,"Why it is time to take your profits on OCGNI have been following OCGN for months when they initially partnered with Bharat Bioscience and was initially extremely bullish and rode OCGN from $6 to 16 the first time. After doing more DD, there are too many risks for OCGN to be valued even at 2B.

* OCGN only makes money on Covaxin vaccinations in the US
* The 70% efficacy is significantly below both Pfizer and Moderna, which we already mass produce enough of to cover the entire population for as long as we need
* They still need EUA approval, which will take several weeks if not months, as there would still need to be an independent trial conducted in the US
* By the time their vaccine is maybe approved, 80%+ of people in the US would already be vaccinated
* Covaxin takes a long time to manufacture and OCGN still needs to develop the manufacturing facilities in the US to even start manufacturing
* The price of vaccine is low, like $10-20 total, the small margins then are split among OCGN and Bharat Bioscience(the company who developed the vaccine)
* They only make 45% of profit per vaccination in the US, only place where they can sell it, which is about\~$5 They would need 25 Million vaccinations a year just to make 125M, not happening
* They had adverse reaction issues they swept under the rug in India in order to fast track this to market

TLDR Even if OCGN gets EUA, it will take too long for them to get the vaccine to market in the US, the margins will be low, the market will be saturated, and their efficacy is lower than American competitors.

The US will be hitting this out of the park, meaning that even with a population reaching herd immunity/a majority of citizens vaccinated, they will choose to stockpile vaccines. Covaxin has a better shelf life and better storage conditions that the mRna vaccines.

This is conjecture, but couldn't Ocugen be tapped to help supply this part of the world with vaccines in the future? They won't just be a distributor but also a manufacturer.

mwwt2h,,wallstreetbets,post,1619188962,"End of Week Market Report: Week of Friday, 4/23/2021Hello Traders and Investors! What a week right?! So many stories and earnings! Here is my weekly recap which I share every Friday to help to wrap your head around these markets! Feel free to DM me any of your questions and happy trades! 

The S&P 500 opened at $4138.78 today, lower than its previous Friday’s close of $4185.67 and its 52 week high of 4,191.31. Recovery from COVID has seen significant gains in the market as prices pull back from last week’s all-time-highs. 

Reports released Thursday that President Biden could propose a capital gains tax increase to 39.6% on individuals earning $1 million dollars or more, nearly double the current nominal rate of 20%. Additionally, a 3.8% investment tax currently exists to fund Obamacare. This potentially pushes the tax rate 43.4% which conflicts with long standing tax practices that have historically seen investment income lower than labor taxes. Such an increase seeks to address long standing notions of wealthy individuals paying lower tax rates than middle and low-income workers, a sentiment that President Biden campaigned on and championed. 

Members of the GOP suggest the increase will halt economic growth, leading those affected to hoard assets in order to avoid the tax. It is unclear if these claims will hold water, as historically there has been a low correlation between increases to the capital gains tax and the market. In 2013 the S&P experienced stellar growth of 30% despite an increase to capital gains tax of over 86%. 

Jobless claims dropped more than 7% from last week according to the Labor Department. This coincides with robust gains in the market as a whole as the country recovers from last year’s COVID pandemic. Current job loss from pre-COVID era still hovers around 8 million. Increase in national vaccine rollouts, averaging 3 million per day, should expedite this recovery. Approximately 40% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  
Several major travel companies reported earnings this week. This includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean. The International Air Transport Association has commented on the situation, citing potential losses in the sector of $48 Billion for the 2021 fiscal year. These numbers are over a 25% increase from previously released estimates of $38 Billion. Although significant, losses are down significantly from last year, where the industry suffered a $126.4 Billion loss in the wake of COVID shutdowns. 

American Airlines posted dismal earnings of -$5.54 per share Thursday. A spokesperson for American Airlines said the company is spending around $30 Million per day in operations costs, despite reducing annual operating costs by $1.3 Billion. The company continues to consolidate and revealed it expects to reduce its workforce by 1,600 in the coming months. In addition, American Airlines reportedly reached a deal with Boeing to delay delivery of twenty-three 737 jets for up to 3 years. American Airlines posted revenue of 4.01 Billion, just under half of it’s posted revenue only a year ago. Airports are functioning at around 60% of their capacity. 

""We continued to excel in growing customer relationships in our market focus areas of mobility, fiber and HBO Max,"" said AT&T CEO John Stankey in reference to a favorable Q1 Earnings report for the communications giant. Q1 Earnings reports reveal an excellent quarter for the company, who continues to grow in cell-service subscribers. AT&T also posted favorable results for its HBO Max service, which it received in its 2018, $85 Billion acquisition of Time Warner. 

A Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people over the weekend. The car was suspected to have been functioning on Autopilot by investigators as it was found with no occupant in the driver’s seat. Tesla has revealed that they have no data that suggests the vehicle was on Autopilot during the crash at this time Tesla did not rule out the possibility that further investigation may reveal the vehicle was in-fact on autopilot, but declined to make any additional comments at this time. 

Discord, a popular chat application developed for gamers, has ended months-long acquisition talks with tech giant Microsoft. Market Valuation of Discord has skyrocketed to $10 Billion from last year’s June valuation of $3.5 Billion. This comes at a time where many social media platforms are looking to develop and integrate chat functions in a way to capture user engagement and capitalize on the increase in remote work. Discord now intends to stay independent and pursue an IPO. 

The decision by Discord comes as Salesforce looks to acquire Slack in Q2 ‘21 for $27 Billion. Slack operates a chatroom not unlike Discord, but targeted at businesses as opposed to consumers. The acquisition is currently pending a U.S. Justice Department probe that will determine whether or not it will continue. Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Discord on the heels of Slack’s pending acquisition is likely a response to increased competition for Microsoft from Salesforce in the B2B and B2C technology markets. 

Netflix reached 208 million subscribers in Q1, just missing its projection of 210 million. The tech giant blames this miss on societal normalization as COVID regulations ease and more people return to work. Quarantine mandates saw a massive increase of 16 million new subscribers in the early months, and just over 10 million between April and June of 2020. In contrast, January through April of 2021 saw only 4 million new subscribers.  Regardless, the streaming giant reported an earnings per share of $3.75, versus $1.57 the year prior, which beat Wall Street predictions. Netflix’s 2020 subscriber boom showed massive financial gains in revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Q2 forecasts project a slight correction to this growth due to job growth and general societal rebound.

So, I picked one of the worst offenders, $LADR, and bought puts.\***

*Note: This is my first true DD here. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. This is only my opinion about the stock and any action you take based on my opinions is done at your own risk. In my opinion, I do not like this stock.*

***1.*** ***Intro***

Greetings Apes and Apettes! I'm excited and a little scared to post my first DD here. I learned of WSB like many of you and have been commenting and trying to be a good ape since January when I jumped on the GaymeStonk hype train. While I knew quite a bit about the market due to my work and education, I will admit that my investment strategy up to this point has been ""buy Vanguard Index Funds."" Safe, but boring. Being a part of this community has pushed me to go out of my comfort zone and finally make an ape gamble on something other than buying GaymeStonk shares.

So, I've been reading your DDs, watching the financial news, and just generally paying more attention to the markets in search of my first options play. I need to earn my stripes, one way or another, and I have found my first target: [$LADR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LADR?p=LADR).

***2.*** ***The Target: $LADR***

**Ladder Capital Corp** is a REIT traded on the NYSE with a market cap of just under 1.5BN. It's not a huge company by any stretch and options volume is a little low, but hopefully not so low that this post gets clipped. The company was started after the 2008 crash by three former executives who all worked for an internal real estate hedge fund at UBS. That HF collapsed after making investments in the subprime housing market. **I'm sure they learned their lesson and vowed** ***never to do that again***. RIGHTTTTT.

In fact, what they're doing now is *probably worse*, though the fallout may not be on the same scale as what happened in 2008. After all, the entire CMBS market is only **\~$500B**, as opposed to the residential housing market at \~**$8T** just before the crash (btw, current housing market sits at \~**$35T** \*\*\*whistles\*\*\*)**.** So, even if the entire CMBS industry goes tits up, we're not looking at a complete economic meltdown like we had in 2008, *unless it causes other dominos to fall, but that's another topic..*. Anyway, we can still make money if the thesis is correct, right? So, read on, dear apes.

What set me down this path was [this recent article](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/), which someone coincidentally linked in a GaymeStonk thread. Weird, I know, but take a read if you have a few minutes as it forms the basis of my thesis.

Reading this article first is sort of putting the cart before the horse, but the main point is that [Professor John M. Griffin](http://www.jgriffin.info/bio/) from UTA, decided to do a forensic analysis of claims made by an SEC whistleblower and found those claims to be **correct**. The claims will be discussed in one second, but just know that this guy's specialty is ""*forensic finance, or understanding the role of anything that is potentially illegal, illicit or immoral in financial markets*."" If you want to read the actual paper Mr. Griffin published, you will definitely develop some extra brain wrinkles. The paper can be found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162). It's a good, but technical, read.

Anyway, according to Griffin, the worst offenders when it comes to income overstatement are shown on the right side of this graph:

[Most of these companies, especially the shadow banks, \\""above the line\\"" are probably decent put plays](https://preview.redd.it/jjhp7uzafxu61.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=beaccc420be5712dfa89752d34f5e9586c8d26c6)

*Smol aside*: *I was curious if John Griffin and Kenny Griffin from Shitadel are related or if it's pure coincidence that they have the same last name. I can't find anything saying they are related, so let's chalk it up to a common last name. That said, it appears that Shitadel thinks $LADR is garbage, too, as* [*they have been getting rid of their shares and have purchased substantial additional puts*](https://fintel.io/so/us/ladr/citadel-advisors-llc)*. I feel dirty that I may be on the same side of a bet as Kenny G, but what's an ape gonna do???*

Anyway, the genesis of the Griffin study was a 2019 SEC whistleblower complaint that is discussed in this Pro Publica article from  **May of 2020:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds). The article describes a complaint filed by [John Flynn](https://commercialobserver.com/2018/07/john-flynn-cmbs-transparent/), [a veteran of the CMBS industry](http://creloanadvisors.com/), which alleges rampant overstating of borrower income to prop up shitty loans that were packaged into CMBS by 14 major lenders including Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and our target Ladder Capital Corp. The world renowned plaintiff's class action attorneys at **Quinn Emanuel** have taken note of the impending CMBS market correction and issued a very detailed and easy to read [firm memo](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/publications/us-outlook-potential-cmbs-litigation-arising-from-the-2020-downturn/) on the subject, which explains the myriad ways this thing could fall apart.

Anyway, $LADR isn't just taking loans originated by unrelated mortgage loan officers from various banks around the country and packaging those up into shitty CDOs. No no; they are **originating the loans themselves** and then packaging those crap loans together with other, better looking loans, and then **securitizing the garbage for their customers in an inflated CMBS.** I shit you not. Seems weird to risk your reputation by selling crap, but more on that later.

On top of the above, the firm appears to be engaging in some pretty shady practices when repackaging loans acquired from other lenders that had been part of a previous a CMBS that was unwound. Flynn's whistleblower complaint states that Ladder has been revising the previous income statements of the borrowers such that their **net profits were overstated anywhere from 10-30%** from what was reported by the prior lender, meaning they were given much larger loans than they are capable of paying off.

All of this just screams SHORT THIS SHIT, but if you want another reason to hate on Ladder, and I'm not trying to make this political, note that one of Ladder's largest investors is **Steven Ross.** If you don't know him, let's just say he's a billionaire BFF with 45 and, get this, Ladder is [one of the Trump organization's biggest creditors.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/09/billionaire-stephen-ross-holds-stake-in-one-of-trumps-biggest-creditors/?sh=7a2848863af4) Whatever you think about Trump as a President, one thing we know for certain is that he's [not that great at real estate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)**. Seriously, don't make this political**. This is about *fraud and bad bets in the CRE market*, not politics.

The final point I will make here is that the outlook for CRE for 2021 is just not that good overall, to say nothing of the CMBS market. The [National Association of Realtors is predicting](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-q4-commercial-real-estate-trends-and-outlook-survey-01-21-2021.pdf) Q1 2021 CRE prices ""to decrease in the office market (-3% y/y), retail (-6% y/y), and hotel/hospitality (-6% y/y)."" Guess what markets $LADR is heavily invested in? That's right; [office, retail, and hospitality](https://s2.q4cdn.com/455099226/files/doc_downloads/company_overview/2021/03/Ladder-Capital-Company-Overview-(March-2021).pdf).

***3. Timing***

So, this shit is shady and Ladder seems ripe for a fall, along with the rest of the CMBS market. In fact, I think you could make this bet against most of the offending lenders identified in the Griffin study, but especially against the shadow banks like Ladder. Thus, the real question is; **when lambo**???

This is a REALLY tough question and where this play certainly opens the door to either major gain or major loss porn. ***Please, only bet what you're able to lose***.

The problem, of course, is that the market was made aware of this malfeasance when Flynn filed his complaint **in February 2019**. Flynn was under the assumption that 10 year commercial loans sold in the run up to 2008 crash would be defaulting in 2017-2018, but that didn't happen. From the Quinn Emanuel memo: ""*Commercial loans backing CMBS typically have a shorter term than the residential mortgage loans backing RMBS, and a different amortization schedule. For example, a standard CMBS loan will have a 10-year term during which it will pay mostly interest and very little (or no) principal, with a large “balloon” payment of principal at the end. Often, the loan is refinanced at the end of its term, meaning that some or all of the balloon payment becomes the subject of a new loan, with a new term, which is frequently then secured in a new CMBS.*"" So, when the original CMBS 1.0 loan defaults didn't show up in the market, Flynn started digging and found that the original loans had simply been repackaged and papered over to new investors based on the **newly restated and inflated NOI** numbers, which triggered his SEC complaint.

But, the SEC hasn't acted on the complaint (AFAIK) and the market just didn't give a shit. Oh yeah, his complaint isn't actually public, either. What's more, Feb 2019-Mar 2020 was a banner year for CMBS returns and commercial real estate in general. Further, most analysts of the CMBS market agree that the new ""CMBS 2.0"" market is much healthier than the CMBS 1.0, i.e. pre-2008, market, so ***there's a chance I am completely wrong on this***.

All that said, the $LADR stock price did plunge from its ATH of $19 in Feb 2020 to about $3 in March 2020 due to the **COVID scare** that caused a broader market downturn at that time, but it has steadily inched back up to where it is today, at around **$11**. How can that be if their business is built on a pack of lies?

Well, as the Pro Publica article mentions, the Fed [threw a bunch of money at the CMBS market via the CARES Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm) last April (PPP, mortgage forbearance, etc.), which likely kicked the can down the road. And while Biden's recent **$1.9T** **American Rescue Plan** doesn't contain any *direct support* for the CMBS industry, it's clear that the QE provided by that plan will likely push any widespread CMBS correction further into 2021 or 2022. This aligns with some speculation by the Motley Fool (\*throws up a little\*) back in June that people should keep their eyes open for CMBS failures ""[over the next 12 to 24 months](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/articles/cmbs-fraud-allegations-propublica-and-industry-veteran/)."" There's also an outside chance that the [2020 Hope Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7809?r=98&s=1), which ""*establishes an equity facility in the Department of the Treasury to assist commercial mortgage borrowers*,"" could still pass and kick this failure can further down the road.

All that said, my prediction is that we'll likely see a *short term uptick* in the CRE market as businesses come back on-line following the easing of COVID restrictions, but this won't be enough to save the market from bad underwriting. The [Griffin study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) supports this when it says, on page 4, that ""*the difference between dubious and duteous originators will persist after the current COVID crisis.*"" So, we'll eventually see the house of cards collapse and I'm going to bet it does so **by the end of this year or early next year**. Now, if there is some wider market correction \*\*\*cough CLO/Treasury collapse\*\*\*, this could all happen *much sooner*. Note, the farthest out you can buy puts on this stock is 12/17/2021. \*\*\*sad trombone\*\*\*

I will also be paying close attention to the $**LADR** **Q1 earnings release on May 3, 2021.** Current EPS consensus is .08/share, which is the same as it was for Q4 2020, but which the company missed by .03/share (actual EPS was .05/share). Note, the company issued a dividend of $.20/share in the lead up to their Q4 2020 earnings report, and they have [done the same for Q1 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladder-capital-corp-announces-first-201500466.html). Accordingly, I'm also predicting **a** **30% miss on EPS for Q1 2021**, just like Q4 last year. I don't anticipate, however, that this EPS miss will have a huge impact on share price. Might drop it a buck or so in the short term. The real fall will come when their shitty loans start going bad later this year.

***4. Target Price***

As far as price goes, this is where I get out of my depth. I am just not equipped to crunch all these numbers from the articles and read financial statements and all that shit in order to say the company is going to drop by X%, so I'm just going with my gut feeling here. **I would really love some help on this point from some wrinkly brain apes who are good with numbers.**

So, I'm just going to look at what happened to the stock back in March 2020 and say that it will probably happen again when the shit hits the fan; ***the price will drop to around \~$4-5/share.***

***5. Counterarguments***

So, there are obviously a lot of counterarguments on which I would be happy to get some feedback. I have considered these, but maybe not weighted them strongly enough, in drawing my conclusions. I welcome your comments and criticism on these and any other counterarguments I may have missed:

* Even if $LADR is chronically overstating the income of their borrowers, the value of **the underlying real estate may be sufficient collateral** to stem any losses from widespread defaults.
* **Most analysts are bullish on this stock**, with the consensus rating now being to **buy**. Current analyst price target range is $12.50 - $14.00 with **an average of $12.80/share**.
* As the Intercept article posted above notes, Ladder's ""[three largest tenants are Dollar General, BJ’s, and Walgreens.](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)” This is good for Ladder given the current inflationary economic environment as consumers are looking for ways to save money and discount retailers benefit from this. In fact, Dollar General is having an amazing year. Their stock price has gone up about [55%](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/DG#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--) from **$140** following the March 2020 crash to **$218** yesterday. So, **if Ladder's largest tenants continue to do well, Ladder may be able to absorb/mitigate any loses** from their poor underwriting for other borrowers.
* **Ladder's business is not limited to CMBS origination and securitization**. They also are a commercial landlord, which could, again, offset any losses from their CMBS shenanigans.
* **Ladder won't be holding the bag** if these CMBS fail; *their investors will*. As the Flynn study notes; ""*the loan originator is not paid according to the loan’s future performance, but from fees and markups when the loan is sold... \[Accordingly,\] originators and underwriters may have incentives to build and burn their reputation.*"" So, there's always a possibility that **these securities fail, but** **Ladder survives**.

***6. Closing***

Boy, if you've read this far, I really appreciate you and would welcome your thoughts and criticism.

I feel pretty good about this thesis, but not good enough to YOLO, since it's my first time doing something like this. In fact, I've only made a very small investment by purchasing the following Puts:

* 20 x 12/17/2021 $7.50p @ $.25/share

If I'm correct, my potential gain is **\~900%:**

|Cost of Contracts (20 contracts @ .25/share = 2000 shares x .25 = $500) + $20 commission|$520|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of 2000 shares @ $5 price target|$10,000|
|Right to sell 2000 shares @ $7.50 strike|$15,000|
|Profit from share sale|$5,000|
|Profit minus cost of contracts|$4,480|
|Total Return (4480/500)|**896%**|

Yes, a \~$4.5K profit on a $500 investment is **small potatoes**, but I want to dip my toe in the water and see if my ape brain is working properly before taking bigger risks.

Let me know what I missed, fellow apes and, again, thanks for reading!

>""It's good to be a bull during a bull market, but nothing compares to being a bear during a bear market"" — Warren Buffett

  
Greetings, honorable WSB citizens. I've been playing with SPY and indexes recently, and it led me to formulate an interesting outlook on the current state of the market. I am really curious about what [noble WSB gentlemen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/) have to say on all these findings, so feel welcomed to engage in the discussion upon reading the post.

Compulsory, this is not a financial advice, and I am not an advisor - more than that, I am almost confident that I don't even know what I'm doing.

&#x200B;

P.S. Commenting ""Stonks only go up"" as a counter-thesis is perma 🌈🐃  


# I. The Abstract

&#x200B;

The main purpose of this work is to provide a technical counter-thesis to the current market craze, and to spark a constructive discussion. As it was mentioned in the post title, the tools that were used for creating this TA on SPY include: market cycles analysis, for setting a suitable framework; Elliot waves theory as a method of ordering major market movements; Fibonacci retracement for identifying the key, magnetic support and resistance levels; and a sweet 150 moving average to predict the potential bottom of the bear market. These tools will also be given a deeper explanation in the beginning of the discussion, for a bigger circle of WSB participants to wrap their brains around the technical factors at play. If you consider yourself to be a trader with sufficient technical knowledge and skills, feel free to skip the part II. The third part will be focused on the technical data accumulation, based on the historical examples from different time periods, and for different markets types. Part IV is the juiciest, as it incorporates the thesis formation through the application of all the data accumulated in the process of the analysis. V is a bonus part. Without further ado, let's get started.

&#x200B;

# II. The Technical Core

&#x200B;

1. **Market Cycles**

[S&P 500 example is used to illustrate market cycles: orange rectangle highlights accumulation phase, blue - mark-up, turquoise - distribution, and red stands for the mark-down](https://preview.redd.it/8hqda630diu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0c94fecc97785e480b47ef1a6a36448edf7edf8)

Cycles appear in many aspects of life; ranging from the very short-term, e.g. the life cycle of a June bug, which lives only a few days (like an average WSB participant's portfolio), to the life cycles of planets and galaxies, which take billions of years.

No matter what market the reference is being made to, the phases are usually not too difficult to identify, and these are cyclical: rise, peak, dip, and then bottom out (and not rise, rise, rise, and rise as many financial experts here strongly believe). As the consequence of the cyclical nature, when one market cycle is finished, the next one begins.

To see how this works on the financial markets, check the SPY cyclicality on the chart provided above (and for a deeper explanation of each phase, just duckduckgo 'market cycles' and click the first link - this should do well).

&#x200B;

2. **Elliot wave principle**

[Impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 \(purple\) and corrective A-B-C \(burgundy\) Elliot waves applied to the Silver 2019 bull rally and the subsequent correction, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/3159lojsciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6325a7df3af7ffa1a9f4e9d92c045e19cec5517)

Good old Elliot! The smart accountant guy, cherished by many technical traders, created his analytical tools as far back as in the 1930s. He discovered and developed the principle that a market moves according to collective investor or 'crowd' psychology, swinging between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences (which can be analyzed with the application of structural wave patterns). Such sentiment swings result in patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale (akin fractals). 

The wave theory is a complex subject in itself, with many advancements and different wave structures. For the purposes of this analysis only the core principles of impulsive and corrective waves patterns will be used, in order to not over-complicate the process. The fundamental idea behind the Elliot principle is fairly simple, follow Wiki explanation, applying it to the example chart above (Silver):  


>In Elliott's model, market prices alternate between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend. Impulses are always subdivided into a set of 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.

Furthermore, each wave has its own additional rules and guidelines, which will be mentioned later in the analysis. What should also be noted at this point, is that Mr. Elliot was careful to specify that these patterns do not provide any kind of certainty about future price movement, but rather, serve in helping to order the probabilities for future market action.

&#x200B;

3. **Fibonacci retracement**

[Fibo application, NASDAQ weekly chart: pay attention to how the price action plays nicely with the Fibonacci levels](https://preview.redd.it/0ur1l80kciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1f45c8fab9bf03f9daebaf9054b2952f9571ee7)

Leonardo Bonacci is another important name for any technical trader. It is no wonder, because Fibonacci retracement, as a method of technical analysis, is considered to be one of the most popular techniques for determining support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci retracement tool plots percentage retracement lines based upon the mathematical relationship within the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci retracement is based on a core idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they will continue to move in the original direction. Again, follow Wiki explanation, checking out the NASDAQ chart above:   


>Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios. 0.0% is considered to be the start of the retracement, while 100.0% is a complete reversal to the original part of the move. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels. The significance of such levels, however, could not be confirmed by examining the data. Arthur Merrill in Filtered Waves determined there is no reliably standard retracement: not 50%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, nor any other.

  
And that is the case! From my own experience, there is no ultimate, universal, favorable to the market Fibo correction level, applicable to all the charts and time-frames. However, as it will be observed and discussed later, many of the cycles' examples addressed will point at 61.8% and 78.6% levels, that is worth keeping in mind.

&#x200B;

4. **150 Simple Moving Average**

[The same chart as in the Fibo example, but here the 150 MA is applied; as it can be seen, the correction bounces off it](https://preview.redd.it/dnjkrx9eciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b819b20afea7aef8363cc6ce06e5f8a3e773a33b)

The simple moving average (SMA) is a straightforward technical indicator that is obtained by summing the recent data points in a given set and dividing the total by the number of time periods. In trading, the moving averages are used to identify the direction of a trend, as well as potential support and resistance levels (and that's how it will actually be utilized in the thesis). It can be computed for different types of prices, i.e., low, high, close or open - and personally, I usually work with the close price.

Moving averages are a matter of personal taste and preference. For example, for the short term trades and analysis I use 21 moving average, and it works like a charm. The MA that is of an interest for this technical thesis - is the 150 close simple MA. As for the long term trends, it seems to work as a strong correction magnet for the bears' run, as well as an ultimate support for the long term uptrend, as you should see yourselves in the examples that follow.

&#x200B;

# III. The Historical Examples

&#x200B;

Allrighty, now lets play with some of the major market cycles examples, applying the TA techniques described above in order to identify potential parallels, similarities/differences and to accumulate some data before jumping to the current SPY cycle. All of the charts in III are monthly charts.

&#x200B;

1. **Dow Jones 1994-2003**

https://preview.redd.it/eiw0sae6ciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad8f837d4135ce4d2caf2f24bcdd3052fae477d0

Starting with the cycles, the pattern is fairly obvious: accumulation (always highlighted orange) in 1994; followed by the upward trend (that is the mark-up stage) 1995-1999; what should really draw your attention here, is this fat and long distribution phase, in turquoise, lasting for about two years (this is exceptionally long, as will be seen with other comparisons); the cycle is closed with the year and a half long bear market, that is the mark down phase.

Then, take a closer look at this beautiful motive phrase wave that resembles a perfect TA book example. For the purple impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 wave there are, always, three cornerstone parameters, that have to be confirmed in order for the wave analysis to work out properly:

&#x200B;

* Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1 (✅)
* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5 (fat ✅, 3 is fucking huge here)
* Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1 (✅✅)  


Then, the most interesting piece, the bear market. Several observations to be made here: A-B-C corrective wave looks fairly ordinarily, though, typically C wave exceeds A wave to a good proportion, and in the current scenario A and C look almost like twins; the due attention should be paid to 150 MA, which acted as a strong support in this case, creating the foothold for the next accumulation phase and subsequently turning the bearish market into a bullish one. The MA acts together with the 61.8% Fibo retracement - another strong supportive factor.

*Overall, a good example of a balanced market cycle with the exceptional distribution phase + interesting Fibo 61.8% and 150 MA tandem support play for the bear market bottom.*  


Now, starting from the next chart, I will only concentrate on the crucial points. Which means, that you should do your wrinkle-less brain a favor and go through the following checklist off your own bat: identify and analyze the cycles; come back to the DJ 1-2-3-4-5 wave criteria if necessary and practice applying it to the other charts; check the Fibonacci retracement, how it fits and how the waves play with it - many interesting discoveries to be made in that relation. And finally, pay a lot of attention to bear markets: how these start, the steepness, A-B-Cs development, and how Fibo and/or MA save the day. It is also a good idea to apply your own technical outlook spidey senses and compare the charts provided. Feel free to share the findings! 

&#x200B;

[Fucking Ricardo Milos appears out of fucking nowhere and hands you:](https://preview.redd.it/8cbnni3rbiu61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2056cf0004b4cd1c2ece261e10471887d4db8069)

[a memo of Elliot waves characteristics.](https://preview.redd.it/6wezltfxbiu61.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b9178c969024c6d3bb8377be188994ffaedbc57)

&#x200B;

2. **DAX 2003-2009**

https://preview.redd.it/0q3k1608diu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c19967cfe7e52d271716ab4190ad7fc1db41205

Going further, lets take a look at DAX 2003-2009 cycle. Remember the checklist, run through that quickly yourself: cycles stages, waves, Fibo and MA.

When analyzing the growth stage manifested by 1-2-3-4-5, *take a note of the first wave, that kicks 78.6% Fibo, and is temporarily held by it - this happens often, and is easily identifiable on many of the exemplary charts. Pay closer attention to the play and the structure of wave 1 here, as it really is a good example of how it should look*. Checking 3 and 5 then - these are big, fat and extensive, and the muscular bulls are to be given credit for that.

What I also feel like pointing at, is the demolishing A-B-C correction, orchestrated by such as muscular bears. The impulse itself is extremely steep, and the full structure resembles a cutthroat dagger - literally, figuratively, visually and even in fucking vibes. Wave A almost touches 38.2% support, B wave bounces from it with a Jedi flick, and is reversed by 23.6% (*take a note of A💛38.2%, B🧡23.6%*) into a dagger blade C wave. The bears are so powerful at this impulsive C wave correction stage, so they are able to crush through 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 150MA altogether, only to be stopped by the support of a last resort (not without a fight), that is 78.6%. Next, the eight month consolidation (re-accumulation) was happening under 150MA and in between 61.8% and 78.6%, just to powerfully revert the price action back to the bullish trend, and the next bull run started. *It can be said that the 150MA, 61.8% and 78.6% played as a delicious bait for bears, for which the three were almost torn to shreds, but hedl.*

One more thing here. Comparing the current example with the A-B-C wave from the DJI example above, the following point has to be mentioned. If you may recall, A and C in DJ were almost identical. With DAX, C is how I like it. *Remember, C is typically at least as large as wave A and very often extends to 1.618 times wave A or beyond* \- which is the current case.

*Important Waves TL;DR: 1💙 78.6% Fibo, while A💛38.2%, and B🧡23.6%. C🗡*23.6%/38.2%/50%/61.8%/150 MA while 💙*78.6% (check the other charts for these points).* 

&#x200B;

3. **GOLD 2005-2016**

https://preview.redd.it/xdf6ducxziu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb241f0f72a2d1fc6038a25e40dceceba552ab85

The next chart to look at is a famous gold rally. Another important parameter of 1-2-3-4-5 is worth mentioning at this point: *2 and 4 usually have the following interdependence - if the second, corrective wave is flat, the fourth wave tends to have a sharper structure and vice versa*. This principle is illustrated and supported by the chart above. Furthermore, take a look at 3 and 5, which are massive again. This indicates that the bulls are really powerful in this cycle.

Talking about the A-B-C correction, it can observed that again A💛38.2% Fibo. Moreover, this time the retrace level magnetizes the price action firmly, so that the subsequent B wave and a substantial part of C wrap around 38.2% level. The three year correction phase morphs into the accumulation, which is supported by the 50% retracement. Interestingly enough, the lows occurring during this consolidation follow the slope of 150 MA, signalling its supporting power.

*Overall, we see a powerful bullish trend, followed by a relatively lengthy distribution phase, followed by a mild correction to 50% retracement, which proves bulls to be fundamentally strong in this market. Even though 150 MA seems to act as an invitation to bears initially, at the end of the day it is on the bulls side, protecting 61.8% and 78.6% from the bothersome honey lovers, and making them scared just by its look alone. And yeah, almost forgot, 1💙 78.6% Fibo.*

&#x200B;

4. **WTI 2002-2009**

https://preview.redd.it/la6h991b0ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80537e5a774b8bc3814b19a36565d388f4aa994d

Ooh, the fifth wave looks just crazy on this chart, and that is in the nature of volatile markets such as WTI. There are several points of interest for the reader in this example. The noticeable one, is that there is no obvious distribution phase on the chart above. That is, again, the nature of volatility - *sometimes some of the markets are moving too fast, not leaving investors a chance to unhurriedly close their positions (or giving a very short window). There is a chance for the thesis to play out similarly, so let’s take a note here*.

A-B-C here is pure art, so hardcore that there are no green candles (on 1M chart). It is difficult to imagine how fun it was to be a bear throughout this correction. As a result of such an intensive move, it is difficult to identify and separate the waves here, but not impossible. Analysing A-B-C: A💛38.2 again, whereas B is almost nonexistent, which probably should also be attributed to the volatility. C, in its turn, is a masterpiece of a bear creation: it pierces 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% and the 150 MA altogether (*the latter two again act as a sweet spot for the bears to touch down throughout the whole correction phase*) with a sequence of three lethal red candles. Brutal.

*Yet again, 78.6% Fibo and 150 MA save the bulls’ asses and reverse the bearish trend. And how about this observation: if A💛38.2, then it is fair to say C💙61.8%/78.6%💜150 MA - again, check the other charts for that assertion.*

&#x200B;

5. **HANG SENG 2003-2009**

https://preview.redd.it/jpnskc4k0ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16732da18c67e65b3ddf59048c95a188a231561d

Hang Seng, Konnichi wa! Interesting chart of another volatile market, with several major similarities to the previous example: powerful 3 and 5, microscopic distribution phase, A wave piercing 38.2%, C behaving almost identically as WTI C in relation to 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% and the 150 MA.

Additionally: 1💙78.6%; B🧡23.6% - never forget!

*Also, what I noticed to be a common characteristic for the majority of examples here: the tougher 3 and 5 are, the more severe correction follows. Check this point out on the other charts!*

&#x200B;

6. And finally, the thesis's grandfather **S&P 500 1995-2003**

https://preview.redd.it/jidh8gfq4ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=201f78a3a268c62c8bd52d758dd569d58b2c257b

This is the last one before SPY thesis explanation, I promise! Also, this historical example has the biggest weight among all of the discussed here, because this is the direct predecessor of the current cycle.

To begin with, 1💙78.6%. You may find it funny, or mocky that I refer to that often, but this one is a crucial point to help with the Fibo application for the thesis later. Next, 1-2-3-4-5 checklist ✅ (refer to DJI for that matter). Solid wave 3 and wave 5, which also tend to correlate with the severity of the bear phase - and again the correlation is confirmed in this cycle.

The distribution phase lasts for about 7 months, allowing plenty of time for investors to fix their profits, before the powerful A-B-C correction starts (looks a bit like DAX dagger). You may notice that A💛38.2%, and B🧡23.6% again, and these prevailing patterns will also be among the cornerstones for building the thesis. C wave, in its turn, while breaking through 61.8% Fibo retracement, gently touches 150 MA to complete the mark-down phase. 150 MA subsequently acts as a sound support for the next accumulation phase, after which the market reverts back to the bullish consensus. 

The price action elaborated in the second part of the previous paragraph yet again serves as a strong support for the proposition that *a) during a bear market 150 MA coupled with 61.8% or 78.6% plays as a reference point for the bears to aim to; and b) 150 MA + 61.8%/78.6% never (at least in the examples provided) let the bulls down in the long term*.

&#x200B;

# IV. Dr. Bearlove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bear Market

&#x200B;

Hooray! If you've read the whole thing and came this far, you are an exceptional WSB citizen of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will. If you just jumped here for the most juicy part, I should strongly encourage you to at least check several examples from III, as these are helpful in understanding what tf is going on here (I hope so).

Diving deeper now, I decided to separate the thesis into four parts: applying the core analysis and the data accumulated to 1-2-3-4-5, as the first (1) step; (2) explaining the A-B-C wave parameters of the thesis based on the historical data accumulated; and then (3) providing additional context to back up and explain the starting point of the mark-up phase (the orange triangle's nose, on the chart below) - please take it take for granted for now; while the last piece of puzzle incorporates the elaboration of the distribution's and A-B-C's duration (4).  


[The Thesis Restated](https://preview.redd.it/3zyw4s3tsju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58a0b02a76265ae06da11d0225cfe16e19bbcd40)

1. **Fucking Finally**

Remember 1💙78.6% (and DAX wave 1 explanation)? This is what originally gave me a hint of where to start looking for the proper 1-2-3-4-5 application. Before identifying this structure, I attempted to apply waves and Fibo to Mar 2009, or Oct 2011 as to the starting points, and these just didn't fit. Several mindfucks later I noticed that June 2013 \[elaborated upon later in ⬇️(3) in a very great detail, I promise!\] is the actual 1-2-3-4-5 initiation point, and it all started rollin'...

Fibonacci retracement coupled with the Elliot wave theory, when applied properly, may well be used as a beacon shining the light on the timeliness and the necessity of a correction. In my opinion, the thesis illustrates that metaphor incredibly well, just by showing how precisely the technical framework fucking fits this SPY lab 🐁. Take a look how adherent the price action is in its interaction with the Fibo levels (e.g. the lengthy consolidations below 78.6% and in between 50% and 61.8%, or 23.6% clearly acting as a resistance during 4). But most importantly, check out this gorgeous Elliot waves 1-2-3-4-5 pattern, which is either completed already (my bet), or will be done in the not so distant future. Let me elaborate on all of that.

Staring from Fibo and wave one, this time the price action surrounding apex of wave 1, wave 2 and the beginning of 3 💙78.6% for about 2 years! If this is not a true love, then I don’t know what is. Wave 1, in this case, is a very solid incarnation of the traditional 1 structure: soft, relaxed and unhurried. Additionally to that, 1 looks similar to four other examples in III, particularly DAX, Gold, WTI and Hang Seng.

Next, let’s recall an important principle regarding 1-2-3-4-5, discussed in III:3 (Gold), namely: the structures for the second and the fourth wave usually alternate in the following interdependence - if the second wave is a flat correction, wave four tends to have a sharper structure and vice versa. Take a look at the thesis chart again: like in a fucking Raffaello slogan - more than a thousand words.

The final step to do is to go through the 1-2-3-4-5 golden checklist, introduced in III:1 (DJI):  


* Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1 (just ✅)
* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5 (✅)
* Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1 (✅, however, with a minor remark: vertical 4 was really close to breaking the rule in this case, but... Elliot \[or JPOW, if you are a fundamentals guy\] intervened just in time for the bulls)

Is it fair to say that the confirmations provided above ere enough to support the thesis in relation to 1-2-3-4-5 and Fibo? I would say yes, but what do I know? What is your opinion, fellow expert?

&#x200B;

2. **Stonks Only Go Up, (Except for Retracements)**

[One more time, for the sake of convenience](https://preview.redd.it/ax2isvnikru61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12e75efe538cee76f0fa852f89ff85417099cfa7)

Now, let's discuss the most ungrateful part. Ungrateful, because the chances are, well, that markets will shit on your TA and forecasts, even if a lot of effort was put into it. So what, I am not a fucking pussy to stop trying and learning.

Anyway, this is how I got the A-B-C projection parameters. Again, based purely on the historical data accumulated. First things first, A💛38.2%, and at this point it is an understatement. Please, refer to III and check the charts. Seriously, do not be lazy, it is worth it. Because you will notice that A wave gravitates to 38.2% on all of the examples analyzed, to a great extent. Especially, check the grandfather (III:6), which weights at least twice as much for the thesis, compared to others (perks of being relatives). B wave, in its turn, retraces to 23.6% or above in 4 cases out of 6: DJI, DAX, Hang Seng and the grandfather - which is sufficient to assume that B🧡23.6%, imho.

Oh yeah, wave C. It was stopped by 50% Fibo once (Gold), twice by 61.8% (grandfather and DJI) and three times by 78.6% in DAX, WTI and Hang Seng. Also, it has been evident through all of the examples, that C has a fetish for 150 MA, and it is mutual. These factors, after being summed up, weighted, and distilled - point at the zone between 61.8% and 78.6% Fibo. And guess what? The grandfather's C landed just there. Noice.

&#x200B;

3. **Fat, Ugly Cup Konsolidation**

[The chart above represents a longer term outlook on SP 500. The price level of 155 played as a holding back factor, before being broken through in the middle of 2013, which resulted in the current bull run.](https://preview.redd.it/z7lvx4trlku61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=642d73ee2883b1b1c2fbee13c493df4c171d0edb)

As it has been mentioned, it was difficult for me to identify where to start the wave count for the thesis. Before I zoomed out, and saw this ⬆️. F.U.C.K is how I named it. 

&#x200B;

4. **The Methodology behind the Mark-Down Duration Estimation, or ""Wen Bottom""**

Fuk, I just wanna go sleep, so take this short explanation. Based on the previous cycles and mark up to mark down historical proportions: 63/22≈2.86; 48/15=3.2; (3.2+2.86)/2=3.03.

1. Gold and Silver, [SLV](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/) is not recommended, physical assets is the way to go
2. [Emerging markets](https://youtu.be/RYfmRTyl56w?t=1032) (ETFs, stocks, bonds)
3. Value stocks
4. Long dated SPY puts
5. VIX
6. Some negative beta bad boys
7. Leveraged Bearish ETFs like SQQQ
8. [FDs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m862k3/4100_put_contracts_pretty_dumb_but_i_believe_i/)","['NDAQ', 'DOW', 'SPGI']"

Counter argument is the world reopening will artificially show growth but it will look like growth. Money printers will keep printing. Inflation will keep prices going up.

All this just from coming off a successful phase 3 Covid [test](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ocugen-ocgn-positive-data-covid-143702261.html), but that news came out Wednesday... hang on

Don’t we have a bunch of companies that are already supplying the world with vaccines?

6X for that? That seems kinda suspect

Lemme put my tin hat on real quick

What if... now hear me out...

What if Ocugen (which some guy somewhere said citadel just recently shorted past 100%) is actually a small money, small scale version of GME that citadel is testing to figure out what strategies would work best to make the most money when they have to cover? 

It started its steep climb around $5.50. Move the decimal over two places: $550. That’s right around where margin calls would most likely start coming in. Pretty convenient to analyzing a strategy if you just have to move the decimal. 

Plus, Level 2  shows all of the sell orders are stacked in a at a constant climb, which could simulate a constant rise in price. And there’s major sell offs at mental breaking points on the dollars and on the $.5s, to simulate well, major sell offs. 

It just looks like a field test to me, and it really could be. Just sayin",

mx0586,gvl8jka,wallstreetbets,comment,1619199227,"Ocugen is mooning because the CEO posted on LinkedIn last night that they're filing for EUA. 

Do some research. Covaxin performs the best against the variants, has had 100% efficacy against severe covid (and even hospitalization), and can be used as a booster for the other vaccines being used in the US. It will also be the cheapest available to us, and can be stored in a normal freezer.

People act like there aren't 50 different flu vaccines. And people act like we all get two shots and then we're done. Covid isn't going away. Vaccines aren't* going away. More will enter the market. Make money on it while you can.

mwt602,,wallstreetbets,post,1619177411,"$SKLZ on April 23rd$SKLZ stock hit a high of $46.30 and currently sits in the $16’s. In the last two days, Cathie Wood added over 6 million shares across ARKK and ARKW, her biggest purchase by far. Technically speaking, SKLZ looks to be in a reversal path and the risk reward scenario is highly favorable. This company can honestly grow in huge multiples in the next 5 years and beyond. I see the price here being over $200 by end of 2023. 

DD:

1. SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth), when they do become profitable, expected in 2022, the profits will grow wildly. They are debt free and have 600 million on their balance sheet however. 

2. SKLZ is a platform provider for betting between users who play Mobile games, the fastest growing gaming market. Think of SKLZ as the Shopify of gaming. $SHOP provides a platform to small e-commerce outfits whereas SKLZ provides a platform to the small game developers. SHOP was $10/share just 5 years ago. The mobile market is expected to double in the next 4 years. 

3. The US is only 10% of the worlds mobile gaming market, and SKLZ is in process of expanding to India this year. They have included the costs of India expansion into projections, but none of the projected revenues. India is a larger market and growing at a much faster rate. This could literally double revenues by next year. 

4. The CEO (Andrew Paradise) has stated as recently as yesterday that his company aims to “gamify” exercise, education, etc. He brought up what a Peloton partnership would look like in a Fool interview yesterday. Essentially, people would verse each other on their bikes. This would make it more fun and add a betting element. This partnership would be HUGE. 

5. SKLZ already has a partnership with the NFL for a developer to make a football-themed SKLZ app this year. They can easily make partnerships with the remaining sports organizations. SKLZ also intends to expand into first person shooters and racing games this year. 

Apes, this is a play that has been HIGHLY shorted (28% currently) from its top, and has the actual thematic story, fundamentals, and price targets to support a huge short term run, and long term growth.",['ARKK']
