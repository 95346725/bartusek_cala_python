mk9aak,,stocks,post,1617584936,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 yearsThe U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

mki9or,,stocks,post,1617621456,"Janet Yellen to call for global minimum tax rateJanet Yellen will use her first major address as Treasury secretary to argue for a global minimum corporate tax rate, Axios has learned, as she makes the case for President Biden’s plan to raise U.S. corporate taxes to fund his $2 trillion+ infrastructure plan.

Why it matters: Convincing other countries to impose a global minimum tax would reduce the likelihood of companies relocating offshore, as Biden seeks to increase the corporate rate from 21% to 28%.

“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” Yellen will say today in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to an excerpt of her prepared remarks obtained by Axios.
""It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.""
""We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom.""
The big picture: President Trump lowered the U.S. rate from 35% to 21%, arguing that U.S. companies were at a global disadvantage and were being incentivized to relocate offshore.

The average corporate rate in the G7 is 24%, with some nine countries recently lowering their corporate rate, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative tax group.
Biden’s plan would also raise the international minimum rate for foreign profits from U.S. companies from 10.5% to 21%, which would still be lower than the 28% domestic corporate rate.
Driving the news: Biden has tapped five Cabinet secretaries to explain — and sell — his plan to the American public, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

Yellen’s task is to make the international case. Her speech also is designed to set the tone for the annual spring International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, which will begin virtually this week.
Between the lines: Biden has been relying on Yellen to convince the business community and reassure Wall Street that his $2 trillion+ infrastructure proposal, on top of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package, won’t lead to inflation.

Now he’s deploying her to convince international finance ministers and central bankers that the world’s biggest economies need to act in concert on corporate rates to avoid a race to the bottom.
Go deeper: Yellen will also challenge the world’s economic powers to focus on climate change and on ways to improve vaccine access for the world’s poorest countries.

She will call for $650 billion in new “Special Drawing Rights” — essentially lines of credit at the IMF that can help developing countries access more U.S. dollars.
The Trump administration was skeptical of new SDR allocations and many congressional Republicans are still opposed.
The bottom line: By trying to convince other countries to impose a global minimum tax, Yellen is acknowledging the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.

“Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,” she will say.

About $GLSI

&#x200B;

Greenwich LifeSciences (Nasdaq: GLSI) is a public clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of an immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences in patients who have previously undergone surgery, that is developing GP2, a novel peptide immunotherapy, and is planning to commence a Phase III clinical trial ([https://greenwichlifesciences.com](https://greenwichlifesciences.com)).

GP2 is derived from the HER2/neu protein, which is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including breast cancer.  Tumors with elevated expression of HER2/neu protein are highly aggressive, resulting in an increased disease recurrence and a worse prognosis.  In a Phase IIb clinical trial in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting, no breast cancer recurrences were observed after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized.  In addition, GP2 treatment is well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to GP2 immunotherapy were reported.

&#x200B;

Upcoming Potential Catalysts for 2021

April 9-10- Greenwich is to announces more GP2 data on at the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) annual meeting, where the company will release the final 5-year immune response results from its Phase IIb trial ([https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual)).

The AACR plans to publish two Greenwich LifeSciences abstracts on April 9, 2021 at 12:01 am EST and posters on April 10, 2021 on its Phase IIb clinical trial's final five year immune response data and its planned Phase III clinical trial updated design.

Obviously I can’t predict the future, but  I hypothesize- determinate on the outcome of the results- that price action will be fire in the premarket and could start as early as 04:00:01 est. For that reason I am planning to set a GTC, extended hours, limit order the night before (04/08) with a lofty price target as things can get crazy in the premarket with low volume and high volatility. 

Planned Phase III Trial: 9 amino acid HER2/neu peptide + GM-CSF immunotherapy for breast cancer in adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting (postsurgery) in HER2/neu 3+, HLA-A2 patients in Y2 following Herceptin or Kadcyla. 

You can see the clinical trial design here: [https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf](https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf)

Breast Cancer

I’m not going to go into an overview of what breast cancer is, if you want to know more->[https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F). But here are some easily digestible facts to illustrate it’s likelihood, frequency, and most importantly the unmet need for improved treatment

One in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, with approximately 266,000 new breast cancer patients and 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in 2018, all of whom have the potential to experience breast cancer recurrences (Source: American Cancer Society).

HER2/neu 3+ (“HER2-positive”) breast cancer patients comprise approximately 25% of all breast cancer patients (Source: American Society of Clinical Oncology).

For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. In 2021, it's estimated that about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancers.

Breast cancer became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

About 85% of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. These occur due to genetic mutations that happen as a result of the aging process and life in general, rather than inherited mutations.

The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are sex (being a woman) and age (growing older).

This is significant because these are not factors one can necessarily change, as opposed to being able to reduce your risk for lung cancer by not smoking, avoiding radiation, and radon, etc.

Unmet Need

[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_4f618b556249e3eca7fb25614da846e5/greenwichlifesciences/db/857/7460/pdf/Corporate+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4f618b556249e3eca7fb25614da846e5/greenwichlifesciences/db/857/7460/pdf/Corporate+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf)

&#x200B;

So what does that mean?

$GLSI isn’t trying to replace current therapies, but work in tangent with them and is designed to be compatible with future derivatives:

		“GP2 can be the treatment that will naturally overlap with or follow Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu or any of the other Herceptin derivatives being developed” (pg. 6)

&#x200B;

So the way I see this, GLSI isn’t trying to come into the marketplace as a competitor to the current treatment options available (which would be a much harder pitch to doctors who are currently using Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu) but as a supplementary treatment. 

&#x200B;

“GP2 & GM-CSF starting in Year 2 act synergistically with Herceptin to prevent cancer recurrences, if fully immunized, reducing recurrence rates from 11% to 0% at median 5 years follow-up (p = 0.0338), with minimal to no side effects & no SAEs.”

“In the initial GP2 indication, approximately 17,000 new patients could be treated per year, saving up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year.” (pg4)

Side note: notice that the quote above didn’t really need to be said; and definitely not included in a presentation of clinical data (presumably every doctor scrutinizing the results can do simple math). As an investor, this is one of the many things that make me very bullish about GLSI. A company could get fantastic clinical results but as the average investor doesn’t know how to interpret the results, if the company doesn’t present them in an easily digestible form, many investors will (rightfully so) pass on trading that position.  And GLSI does that. You don’t even need a GED to open their PR, see “0% recurrence of breast cancer in 96 patients over 5 years” and “results indicate  GP2 could save up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year” to know that is great news and hop in a position trading on that news. More people trading => more volume, and on a low float stock like GLSI (2.69M shares according to yahfin) it will not take much to get the share price moving. If GLSI comes out and shows that the rest of their data is as good as their top-line, it will be a very profitable day for trading. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead of cancer, imagine GLSI was focusing on migraines and their medicine gets FDA approved. Now why would the doctor prescribe GLSI over some other company that he has been prescribing for years and years he knows works fairly well (so harder to get into the marketplace = less sales = less revenue)? Not to mention the doctor’s probably got connections and fiscal incentives already connected to the current treatment options, so again there would be less incentive to prescribe GLSI. 

But what if you went to the doctor’s with a migraine, got treated for your migraine using your doctor’s preferred treatment options (so he’s still happy) and then as a patient was provided with an option to take a booster pill. The doctor tells you, so far about 100 people have taken the booster pill and NONE of them have had ANY migraines in the 5 years since taking it. On top of that, there have been little to NO side effects after taking the booster pill.  So would you take the booster pill to safely and effectively eliminate the possibilities of a migraine every coming back (or at least, for the next 5+ years)?

Now replace migraine with breast cancer, and that booster pill is $GLSI 

&#x200B;

Breast cancer (ALL cancer) is extremely scary, I don’t even pretend to know what kind of impact that diagnosis  can have on one’s life. I am apart of a family who has been horribly affected by cancer and I know we would do anything to prevent having to relive that experience nightmare. And as breast cancer is the number 1 common cancer globally, I know my family is not alone in this feeling of desperation.

Additional Details

4 clinical trials. 138 treated breast cancer patients. ​

No cancer recurrences if fully immunized.  No reported serious adverse events.  Well tolerated safety profile.

Thus far, the safety and efficacy of the GP2 immunotherapy have been tested in four clinical trials, where 138 patients have received treatment to date. The past trials consist of three Phase I clinical trials and one Phase IIb clinical trial. 

In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center (16 sites) Phase IIb clinical trial led by MD Anderson and completed in 2018, no recurrences were observed in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized with GP2 (p = 0.0338). 

Full immunization was received in the Primary Immunization Series (PIS), which included the first 6 GP2 + GM-CSF intradermal injections over the first 6 months.  The PIS elicited a potent immune response as measured by local skin tests and immunological assays.  Further, booster injections given every 6 months prolonged the immune response, thereby providing longer term protection.  In the Phase IIb and three Phase I clinical trials, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the GP2 immunotherapy. 

89 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF, 91 placebo patients treated with GM-CSF

17 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF + trastuzumab

14 patients treated with GP2 + AE37 + GM-CSF

18 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF

Top performing IPO in 2020 ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28)).

On December 8, 2020, GLSI share price closed at $5.20 per share. Then GLSI published its 5-year breast cancer data from a Phase IIb trial on December 9, which showed 0% breast cancer recurrences over 5 years of follow-up. On that day, the company's stock spiked to $158 per share and closed at $57 per share, surging the next day to $128 per share and closing at $72 per share. 

This shows huge (positive) market sentiment towards the data and it is reasonable to assume the market will react similarly on similar news. Perhaps even stronger since this data set will be the complete results. 

The company experienced another spike in share price on March 8, 2021, opening at $23 per share, spiking at $53 per share, before finally closing at $37 per share when it was announced that Dr. Jaye Thompson would be brought on full time to lead the GP2 Phase III trial in the fight against breast cancer. 

A 130% increase in share price just on the news of HIRING someone for phase III shows the market is still very much interested in Greenwich’s GP2 trial.

Greenwich LifeSciences Announces Option Agreement for Pre-clinical Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates

“Snehal Patel, CEO of Greenwich LifeSciences, commented, “While we are focused on the upcoming GP2 Phase III breast cancer clinical trial, and are also exploring how to expand the use of GP2 in additional indications through supplemental clinical trials, we have decided to explore the addition of new immunotherapy product candidates to our pipeline at both the pre-clinical and clinical stages of development. The objective of the coronavirus vaccine program is to leverage the development team’s experience in achieving 100% protection against lethal levels of pneumonic plague infection to increase the percent protection and duration of protection of coronavirus vaccines under development. It is not clear how long one will be protected by the current Covid-19 vaccines and none that have been developed to date offer 100% protection. We are hopeful that our approach, which showed 100% protection against pneumonic plague, may lead to greater and longer lasting protection compared to existing Covid-19 vaccines under development.”” [https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates)

Personally- is this a reason to buy GLSI? No. Is this a reason to hold GLSI? No. Is this bad news for GLSI? Absolutely not. This holds no impact in my position of GLSI. It is definitely bullish news.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In September 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering and raised $7,250,002 in gross proceeds and $6,207,502 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In December 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering and raised $26,400,000 in gross proceeds and $23,959,000 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Company met and exceeded those predictions thus mitigating any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05 and its ability to satisfy the estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There’s never anything wrong with securing profits. A low risk strategy would be to secure profits on the run up by selling before the catalyst drops. 

One optimal approach is sell enough shares to cover your cost basis and let your remaining shares ride into the catalyst. 

Curiously, GLSI has waited until circa 1:20 pm est to run on multiple occasions- I can’t even begin to speculate why but unless GLSI hits over $150 in the morning I will most likely be hanging out in the position until at least 2pm est. 

Obviously, I’ll use TA to monitor the situation and will adjust my current strategy depending on new data. 

With such a low float, low volume stock, poised to release such great news, it makes a realistic price target very hard to chart out or even predict with any confidence. If $GLSI can break past resistance in the low 50s, it could easily gap back up over 100 with enough volume. The possibility is there, the likelihood is unknown. 

I will be watching GLSI closely on 04/09, and will use indicators to help navigate the best exit price. Note, on their topline data, RSI went well past 95, so if one sold at 70 there would have been a lot of money left on the table.

Couple final tips to help you determine when to sell:

Don’t be greedy.

No one ever went broke taking profits.

If it’s worth screenshotting, it’s worth selling. 

&#x200B;

Insider Trading

From [https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi](https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi) we can see there were several insider purchases of the stock before the initial topline data was announced and have not see any selling of the stock, even during it’s 3000% run. This makes me very bullish.

##**Engineering & Construction.** 
Analyst Sean Eastman says ""the reinforced focus on infrastructure stimulus and on climate resilience will be powerful multiyear themes.""

1. **AECOM** (NYSE:ACM) can expect a tailwind to its all-organic-growth strategy and ""transportation, environment, and water design/engineering"" represents 65% of revenue.
2. **Quanta Services** (NYSE:PWR) is ""a major enabler of the electrification of the economy, the interconnection of renewable power generation, and the modernization of the electric grid.""
3. **Dycom Industries** (NYSE:DY) is essentially a pureplay on telecom infrastructure specialty contracting and ""should be a beneficiary of rural broadband build-outs.""

##**Machinery & Equipment Rental.** 
Analysts Steve Barger and Ken Newman see ""particular upside potential for our construction machinery OEMs, equipment rental companies, and rail transportation manufacturers.""

1. **Oshkosh** (NYSE:OSK) and **Terex** (NYSE:TEX) are picks with a view that ""new and/or replacement buildings and infrastructure would drive increased utilization for AWPs, telehandlers and scissor lifts, cement mixers, crushing and screening equipment, and potentially fire and emergency trucks.""
2. **Federal Signal** (NYSE:FSS) will benefit from spending on replacement lead pipes and building affordable housing.
3. **Wabtec** (NYSE:WAB) should see business from modernizing public transit and investment in passenger and freight rail.
4. **United Rentals** (NYSE:URI) will get a broad boost from infrastructure spending because of the ""fungibility"" of its fleet.

##**Metals.** 
Analyst Phil Gibbs says the spending program will offer a demand catalyst in the ""intermediate term,"" but the size of the package will likely be closer to $500B to $1T.

1. Along with the broader group, direct beneficiaries with ties the infrastructure or earth-moving equipment will be, in order: **Commercial Metals** (NYSE:CMC), **Nucor** (NYSE:NUE), **Reliance Steel and Aluminum** (NYSE:RS), **Steel Dynamics** (NASDAQ:STLD), **Olympic Steel** (NASDAQ:ZEUS) and **Schnitzer Steel** (NASDAQ:SCHN).

##**Diversified Industrial.** 
Analyst Jeff Hammond thinks the entire group would benefit for fundamental and sentiment reasons.

1. **Colfax** (NYSE:CFX), from welding, **Harsco** (NYSE:HSC), **Eaton** (NYSE:ETN) and **nVent Electric** (NYSE:NVT), both for EV chargers, **Helios Tech** (NASDAQ:HLIO), **Gates Industrial** (NYSE:GTES) should benefit in transportation.
2. **Parker-Hannifin** (NYSE:PH), **ETN**, **NVT**, **Nordson** (NASDAQ:NDSN), **Altra Industrial Motion** (NASDAQ:AIMC), **Rexnord** (NYSE:RXN), **Regal Beloit** (NYSE:RBC), **CFX**, **Enerpac Tool Group** (NYSE:EPAC) will benefit in manufacturing.
3. **Carrier Global** (NYSE:CARR), **Lennox International** (NYSE:LII), **Trane Technologies** (NYSE:TT), **Watsco** (NYSE:WSO), for HVAC, should benefit in housing.
4. **CARR, LII, TT, WSO,** for ventilation upgrades, will benefit in schools spending.
5. **CARR, LII, TT** should benefit from federal building upgrades.
6. **ETN, Generac Holdings** (NYSE:GNRC) should benefit from alternative energy.

##**Auto Suppliers.** 
Analyst James Picariello says the plan is well targeted for the blueprints for mass EV adoption, which are ""strict and consistent emissions regulations, generous consumer tax incentives, and a determinable charging infrastructure buildout.""

1. **Aptiv** (NYSE:APTV) and **BorgWarner** (NYSE:BWA) lead EV supplier opportunities, followed by **Dana** (NYSE:DAN), **Meritor** (NYSE:MTOR), **Magna International** (NYSE:MGA) and **Lear** (NYSE:LEA), but the latter two would be disproportionately hit by higher corporate tax rates.
2. **MTOR** and **DAN** will also benefit from the impact on truck and off-highway markets.

##**Vertical Software.** 
Analyst Jason Celino thinks the plan would ""accelerate digitization opportunities across the architecture and construction industry.""

1. **Bentley Systems** (NASDAQ:BSY) gets 60% of total revenue from infrastructure, so the plan could lead to ""meaningful multiyear tailwinds.""
2. **Autodesk** (NASDAQ:ADSK) exposure to infrastructure of 15-20% of revenue and the ""completion of its Innoyze acquisition, providing solutions for water infrastructure assets, gives us incremental confidence.""
3. **Trimble** (NASDAQ:TRMB) has 25-30% of revenue from infrastructure ""geospatial, construction, and civil engineering offerings are well positioned.""

##**Chemicals.** 
Analyst Aleksey Yefremov highlights benefits for ""industrial coatings, polyurethanes, epoxy, PVC, and chlor-alkali.""

1. **Huntsman** (NYSE:HUN) will see higher end-market demand, with the most upside in polyurethanes.
2. **Olin** (NYSE:OLN) is a pick as the ""proposed spending package laid out plans for manufacturing spend, a key end market for caustic soda. Industrial coatings and adhesives is also a major end market for the Epoxy segment.""
3. **Westlake Chemical** (NYSE:WLK) is ""a beneficiary of strong PVC, building products (mostly pipe), and chlor-alkali markets.""
4. **DuPont** (NYSE:DD) has the most compatible portfolio for the spending bill.
5. **Albemarle** (NYSE:ALB), **Livent** (NYSE:LTHM) should benefit from a pickup in EV support.

##**Communication Services.** 
Analyst Brandon Nispel says the bill ""is positive for infrastructure providers (tower operators) and neutral to negative for network providers (wireless carriers and cable operators).""

1. **American Tower** (NYSE:AMT), **Crown Castle** (NYSE:CCI), **SBA Communications** (NASDAQ:SBAC) are picks in towers, which will be helped by improving investment in wireless networks.
2. **Altice USA** (NYSE:ATUS), **Cable One** (NYSE:CABO), **Charter Communications** (NASDAQ:CHTR), **Comcast** (NASDAQ:CMCSA), **WildOpenWest** (NYSE:WOW) may see a hit to discretionary cash flow due to a higher corporate tax rate.
3. **AT&T** (NYSE:T), **T-Mobile U.S.** (NASDAQ:TMUS) and **Verizon** (NYSE:VZ) are the most at risk of a corporate tax rate hike, with T and VZ seeing incremental taxes of $1.5B to $2B.

##**Entertainment and Video Games.** 
Analyst Tyler Parker says the plan for bringing high-speed broadband to every American will help domestic online vide games

1. **Activision** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts** (NASDAQ:EA), **Take-Two Interactive** (NASDAQ:TTWO) and **Ubisoft** (UBISFY) could see tailwinds.

##**Semiconductors.** 
Analysts John Vinh and Wes Twigg say ""expansion incentives would likely be a tailwind for semiconductor equipment demand while easing the capex burden on manufacturers.""

1. **Applied Materials** (NASDAQ:AMAT), **ASML** (NASDAQ:ASML), **Advanced Energy Industries** (NASDAQ:AEIS), KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), **Lam Research** (NASDAQ:LRCX) and **Teradyne** (NASDAQ:TER) would benefit in equipment names.
2. **Analog Devices** (NASDAQ:ADI), **Intel** (NASDAQ:INTC), **Micron** (NASDAQ:MU), **ON Semiconductor** (NASDAQ:ON) and **Texas Instruments** (NASDAQ:TXN) are picks among those with domestic manufacturing footprints.

1. **American Electric Power** (NASDAQ:AEP), **Southern** (NYSE:SO), **Duke Energy** (NYSE:DUK), **Dominion Energy** (NYSE:D), **Entergy** (NYSE:ETR) and **Edison International** (NYSE:EIX) can benefit from incremental grid investment initiatives and electrifications trends from an EV tide that will ""lift all boats.""

3. **Public Service Enterprise Group** (PEG), **Excelon** (NASDAQ:EXC) and **Energy Harbor** (OTCPK:ENGH) would benefit from any concrete federal program to support nuclear energy.
4. **First Solar** (NASDAQ:FSLR) may get a boost if solar installers can bypass Chinese tariffs.

##**Oil and Gas Exploration and Production.**

NEW YORK  (Reuters) -     U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, as a round of strong  economic data on the labor market and services sector buoyed investor  optimism for the economic reopening and a muted climb in the 10-year  U.S. Treasury yield kept inflation worries at bay.

An ISM survey for March showed a measure of U.S. services industry  activity jumped to a record high. The data followed Friday's report  showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs in March, trouncing  forecasts.  

Investors have bet on sectors poised to lead an economic reopening,  such as energy, financials and materials. A climbing yield on the  10-year U.S. Treasury note has dented appetite for technology stocks. 

Despite strong economic data, gains were led by sectors that have  underperformed recently, including communication services, consumer  discretionary and tech, as the 10-year yield remained below a 14-month  high hit last week.  

""One of the fears in March was that the rise in rates meant you need to take multiples down,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 

""It's not the reopening trade at this point, it is higher interest  rates are here but not accelerating so the whole economy is being  lifted."" 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 385.96 points, or 1.16%, to  33,539.17, the S&P 500 gained 59.11 points, or 1.47%, to 4,078.98  and the Nasdaq Composite added 234.78 points, or 1.74%, to 13,714.89.

With speedy vaccinations and additional government stimulus helping  the S&P 500 and the Dow clinch all-time highs, focus now turns to  progress on a massive infrastructure plan and the upcoming corporate  earnings season.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still about 4% below its February high as  the recent spike in bond yields spurred inflation concerns and made  growth stocks less attractive.

Energy shares were the worst performing sector, following a sharp  drop in oil prices. Reopening plays gained, as the S&P 1500 airlines  index jumped 3.43% after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk.""

By Tsvetana Paraskova - Apr 05, 2021, 12:00 PM CDT

The United States has made the first step toward harnessing the potential of wave energy, a powerful source of renewable energy which researchers have been studying for decades.   
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued last month a license for what would be the first commercial-scale, utility grid-connected wave energy test site in the United States.
Oregon State University received that license to build and operate the PacWave South testing facility as the industry is developing technology and devices potentially capable of harnessing the power of ocean waves.
Despite decades of studies, wave energy is still little developed—both in the U.S. and elsewhere—because researchers are still looking at ways to reconcile feasibility and costs in a complex marine environment.
In theory, the potential is enormous. In practice, wave energy will need a lot more testing and technology development if it hopes to become a viable renewable energy source.
Nevertheless, a testing facility operational by the middle of this decade could give the impetus the U.S. industry needs to test various technologies for generating electricity from waves and attract investors in the most promising technology. The Biden Administration’s support of renewable energy could also help with industry innovation.
The U.S. is one of the best places in the world for ocean wave energy generation, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ocean waves have tremendous energy, and the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh). This equals around 64 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, the EIA says.Related: U.S. Oil Production Is About To Climb
The potential is there, and it is tremendous. Still, the industry now needs to test and possibly show that wave energy can make a difference with viable solutions in the drive for boosting renewable energy generation.
Oregon State University’s project leaders hope to obtain from FERC construction authorization for the PacWave South testing facility later this spring. Current timelines suggest that construction could begin this summer, and the facility could be operational by 2023, OSU says.
“We know there is still work to do to make this project a reality, but this is a huge moment for this project and for the industry as a whole,” Burke Hales, chief scientist for PacWave, said in a statement.
The World Energy Council estimates that 10 percent of the worldwide electricity demand could be met by harvesting ocean energy, OSU said.
The PacWave test facility could be the companies’ place to showcase technology in order to attract investors in their proposed developments, according to Hales.
“Even somebody like Bill Gates isn’t going to pay somebody millions of dollars to do tests that they think will fail,” Hales told Grist’s Ysabelle Kempe.
Innovation and testing of devices could unlock the tremendous energy potential of ocean waves, which is highest along the Pacific shorelines: California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, according to a recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory funded by the Department of Energy. The study focuses on the technical resource—the proportion of the theoretical resource that can be captured using existing technology options.
The study found that utilizing just one-tenth of the technically available marine energy resources in the 50 states would equate to 5.7 percent of the current U.S. electricity generation, or enough energy to power 22 million homes. 
DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has identified “energy hotspots” of wave power along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts.
“Wave power is a significant, sizeable resource,” marine coastal science advisor Simon Geerlofs says. Yet, he noted that wave energy still has challenges to overcome, including big hurdles like ensuring durability and efficiency of wave energy converters and cost-competitiveness with other energy resources. ",['PM']

In super-simplified terms, Xray machines have two key parts: an emitter (which I'll call a light bulb or light tube) and a receiver/detector.

NNOX has apparently only invented a cheaper lightbulb (emitter), not a new detector.  Sounds great, right?  But in reality, the ""light bulb"" component of legacy X Ray machines virtually never fails, and if it does, it's always covered by the seller/leaseholder of the machine for free.  So they're effectively replacing something that nobody who thinks it through will care about.

And supposedly their light bulb is very limited in what parameters it operates, whereas the legacy light bulb sources can be dialled in for all kinds of uses.

If NNOX had invented BOTH a cheaper light tube AND a cheaper detector, then that would be compelling.  But apparently they haven't.

Maybe that take is wrong, and maybe there's some opportunity for slightly lowering the capital cost and the necessary building wiring for a new clinic install.  But it's apparently not as revolutionary as the company promoters make it sound.",['XRAY']

**Novavax's vaccine is crazy effective, cheap to make, and easy to transport.**

""The way Novavax’ vaccine works is different even from the ones previously mentioned and approved for use in the United States. NVX-CoV2373 (the formal name for their vaccine) is a protein-based subunit vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. It is adjuvanted 4 with Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-MTM which enhances the immune response and stimulates high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This vaccine candidate does require two doses, spaced three weeks apart. ""

"" Second-generation vaccines, of which Novavax is one, are identified based on their potential to provide protection with a single dose, exhibit stability in greater temperature ranges, remain stable throughout the manufacturing process, yield an improved or differentiated immune response, and use a diverse range of antigens. They are historically cheaper and have had higher levels of efficacy and safety. ""

**They already have over a 200 million orders and they have a worldwide supply chain and distribution already set up.**

""To date, Novavax has increased its projected global manufacturing production rate of NVX-CoV2373 to be over two billion annualized doses when they’re at full capacity, which is expected to occur in mid-2021. Of this anticipated capacity, approximately one billion doses will be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL). Novavax has developed partnerships with entities across the globe to increase its manufacturing capacity and vaccine supplies ""

""Novavax has entered into advanced purchase agreements with various countries globally that, if the vaccine is approved, are expected to result in the delivery of approximately 200 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 throughout 2021 and into the first half of 2022 ""

**It looks like coronavirus is not going away, so people will continue to need boosters and shots to take care of the variant strains.**

""From what I’ve learned about Novavax, they seem to be well-positioned to give COVID-19 the knockout punch. Their underlying recombinant nanoparticle technology has the ability to accurately target viral pathogens and create protein antigens organized around a polysorbate-based nanoparticle core, the assembly of which resembles the native presentation of the pathogen being targeted. This process creates highly-immunogenic, long-lasting, yet safe, vaccines that can tackle not only COVID-19 and its variant strains, but also a wide variety of other disease organisms. One of Novavax’ near-term clinical development work is evaluating the viability of certain combination vaccines, which, if successful, could potentially lead to a seasonal 3-in-1 or 2-in-1 vaccine shot that would take care of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV ""

TLDR: Honestly, no company has the combination of (1) 90%+ efficacy, (2) easy transport and storage, and (3) easy modification like Novavax does. I think this vaccine, along with Pfizer/BioNTech (which I owned last year) will end up the big winner from all this. Moderna is behind Pfizer, AstraZeneca is an absolute mess (the clots appear to be real), and Johnson & Johnson is simply not all that effective.

Price targets on eTrade on average are $323, that's 74% upside. Catalysts coming in April (UK) and May (US). Obviously, all vaccine plays carry risk, but there's no logical reason for the recent downward pressure on NVAX's price. It's part of my well-diversified portfolio.

Having said that, I'm thinking about finally creating my own portfolio. I've never done this, despite having a finance background.

My goals are quite simple: 1) Set a sector weight cap limit for each sector, so that if there's a breach, I sell some stock and bring it down. Also setting a ""stock"" weight limit, etc. So I'll be watching those carefully and then I'll know when to take profits or rebalance my positions.

If you look at the 1Y chart on Viacom you can see it made an outrageous run.

Most importantly, if you sell any stock at a loss, you can't repurchase it until the 31st day after the sale or else it's considered a wash sale, and the capital loss is disallowed. Selling at a gain and repurchasing immediately isn't a problem.

There's no need to sell everything at once. You could gradually sell positions in RH, wait for the trades to clear, then transfer the cash out and into your new Fidelity account.

mkidra,,stocks,post,1617621851,"CVM (CEL-SCI). Pharma Play for April.**Who:** 

CVM (CEL-SCI)

&nbsp;

**What:**

 CEL-SCI is a biotech company running a Phase III clinical trial with its flagship compound, Multikine.  Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) is an investigational immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a potential treatment for head and neck cancer, and cervical dysplasia or perianal warts in HIV / HPV co-infected patients. If it were to be approved for use following completion of our clinical development program, Multikine could be part of the next generation of cancer immunotherapy because:
•	It is being developed as an off-the-shelf investigational therapy making large scale manufacturing at a reasonable cost possible.
•	It is being developed with both active and passive immunity, which means that no external antigens are needed; and
•	 It is being studied for administration prior to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, when the immune system may be more intact and thus with greater potential to be activated.

&nbsp;

**Why Now:**

In April 2020, CEL-SCI announced that the last event required to complete the trial had happened. The data lock phase has taken longer than expected due to COVID constraints and for the length of the process required to gather the data of this 10 years lasting multi-center and multi-country trial. CEL-SCI management has stated the 298th event has not occurred which hints that Multikine is effective. Survival of cancer patients going through S-RT or S-CRT is 57.4% at year 3, and 48.2% at year 5 in America. Based on current information we can safely conclude that patients are living much longer than they should already. There is speculation that the expected survival rate could be increased to 74.4%!

&nbsp;

**Why CVM:**

CEL-SCI says even with new treatments being researched and discussed. The use case for Multikine will remain because it is administered BEFORE starting any other treatments. The objective is to extend the life span with a certain quality for patients to receive treatment and prevail. This is also the largest study of head and neck cancer to date. 

&nbsp;

**Positions:**

300 Shares. Planning on upping to 500 EOD.

**Additional Stats:**

Short Interest: 20.70%

Harsh truth: Probably won’t happen


For Fun: By the year 2053, you will need $132,225 a year to have the equivalent of $60k in today’s money. The current yield of the S&P500 is 1.43%. This means you’d need $9.2M invested by the age of 65 to be able to live off dividends. However I assume you’re used to a much more expensive lifestyle because 5k a month is what you’re willing to throw at stocks. At 5k a month until you’re 65 you’d end up with around $6.5 million. 


Another harsh truth: Honestly there’s no logical basis for you to prefer cash from a dividend over cash from selling shares before taxes and fees.

> I saw someone mention the Eaton ETV fund on here but after doing a lot of looking online etc I don't see it mentioned much. Given it's over 8% dividend etc why isn't this fund more popular? 


Because it’s had a historically poor performance. You would’ve blasted yourself in the foot by investing in that. 


Also don’t take advice from here very seriously. This sub and Reddit in general is full of novices who think they’re better than Warren Buffett. That confidence is often borne out of ignorance. 


> Is it worth investing thousands a month into this fund? Is there something else more attractive?


It would be better to invest in a good balanced portfolio of index funds or a target date fund or two depending how hands-on you want to be. 


Target Date Funds, the most hands-off approach: 


VFIFX: 2050 Target date fund 


VFFVX: 2055 Target date fund 


VTTSX: 2060 Target date fund. 


If you want a more hands-on approach that will give you the best results, go with index funds: 


https://www.bogleheads.org


r/bogleheads 


VTI: US Total market fund


VXUS: Total International 


AGG: US Aggregate Bond Fund 


What I’ve heard some people do is look at the Target date fund’s holdings and then mimic it with their index funds for a cheaper expense ratio. Example: 


VFFVX’s holdings: 

54% in VTI 

36.3% in VXUS

That's a very straight forward goal :-) - With that amount of money and the idea of early retirement, I suggest you get real financial advice from a financial advisor. I did that with less money to invest and other goals, and it was free at my bank, maybe around 4-6 hours of talking and figuring out what's best for me and what I want to achieve.

mklovn,gtghzwv,stocks,comment,1617633700,"They're a sham company. I am a broker in NYC and was recruited by them. I declined their offer.

They're living off of SoftBank's investment. They tout themselves as a tech company but literally advertise listings from other brokerages that rented or sold years ago. 

They offer crazy signing bonuses and commission splits. It's not sustainable. I know many people who left their brokerage to work for compass and then to subsequently go back to their previous brokerage.

Something about them is fundamentally flawed. Stock might do well but for someone in the industry I hate that company and sense they will implode sooner rather than later.",

The problem is, holding this expensive stock prevents me from purchasing more blue chips and ETFs. Having 0 dividend is another thing. 

Would it be a mistake to sell GOOGL now? If I sold it, I would buy some ETFs that have a fair share of GOOGL in it, but not too reliant on IT&Tech. I already own enough of those and I would like to buy more blue chips I already own (JNJ, PG, WMT to name a few) and also look for dividend-paying ETFs (currently own VIG).

The burn a lot of money with projects that lead nowhere
no dividend and no voting rights that matter (50% is the founders, no matter how much stock you own)

I think it will be compounding over the long run, a lot of cashflow will be burned on the hobbyprojects of the company but eventually some will work out.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/bill-hwang-archegos.html?referringSource=articleShare

“Until recently, Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out.

Mr. Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March, Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS, effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure, since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments, called derivatives, created by the banks.

That changed in late March, after shares of ViacomCBS fell precipitously and the lenders demanded their money. When Archegos couldn’t pay, they seized its assets and sold them off, leading to one of the biggest implosions of an investment firm since the 2008 financial crisis.”

Also, from another article, interesting that “Unlike holdings of shares, which require investors to report ownership above 5 percent in a single stock, over-the-counter equity swaps offer exposure to stocks without the SEC reporting requirements of shareholdings.”",['VIAC']

mktwex,,stocks,post,1617654022,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 5, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 5, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.

>“As the No.1 provider of servers in the world, you can be sure we’re taking advantage of all the latest ingredients that allow us to provide the best solution out there,” said Dell in an interview with CRN. “[Intel CEO] Pat Gelsinger is a great friend and the Ice Lake generation of microprocessors from Intel offer remarkable improvements across all the performance characteristics that are super important. Having said that, there are other microprocessors out there.”

This is some very important commentary. Dell has historically produced a few, more niche, AMD-powered bare-metal and edge options, with Intel as the default chip manufacturer/architecture for their broader server offerings. It sounds like they may be reconsidering that which would be an absolutely monstrous blow to Intel as their consumer chip business is already eroding significantly.

APPH, AGFY, HYFM. And UGRO

All are fairly recent IPOs. They all seem worthwhile and I've owned them all at one point. SV with Aerofarms is another, it seems. But to me, the very under the radar and now best valued pick is the last one -- UGRO

It uplisted recently and got mentioned in some newsletter it seemed and had a ridiculous run. Now it's settled down. I've been accumulating simply based on the fundamentals and because it remains deeply undervalued despite having a sterling balance sheet now, great earnings, and expansion into Europe and more backlog than ever. Market cap of 69 million, with tiny float of 4.75 million (https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UGRO -- all the PR and news is listed here, too). It's also notable that they don't seem to specialize (or even mention) cannabis and are focused on all manner of ""controlled environment agriculture"": https://urban-gro.com/ To my mind, this gives them more pick and shovels appeal as a ""pure play"" agriculture company, not a ""weed"" one with all the baggage and gyrations that carries.

""long_investor"" at ST (https://stocktwits.com/symbol/UGRO) has done amazing DD and here is a comment from him laying out the details:

""revenues grew 115% from 1st half of 2020 to 2nd half of 2020: From $8.2M to $17.6M (once Covid lockdown supply issues resolved). 

$9.2M reported today for Q4 alone is 30% growth over prior Q4. And most recent two qtrs UGRO turned EBITDA positive. 
$50M
 in cash still, as of yesterday 3/30/21. 

In Q1/2020, 
$UGRO
 had $4.3M in revs. Fast forward one year, entering Q1/2021, UGRO already had 
$14M
+ of signed contracts. What % growth will the next ER show over Q1/2020? And in Q2/2020, UGRO had 
$4M
 in revs. How about the YoY growth for this Q2’s ER? 

Depends on how many projects they completed. Though given they just reported $9.2M for Q4 revenues, odds seem good for our tiny micro-cap to show very significant growth compared to the $4.3M and 
$4M
 from Q1 and Q2 of 2020.""",['MMM']

Open interest for 4/16 30c was around 19000 contracts on Thursday morning, ($28.00 at the time), and closed $29.04 with some heavy action battling that $29.00 line for whatever reason.  During AH trading it reached $30.00, and which may or may not mean SOME of these 19000 contracts have not been hedged yet.

In the video, the CEO explained that the merger would be beneficial to Seneca shareholders, who are frustrated with historical stock performance. He went on to explain that through the merger, Seneca shareholders will enjoy ownership in a company with a world-class management team, several valuable ts, and a focus on providing shareholder value. 

Leading BioSciences has a strong pipeline of gastrointestinal drugs and a management team that has a strong history of performance.

mk0ayq,,stocks,post,1617556151,"Are stock trading courses mostly bullshit?Someone told me that stock trading courses are bullshit 95 % of the time, their reasoning being the following:

1. If the stock trader actually has a good strategies, they won't bother spending time on teaching other people.
2. Teaching other people their strategies is harmful to their business because ""it's pretty much just a war of different strategies"".

I don't quite see the logic here. First of all, the traders can have time to both trade stocks and teach courses. Surely with all the algorithms and with partners/assitants, they can make time to teach courses. Now, maybe the money they'd make from these courses would be such a drop in the bucket compared to their stock earnings, making it again pointless. I'm not sure about this, but a friend of mine is paying a quite sizeable sum for a trading course, and in this digital age, he could be one of many. So, perhaps there is a lot of money to make on this.

As for the second point: surely there are many instances where cooperation is most beneficial. As a teacher of a course, one has a lot of influence over the students, being able to perhaps tell them to invest in certain businesses that would benefit them all.

So, from my point of view, it doesn't make sense that being a teacher in a stock trading course means that one is most likely scamming the students. What do you guys think about this?",

mjrul6,,stocks,post,1617522821,"Long term stocksWhat stocks are you buying and holding for the next 5-20 years? 

It’s pretty obvious that technology will be as big as ever - Im in Apple and Microsoft 

Electric cars will be huge - I’m in Tesla 

Disney - Disney plus set to overtake Netflix, Disney theme parks will expand and grow ( I’m in Disney) 

Cash is slowing being removed from society - I’m in PayPal, square, visa, jp Morgan 

Yolo play - I’m in pltr (got in cheap) I believe there’s a high chance of it being massive in the future

Gaming - I’m in draftkings, competitive gaming is a growing industry

My long holds might be obvious but Disney, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Nintendo, Google, Square, PayPal, Enphase and my genomics pie (Beam, Crspr, Pacb, and NVTA are the largest %) are all in my 10 year portfolio.

I'm with you on PLTR. Not as confident in them as my other holdings but they're a company that excites me and I'm willing to hold them as a high risk play.


Do you have any e-commerce holdings? Amazon and Etsy are two of my favourites. I think e-commerce only accounts for 9% of retail expenditure atm so there's still so much room for growth in the sector, crazy as it seems and I expect the pandemic to act as a catalyst for more people who previously avoided online shopping to now be in the funnel.","['TSLA', 'ETSY', 'PYPL', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']"

Trash companies.  Humans will always make trash that needs to be picked up.  I like Covanta.  They pick up trash then burn the trash to make electricity.  They get paid to pick up the trash and then to make electricity from it.

On thinking long term on stocks, metaphorically prefer to not dig gold out of the ground (sell discretionary items to people).  Rather sell the picks, shovels and food - things they need not want.

I’m getting back into casual investing after taking a few years off to be a broke college student. I’ve had some success in years past buying calls with about two years on them for companies like GE and Wells Fargo. I see a lot of upside potential there because of the low implied volatility and limited downside in the short-term because there’s plenty of time left.

I’m open to just about any sector, but I’d prefer to kind of stay away from tech so I’m not overexposed. Right now the only thing I hold is an Apple call through July.

mk3snc,gtdt6qp,stocks,comment,1617569114,"I have a sizeable position in CHPT around 22.

CHPT is better for the following reasons, of course, imo:

1.) Old board member of CHPT is a part of Biden's administration

2.) CHPT does have level 3 stations. They also sell NEMA 14-50s.

3.) TSLA is a closed network. I never see other cars at TSLA stations.

4.) Some cars cannot level 3 charge.

5.) The grid cannot support all chargers being level 3. It is likely that government contracts will be for mostly level 2 chargers and some level 3 chargers. Most gov businesses close after 4:30, so charging overnight is not going to be an issue.

EDIT: Forgot to add, CHPT is actually currently valued higher. These are the reasons why it is probably valid and also explains the recent run.

Good morning everyone,

here are my new ideas for the next week. As usual, you will find additional info + my Charts in a PDF under the Google-Drive Link:

[PDF with additional TA, Charts and Financials](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MvQCqt8d6bSQepoztL74tTR3NZIXthHG/view?usp=sharing)

This week, I focussed on 2 Tech-Stocks that were not hit that hard by the recent selloff, one promising BioTech-Stock, one from the Energy-Sector that might benefit from the upcoming restructure of the $ICLN and the last one is Plant/Seed Consumer-Play with recent Insider-Grants and Buys.

Here are quick summaries:

**Corsair Gaming**

Was not that affected by the massive Tech-Selloff.

Re-Claimed all 3 EMA’s in the past week – I believe that it will be picked up again by Funds/HF-Algos once it will trade above $35

Very strong fundamentals, solid financial numbers.

Although it is a tech-growth stock, Corsair is kinda an old company with a very strong position in the E-Sports/Gaming Sector.

Could be played as a Mid-Swing but also as a Long-Hold.

I would add a starter now/at $35 and slowly scale in.

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/02/my-3-favorite-stocks-right-now/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/02/my-3-favorite-stocks-right-now/)

**Corvus Pharmaceuticals**

Was beaten down by public offering & earnings. Fundamentals are not that great, but Analysts are very bullish on hit, and the 2.5x median price target is something to look for.

\- Several catalysts Phase 2/3 in 2021

\- Major ownership on “Angel Pharma”  Chinese Market

\- [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corvus-pharmaceuticals-provides-business-reports-123000328.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corvus-pharmaceuticals-provides-business-reports-123000328.html)

**Limelight Networks**

“Limelight Networks is one of the best-positioned CDN providers that focuses on providing services to on-demand live video, web content, and software and digital media providers. It has the likes of Amazon, Comcast, Sony, Walt Disney as its customers. As one of the best CDN service providers, with strong infrastructure and steady growth, the company may have some value. Execution remains the main issue, and that too in a competitive environment, to justify significant upside”

They are not profitable yet, although they have a very good customer base. I would play this as a recovery/earnings-play, then sell-off with a good profit. Wait for the fall after earnings and the buy-in again for a longer hold.

**NextEra Energy**

[https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)

ICLN will be 3x and change its holding mid-April.

While there will be a lot of selling pressure on $PLUG and other holdings, $NEE might be included and therefore benefit from that.

“In that scenario, ETFs tracking the index would need to buy all of the freshly added stocks, as well as increasing their holdings in some existing constituents.

This would mean the iShares ETFs would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted, and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind, and GCL-Poly Energy.”

**Calyxt**

Agriculture/Seed-Play; Very High Insider & Institutional Ownership

Wait for the price above the EMA’s, then scale in

I've been a lurker for 2 years and only created this account recently. Anyways, I want to hear some people's opinions on here about two different strategies I've been mind juggling for a while now.

The strategy of never selling is simple and what I pretty much stuck with since I started investing until recently. I think it's best to never sell if you plan on investing some money here and there into some long term funds or ETFs. But recently (late last year before this massive rotation) I sold profits on a few stocks that I did really well on and reinvested into a bunch of other things. I was doing really well on all of my picks, and with these past 2 months all of my precious gains disappeared. Of course, hindsight is a bitch, and I wish I had taken profits on most of those and then bought the dip because I still have a strong conviction. Which leaves me thinking about a new strategy, specifically for my volatile growth stonks.

The strategy of profit taking would have me taking some profits here and there if I make a certain % amount, and then keeping that cash as buying power for dips, bears and rotations. I think this works really well with volatile growth stocks because volatile growth stocks have shown to be able to run up anywhere from 15-50% in a single day or even more depending on the stock. I don't have many stonks like those, but I do have stocks that rally and pullback. If a certain sector or security I'm invested in grows a significant amount in a couple weeks or a couple months, it will almost definitely pullback soon after. This mindset would also help me not feel as bad about selling during a bear market.",

# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.
*****
> The U.S. Labor Department’s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.
*****
> The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute’s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> “Literally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We’re coming off a low base,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks — unless interest rates rise too quickly.
*****
> Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.
*****
> On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.
*****
> The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.
*****
> The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.
*****
> # All eyes on earnings
> “The macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That will be the next thing to turn to.”
*****
> He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.
*****
> First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.
*****
> Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.
*****
> “Approximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,” noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
> Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.
*****
> “In each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.
*****
> “Our work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2½–3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,” Golub wrote.
*****
> # April is far from cruelest month
Aside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.
*****
> Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that’s constructive for stocks.
*****
> The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&P 500, trading on the CBOE.
*****
> Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.
*****
> Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.
*****
> “The bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.
*****
> “April is usually good. It’s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It’s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.
*****
> The market enters the “sell in May” period during the second quarter. The market adage, “sell in May and go away,” is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.
*****
> “In that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,” Stovall said. “Tech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
> The producer price index — which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output — will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.
*****
> As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
> Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.
*****
> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.

> # Stocks Love April

> “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Mark Twain

> What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Just how strong has April been lately? “I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Other than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:

> # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After

> Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.

> # A Humble Victory Lap

> It has been a little over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It’s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.

> It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie—a lesson we always keep in mind.

> “Few on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‘what have you done for me lately’ industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.”

> Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.

*****

> # Turn Off, Tune Out

> The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.

> Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.

> Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**

> In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**

> At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.

> # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.

> As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**

> That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**

> As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.

> # Stocks and Inflation

> As we continue LPL Research’s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow’s blog, where we’ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.

> Looking at S&P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “You can’t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that’s under control is a tailwind for stocks,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.”

> Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> The inflation question is one that isn’t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn’t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.

1. VUSA - 10000 / 55 (price per share in Jan 2020) = 181.8 shares.
Today VUSA is at 65$, so that means a 10 increase.

**COPPER**

[https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/](https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/)

Copper prices rose on 8th Feb as optimism around a US stimulus raised hopes of higher demand for metals and a recovery in the world’s biggest economy.

The copper price rose as much as 1.3% to $3.6745 ($8,100 a tonne) on the Comex market on Monday, with March delivery contracts back within shouting distance of multi-year highs hit early in January.

The metal has rallied nearly 90% since the depth of the pandemic in March.

Thinning inventories

The rise in copper prices is underpinned by thinning inventories that pointed to higher demand for the industrial metal.

“Inventories are still quite low on exchanges. That gives good indication that manufacturing demand for copper is present and that its not just a speculative story,” Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree, [told Reuters.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)

In China, the world’s top consumer, copper inventories normally accumulate in the run up to the Lunar New Year as businesses close for the week-long festivities.

But this year, Chinese inventories have [dropped to near decade lows ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)on robust demand from factories, which are maintaining high operating rates due to shortened shutdown periods and tighter travel restrictions for workers.

Meanwhile, effects of the [coronavirus pandemic on copper supply](https://www.mining.com/web/worlds-copper-mines-struggle-to-recover-from-covid-19-andy-home/) continues to be felt. In what was supposed to be a year of supply growth, global mined output during the first 10 months of 2020 were 0.5% lower compared to 2019 levels, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG).

In Peru, the world’s second-biggest producer, copper output plunged 12.5% to 2.15 million tonnes in 2020, the country’s Energy and Mines Ministry said on [8th Feb](https://www.mining.com/web/peru-reports-sharp-drop-in-2020-copper-production-due-to-pandemic/).

Copper miners gain

Despite copper prices hitting a slump in the second half of January, the world’s top copper producers have continued to rally this year after spectacular gains in 2020.

**Shares of BHP, the largest publicly traded copper company**, are up 6% year-to-date.

Copper, like most commodities, has been a cyclical investment whose demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. Traditionally, roughly half of all copper demand has come from new building construction and infrastructure, China has been the single biggest market by far. With many global economies in or entering recovery phases, cyclical demand is on the upswing. 

Green initiatives around the world offer a secular tailwind as well. The European Green Deal, President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate plan, and China’s target of carbon neutral by 2060 all point to increasing incremental demand for copper. 

Although mining stocks have in many cases quadrupled since their March 2020 lows, many names are still trading below their previous highs, and at a time when fundamentals are improving.

Take [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/fcx), $FCX, a Phoenix-based company whose business is roughly 70% copper, 20% gold, and 10% other. The stock plummeted to $7 a share during the selloff last spring and has since recovered to a recent $30. But it is still about half what it was at previous highs of around $60 in early 2008 and 2011.  

The big news on copper last month was regarding $RIO and the Mongolian situation.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia's government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the OyuTolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported.

[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep\_id:3650](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep_id:3650)

Many thought this was potentially bad news for $RIO, but it appears it's about working out a little more tax dollars for the government and a deal will be struck.

**The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world’s biggest copper mines**

Global copper demand

As mentioned above, it’s not likely that copper demand will slow down in 2021.

In the US, new home and home renovation demand spiked since the pandemic started, along with electronics demand. Analysts at CitiBank expect the copper market to shift into a deficit in the second half of the year with a minor surplus overall for 2021, Reuters reported. They also forecast deficits in 2022 and 2023.

The US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.

China will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.

According to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China’s refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.

Indonesian copper smelter

Indonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia’s Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.

“The smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,” the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.

mjoatm,gtbdp3t,stocks,comment,1617509201,"I’m not too terribly sure who they are sold through specifically, but when insiders do buy or sell as well as exercise options of their company’s shares, they have to file those transactions with the SEC. You can either go onto the sec website to see what insiders are doing with their shares (although searching is kind of a pain) or you can go onto Finviz under the insiders tab and see recent transactions that were filed as recent as the end of the trading day. If your investing for medium or long term, even swing trading and/or options, these are good things to look at as ceo’s, majority, or +10% holders usually know when it’s a good time to buy or sell shares of their own company.

mjoatm,gtbjjbm,stocks,comment,1617513647,"They’re different situations, though can cross over. 

A)An insider - generally an employee or an associate thereof - is someone who has access to inside information - that is, market sensitive knowledge about a corporate and its prospects (or what those prospects might be) that is not yet public (ie known by anyone who is not an insider). Like a member of the board, senior management, traders, compliance, etc.  

Due to the level of understanding such people have about matters actually or potentially how a corporate’s share price might react to whatever knowledge they have, freedom to trade in securities issued by that corporate such people have is restricted heavily, by law and regulation, to prevent them gaining an unfair advantage over the rest of the market, by knowing better when to buy, or sell. Firm, right requirements that must be met before such people are permitted to trade instruments in the corporate are imposed in most, maybe all, jurisdictions, and failure to abide by them carries prison time or big-steez financial retribution for anyone found to have used their knowledge to secure a gain or avoid a loss. 

An insider doesn’t need a lot of money to do wrong. None in fact. Telling someone else something you know so they can trade on it - also illegal. Think fund managers telling wife or kids or friend - the person who knows doesn’t actually trade - they just pass on things they shouldn’t.  

Now....

B)Having a large long position in a corporate you don’t work for, with, or is different. Owning a sizeable stake in a corporate gives influence, in most cases. But unless one of your employees is on the corporate’s board or books, your access to inside information is (or should be) unaffected, if the corporate and share holder understand their market abuse obligations. Those being don’t trade on inside information - it’s unfair, distorts the market, and is therefore illegal- carrying both civil (money) and criminal (prison) penalties. 

To your question:

Both A and B forms of ‘enhanced’ dealing are often possible through retail brokers.  But:

A are individuals. Generally, retail brokers take care of individuals. 

B is usually going to be a massive investment house with a tonne of money they invest for other people. They ought to have a panel of brokers their traders may use. 

Many brokers offer both individual and institutional clients accounts. But they’re vastly different demographics. 

The wealthier a person or family is, the more likely one of the institutional lot will have a product/service that suits them. 

Mark zuckerberg - fuck me. No idea. Other than he’s not going to give Hargreaves Landsdown or TD Waterhouse £7.50 a trade or whatever it is they bag. He’ll have a special arrangement. Quite possibly with one of the big investment banks. Quite possibly with a few of them. And he probably pays someone to deal with all of it, in a way that ensures the maximum possible is attributable to activities of his charitable foundation, minimising by doing so any tax bill IRS or any other global tax authorities might seek to wave in his face. 

Warping back to earth..... a normal person with a lot of money but not a stupid Mark Z amount....

- More than 10-25m depending, a big investment bank might be bothered to take them on 
- Otherwise, they might need to divvy it up between a couple of retail-facing brokers; most have a maximum investment of something like 5m, because more than that, you’re getting closer to the possibility of anything coming in being ill-gotten gains, which no one wants to deal with, but the investment banks have the depth of compliance / legal lot to
- 1. Check the source of funds more deeply; then 
- 2. Tell the regulator to fuck off if questions get raised 

That’s basically it.",

mkqvd7,,investing,post,1617645968,"Lockheed Martin buys up to 58 launches over the next decade from rocket builder ABL SpaceRocket builder ABL Space signed a long-term agreement for multiple launches with Lockheed Martin, agreeing to provide the defense giant with as many as 58 rockets through the end of the decade.

Lockheed Martin will buy up to 26 of ABL’s RS1 rockets through 2025, with an option for up to 32 additional launches through 2029, ABL announced on Monday.

“Having this assured access to space will accelerate our ability to demonstrate the spacecraft and associated payload technologies we are developing to the meet the future mission needs for our customers,” Lockheed Martin Space executive vice president Rick Ambrose said in a press release.

ABL’s RS1 rocket fits in the middle of the launch marketplace, between Rocket Lab’s small Electron and SpaceX’s large Falcon 9 vehicle. RS1 is nearly 90 feet tall and is designed to launch as much as 1,350 kg (nearly 1½ tons) of payload to low Earth orbit.

Lockheed Martin’s venture arm is one of ABL’s early investors, with the company having raised about $220 million in private capital so far – the majority of which came in a round from T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Management last month at a $1.3 billion valuation.

ABL declined to comment on the financial terms of the contract. Based on ABL’s $12 million price tag for an RS1 rocket, the deal with Lockheed Martin is estimated to be worth nearly $700 million over eight years, assuming the maximum number of launches.
Notably, as ABL’s rockets utilize a mobile ground system called GS0 that can pack into a few shipping containers, Lockheed Martin may use a variety of launch facilities around the world – including U.S. Space Force facilities at Vandenberg in California and Cape Canaveral in Florida.

While the defense giant did not specify which missions it plans to launch with ABL’s rockets, Lockheed Martin previously announced in February that it had selected ABL to launch a mission from Scotland in 2022. Additionally, Lockheed Martin last month signed a strategic partnership with satellite start-up Omnispace, with the latter company planning to launch a constellation of satellites to build a 5G communications network in space.

The large contract represents a coup for ABL in the medium-lift segment of the launch market, where the company is competing with Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, which reached orbit a few months ago.

Other competitors in that arena include Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace, which are aiming to launch for the first time later this year. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab is developing a medium-lift rocket called Neutron that it expects to launch by 2024.

ABL continues to work toward its inaugural RS1 launch from Vandenberg.

While ABL had previously hoped to be ready to launch as early as March, president Dan Piemont said that the company is now aiming “for flight readiness by June.” The rocket builder recently finished acceptance testing on the first RS1 fuel tank, but Piemont said ABL expects the required launch site regulatory approvals will delay its first launch attempt to the third quarter of this year.",['LMT']

mkpudd,,investing,post,1617643228,"Arcimoto ($FUV) valuation compared to other EV companiesArcimoto ($FUV) is currently trading at a slightly under $500M valuation. Many other companies (especially SPACs) with fewer vehicles produced/sold to date and less clear plans to scale have multi-billion dollar valuations. For example, Nikola ($NKLA) $5B, Lordstown ($RIDE) $2B, and Workhorse ($WKHS) $1.7B.

In the last year, Arcimoto produced and sold \~100 vehicles to customers. They are planning to scale production capacity to 50k/year in 2022 in their new factory. Some companies valued over $1B still mainly have drawings and a couple of prototypes.

Arcimoto's produces inexpensive, 3-wheeled vehicles which makes them less of a direct competitor with Tesla ($TSLA). Direct competition from Tesla poses a real risk to the profitability of other EV players long term.

Arcimoto has gained pretty good traction and support from the Tesla community with Gali from Hyperchange on Arcimoto's board, their partnership with Sandy Munro, and Rob Mauer (Tesla Daily podcast) and Ross Gerber disclosing investments in $FUV.

mjwo8q,,investing,post,1617544552,"Waste Connections (WCN) and waste in general: Material beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure policiesThe waste industry is more than just hard-working gentlemen and women collecting trash from your home or business. It is an extensive ecosystem which is the backbone underpinning a growing economy. Waste Connections operations stand to materially benefit from the industrial and residential waste offshoot in light of Biden’s infrastructure plan, which targets growth in transportation and logistics in and to secondary markets (in which WCN dominates): 

*“The American Jobs Plan will build new rail corridors and transit lines, easing congestion, cutting pollution, slashing commute times, and opening up investment in communities that can be connected to the cities, and cities to the outskirts, where a lot of jobs are these days.  It’ll reduce the bottlenecks of commerce at our ports and our airports.” –* [*Biden speech on American Jobs Plan, March 31 2021*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-american-jobs-plan/)

Furthermore, the plan aims for a complete overhaul of critical infrastructure including the replacement of all lead water piping. Biden aims to further jumpstart American manufacturing output by increasing factories in primary and secondary markets. The industrial and residential waste byproduct of Biden’s plan will materially increase collection and processing volumes at municipal an non-municipal solid waste landfills, of which WCN owns and operates 74 in secondary regions.

WCN focuses on secondary and rural markets as opposed to urban cities, and is able to achieve industry leading margins due to lack of competition resulting in strong pricing power and low customer churn. Over 40% of solid waste revenues are generated under exclusive arrangements (Residential: 7 years or longer for rural; municipal shorter in nature and have competitive bidding process — Commercial, industrial, and E&P service agreements typically range from 1-5 years). WCN vertically integrates its waste collection business with owning and operating landfills and transfer stations in key markets which further serves as a strategic advantage, capping competition. 

It maintains incredible pricing power drives single digit annual increases to recurring revenues; 13.1% CAGR since 2014; and industry leading free cash flow and earnings margins vs. peers. 

In sum, WCN is a high-quality, defensive name providing an essential service in an increasingly competitive environment. Given its industry-leading growth profile, robust (and sustainable) FCF generation, and dominance of secondary markets, you should consider the company a core holding and a safe play against volatility. It continues to innovate in the recycling and green energy conversion space, both catalysts to future growth and investment. As economies continue to open and the world resumes full-tilt, expect volumes and earnings growth to catapult.

Perimeter Medical Imaging AI announced that Dr. Beth DuPree, a surgeon at Northern Arizona Healthcare Verde Valley Medical Center, expects to enroll up to 100 patients in a study that will evaluate the use of Perimeter’s Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging System during breast conserving surgery.

&#x200B;

Highlights of this press release:

•	The clinical study led by Dr. DuPree aims to demonstrate that surgeons can effectively use Perimeter’s OCT Imaging System during a clinical procedure to aid their decisions;

•	The data will calculate the percentage of patients that require a second surgery; (The goal is to reduce re-operation rate)

•	Perimeter continues working closely with clinician users to ensure that the Perimeter OCT Imaging System can be easily integrated into current intraoperative workflows.

Read the full press release: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005377/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005377/en/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The company has recently received the US FDA 510(k) clearance on the advanced OCT imaging tools, which marks an important milestone that we are now in the commercialization stage. On top of that, we have just added $8.3MM to the balance sheet due to warrant exercise, and this funds will be contributing to the sales efforts going forward.

I’m pretty sure their candidate is meant to fight all Covid-19 variants, utilizing the mRNA approach (that has worked for Pfizer, Moderna) in combination with a component that amplifies T-Cell response.

Seems like positive news, not to mention they have a $500K investment from the Gates Foundation and a $785 million deal signed with Gilead in Feb. Considering Gilead bought $30M of GRTS equity when it was trading at $25-35, $10 here looks like a steal.

Pretty sure GRTS is at $10-11 rn, after the recent rate scare. But at <$500M market cap rn, GRTS looks like a fat steal. Interested in hearing everyone’s thoughts!

“Space is already an invisible backbone to our economy and we think that’s only going to become more so as [satellite] constellations launch,” Ark Invest analyst Sam Korus told CNBC’s Morgan Brennan on “Power Lunch.”

Shares of ARKX slipped about 1% in its first day of trading, with the stock closing at $20.30 a share.

ARKX’s 39 stocks includes pure-play space companies like Iridium and Virgin Galactic, as well as defense and aerospace giants such as Kratos, L3Harris, Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

But the ETF also includes names not traditionally connected to the space industry, such Chinese e-commerce firms JD.com and Alibaba, or agriculture businesses like Trimble and Deere.

“We’ve all seen the memes going around on Twitter,” Korus said, acknowledging public skepticism of ARKX’s holdings.

“The fact that people are dismissing this out of hand is very reassuring to us, and kind of demonstrates the type of research that we’re doing and how we can be unique,” he added.

Korus gave the example of Netflix, which has a 1.25% weighting in ARKX.

“Netflix ... has 200 million paying subscribers. In the U.S. alone, there’s over 40 million people who don’t have access to broadband and so, if a satellite solution can bring access to those customers and expand the addressable market and the topline for Netflix, then this is something that is very important,” Korus said.

While none of the seven SPACs that recently announced mergers with space companies are in ARKX, Korus noted that Ark is “constantly evaluating these companies.”

“I think with SPACs it’s important to remember that a lot these are almost at the pre-IPO stage,” Korus said. “We really want to be sure that we’re picking the winners long term, particularly in aerospace – where many companies do go bust and things get delayed.”","['TWTR', 'LMT', 'TRMB', 'BA', 'DE', 'NFLX']"

""This may be surprising for some,but I’m going to try to explain why in my opinion this is an undervalued,and misunderstood company. First you have to understand southern car culture. There isn’t a lot to do in the southern states,and middle america. This results in most people pouring money into their cars as one of their main hobbies. My brother owns a performance car shop in west virginia. He told me yesterday that this has been his busiest month in the last 5 years since he started. This is because people have gotten their stimulus checks or saved during the whole pandemic and now that the summer is approaching once again what is one of the things they are going to do with their money? They want to upgrade their car. I asked him which businesses he thinks are benefiting the most from the uptick. One of the first and the only public company he listed is Holley “They pretty much have a near monopoly on a lot of the aftermarket parts especially classic cars and classic trucks parts”

Now that I have somewhat explained the culture and why I think the company is getting a huge uptick from stimulus checks.let's get into the meat,and potatoes of this trade. This is a spac at near nav($10.20). This company is only valued $1.5b despite having 580m revenue last year and 25% YOY growth. They are rapidly taking over the aftermarket part market through acquisitions. Including expanding into the aftermarket EV car market. In my opinion this is a low risk - medium to high return trade.""

mjvnrw,,investing,post,1617540633,"Energy Transfer ($ET) DD from discord that I wrote.   This is a DD I wrote for a discord I’m in with some friends. 

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

     Let me know what y’all think, would love to hear some opinions. This is my largest DD write up so far and would love some tips for future ones I want to do.","['GOOGL', 'NOV']"

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.",

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k).

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality. 

Those continuing to back fossil fuels are equivalent to those who invested in horses and buggies in 1904.  //",['DE']

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

mj2qmk,,investing,post,1617430149,"Drd gold , a vertical growth gold mine(first dd, constructional critism will be welcomed)
disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",
mj2qmk,gt9lulr,investing,comment,1617472924,"I'm not an expert by any means, but maybe I can help you examine this in some more detail because on the surface this does look interesting.

Most of my gold mining knowledge (which is not much) comes from my time working as a land surveyor [in Colorado gold country.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B047'33.2%22N+105%C2%B031'33.3%22W/@39.792556,-105.5281017,700m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d39.7925558!4d-105.5259125) All those piles of brown from there all the way south and west beyond Idaho Springs are tailings, and there's still gold up in them there mountains. From what I understand, this stuff is exactly what this company would be targeting for processing, but currently the tailings in CO are just being sat on until gold reaches a threshold price where the owner will then start processing the tailings at a profit. I don't know what that threshold is but it hasn't happened yet and there hasn't been activity here since the early 1980s.

So my questions, and these are intended to dig a little deeper, maybe think about things from a different angle and stress test your bullish hypothesis, I'm not trying to shit on your DD or anything: 

1.  Are they purely a tailings-processing company now or do they also operate traditional mines? Looks like purely tailings now, but you also mentioned looking at surface mining internationally in the future.
2. What are their current reserves? Do they have enough tailings in SA to keep them busy at current levels until 2023? 2025? 2030? Their plan seems to be focused on SA until 2026 so I'm trying to get at the scale of revenue and earnings growth for the next 5 years here. Basically if they stay in SA the jump they saw in 2020 may plateau once they hit full operating capacity until they scale up internationally.
3. Specifically related to gold tailings, are the tailings in South Africa more concentrated? Or is DRD's process more cost-effective than traditional processing and allows them to profitably process tailings at a lower price of gold? If their process is significantly and demonstrably more cost-effective then that could be a big disruptive factor for the company. If it's just that the tailings in SA are better quality, then I'm more skeptical.
4. What was the investment required to build the processing plant? And if they expand internationally, will they have to build plants locally, work with local companies (sort of leasing their process), or ship the tailings to their SA plant?
5. Has processing platinum tailings begun? If so when did it begin or if not when is it expected to begin?
6. If platinum isn't up and running, there's more risk inherent there in that case. What is the difference between gold tailings and platinum tailings? Is it a similar process (using the same methods and chemicals) or is it significantly different? Can we expect similar margins from this as the gold?
7. What's their competition here? What other companies are in the gold/platinum tailings processing space?

I don't expect you'd have all the answers to these questions, but maybe there's some things there to think about.

In short, I'm intrigued. If their processing is indeed more cost-effective than traditional tailings processing, then long term that's potentially a good sign for big growth and big scaling. That would mean a potential disruptive factor within that industry and would provide a good competitive moat/advantage. If the jump is simply related to getting a plant up and running and processing high-quality trailings, then I'd expect the growth to stabilize once platinum is up and running (if it's not already) and they'd be more vulnerable to competition especially once they start trying to scale internationally.",

* I also used GOOGLEFINANCE to fetch some of the prices. Seems that stockanalysis, finviz and googlefinance don't always agree which investment product a ticker represents (e.g. TILT) so there can be some data mistakes.
* mostly works for companies listed on US exchanges

I did this for my amusement, it's not investment advice.

For some ETFs that saw a huge dip, e.g. ARKK or ARKW, the computed target was close to the historical maximum, so I wonder how much price bias is there in the target price published by analysts (i.e., analysists try to reason current price, rather than coming up with a proper valuation).

I'm going to track this for a while to see how useful this information is.

Edit 1: I explained here how I computed the table: https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mijk9h/i_computed_the_weighted_average_upside_for_100/gt563uy. tl;dr:  ETF's upside is computed from the allocation weighted upside of the individual stocks comprising the ETF.

Edit 3: The calculation doesn't work for leveraged ETFs (they are not tied to the underlying price of the company, beta decay is a think with leveraged etfs). Also it doesn't work with non-US listed stocks (e.g. finviz doesn't have data for the ESPO stocks https://stockanalysis.com/etf/espo/holdings/)","['AAPL', 'ARKK']"

A lot of this ground has been covered already by places like The Bear Cave but here are some highlights: 

\- This team’s collective experience seems significantly more limited than that of other firms. Only about half the current team came to ARK with a history of full-time work.

\- Wood assembles the portfolio one stock at a time, using each stock’s cumulative scores as a guide to position sizing. But these scores say nothing of each stock’s sources of risk and return, which may be highly and undesirably correlated to one another.

\- The portfolio has become less liquid and more vulnerable to severe losses as its size has swelled. In the 12 months ended February 2021, the ETF’s assets under management grew more than tenfold to over $23 billion. It has retained and grown its stakes in small companies that are now much more difficult to sell without [materially impacting](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1027682) their stock prices. Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

People only use tether because it’s the cheapest option for getting  1 dollar US outside of the US. We don’t need it here for obvious reasons. But if Tether crashed people would move into other stable coins USDC and DAI. But there are other complications with that such as supply.

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

* ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.
* ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.
* HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia
* KRBN: tracks the carbon future price of the European Emission Trading Scheme and that in California. The best performing commodity in 2020, and arguably in the years to come. Unlike other commodities, the fundamental case is quite strong.

Going into college, there were a few things I really wanted to work towards purchasing. 
-boat
-atv
-something to haul them with (truck)
-house
-cabin 

I understood that it was a lot, but I figured I’d get a good job and get there one step at a time. 

I recently finished paying off my student debt (50k) four years after college (6 years out now). I lived way below my means to make this happen. Recently, I have gotten into investing and I am very focused on compound interest. I started maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, and also started a brokerage account for additional stocks. I continue to live below my means, and I like it that way. Investing makes me feel fulfilled, like I have a real goal I am working towards. 

When I think about those items mentioned above, I no longer get excited. I see them as mountains of debt. I want to buy a house, but I don’t want to do it in this seller’s market. The other items just seem like unnecessary obstacles to reaching my investment goals. I don’t make enough money to accomplish both.

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people. The thing with the USD is the inflation is pretty predictable, and prices relatively stay the same throughout the years. But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent.

mi3bt3,,investing,post,1617306304,"Micron Soars On Chip Shortage ""Perfect Storm""In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving
    Believes strength is likely to persist through much of calendar 2021 before potentially subsiding to more normal trends in calendar 2022","['AMAT', 'INTC', 'NVDA', 'WDC']"

You can't put in stop orders. Commission looks like is $7.95 no matter size but don't quote me on that. 

BTCC annual expense fee is 1%, EBIT is .75% and BTCX is .4%. AUM is 1 Bil for BTCC, 75mil for EBIT and 51mil for BTCX. 

GBTC for comparison has a 2% fee and is not an ETF.

GBTC is trading at a 9%+ discount to NAV, whereas an ETF trades (ideally) at a 0% premium/discount, plus whatever you lose on the bid/ask spread. The spread might be meaningful when trading in an international security with low volume.

Lower expense ratios are nice, but it takes 5+ years for the expense ratio savings in EBIT to compensate you for GBTC's discount. And that assumes the increasing competition doesn't force Grayscale to lower their fee in the coming months/years.

I'm sticking with GBTC for the foreseeable future.",
mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated deficit of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their deficit is increasing.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: SUNW doesn't make a profit, hasn't made a profit in over a decade, and doesn't appear to have any unique software, hardware, or business model.

I have been seeing, for the past few months, a lot of news regarding the Turkish lira and how it lost so much value and how Turkey's economy is in shambles, etc. Not only that but Erdogan doesn't make things easier and might very well take the country to total economic collapse.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision? As far as I see it, because the lira devalued so much, it would be much cheaper for someone holding other currencies.

mh6l6f,,investing,post,1617198775,"Goldman Sachs is close to offering bitcoin and other digital assets to its wealth management clientsGoldman Sachs is close to offering its first investment vehicles for bitcoin and other digital assets to clients of its private wealth management group, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The bank aims to begin offering investments in the emerging asset class in the second quarter, according to Mary Rich, who was recently named global head of digital assets for Goldman’s private wealth management division.

″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near term,” Rich said in an interview this week.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

Horizon 10-15 years

20K to begin with, topping at least 1K per month.

I’d be also inclined to tilt it a little towards growth and tech for the coming year.

15%  Nasdaq 100 (=QQQ) TER 0.30%

10%  S&P SmallCap 600 TER 0.375%
 
I’m not sure what to think of the overlap between Nasdaq and All-World. It adds exposure to that sector of course, but it tech has done so well over the past 5 years…
 
One alternative would be to keep it super simple and just go for All-World. There’s also a cheaper All-World option on my platform, although it hasn’t done as well as the Vanguard one.

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

mh8g4b,,investing,post,1617204139,"MKTY, the undiscovered biggest competitor of Riot and MaraEarly Feb, miners have been in a tailwind. Given high valuations of MARA and RIOT, I've been looking at under-the-radar companies operating in miners industry.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

**Conclusion**  
MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

mhaez0,,investing,post,1617209689,"ZDGE - 80% revenue growth at a 45 PE ratio offers 90% upside (DD)(First DD, constructive criticism appreciated)

**What is Zedge?**

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

&#x200B;

**Thanks for reading, and would like to hear any thoughts**

mhaez0,gsxqvf2,investing,comment,1617212160,"This may sound hand-wavey, and I suppose it is, but something doesn't smell good to me. The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up. Like I said, I don't know if this is true, and I didn't see an answer in my 5 second Google search. Having tried literally all options myself (/s), it's now up to you.",['GOOGL']
mhaez0,gsxplgr,investing,comment,1617211588,"Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

mh4gbw,,investing,post,1617191640,"My take on Gold's longterm outlookFrom a technical perspective, gold is in a 10 year long c[up and handle](https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1617190625002.png) pattern, and it could go sideways for many more years until a breakout target of about 2900 is met. The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",

mh1zc3,gswgjxp,investing,comment,1617186949,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['NDAQ', 'ADP', 'SPGI', 'DOW']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

I know that time in the market beats timing the market, but can't imagine that one should let such an opportunity slip (especially as it is a very young investment).

mgwrdt,,investing,post,1617159948,"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market. It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys. Stuff like WDI Corp, which runs restaurant chains:  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3068:JP

Edit 2: The model has settled down- now 2000-2500 a day in late April. That's still state of emergency level, but regular state of emergency level, such as closing restaurants early. Maybe better to just wait this out and buy the dip.",['GOOGL']

mgwrdt,gsvwq8o,investing,comment,1617169159,"To answer your question directly: 2 ways I can see. You can shortsell / buy puts on:

1. ALNPY - All nippon airways adr. No options but you wanna bet might as well go big if you think travel will take a hit
2. EWJ - if you just want a market level bet.

Let me know when you place the trade. As someone living in Tokyo, I'll happily take the other side of your trade. 

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

2. The largest Japanese stocks are carmakers, consumer electronics, and financial services. They aren't heavily tied to the vaccine & recovery trade (I could argue some may even be anti recovery).",

mgwz1w,,investing,post,1617160710,"FTC files suit against Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with GrailIn an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ftc-challenges-illuminas-proposed-acquisition-of-liquid-biopsy-firm-grail-11617131491

Personally I believe this will take some time to wash out and I expect a bigger correction in ILMN stock. I believe this represents an opportunity for entries into a long position in ILMN. I have a hard time believing this merger won’t go through.

mfs7vk,,investing,post,1617032204,"Stock Scraper Trending Data as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

Good luck and have fun all! Hope this helps someone!","['GOOGL', 'TWTR', 'AAPL']"

As of now, searching under Reddit all, there is roughly 450 tickers under 500. So you will then go through the 450 tockers and delete any that aren't real. So maybe it goes down to 400. Not sure. Now after you do a few other steps you're left with 10-15 tickers. My question is how do you manage to go from 450 tickers down to 10-15. This would be a week-long project for myself.

**""The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs (including stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity""**

In the same period (CMIIW), the company fire 800 employee.

you can check the detail here:
https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions
but I quote here
**The disparity between bottom-line executive compensation and what the 800 people laid off were making is staggering. Bobby Kotick has become the villain in this story. Kotick drew a $1.75 million salary plus another $26 million or so in stock and other equity awards in 2017. Dennis Durkin, who recently returned to the CFO role and was also put in charge of “emerging business” (figuring out where the company will make its money in the coming years), was given a $3.75 million cash bonus and another $11.3 million in as-yet unearned, performance-based equity**

Maybe this policy makes people judge The CEO, Bobby Kotick is a profit-oriented person - but honestly, which CEO doesn't?

* Destiny exclusivity for Playstation: Wrong strategy? But Bungie Games has divorced with Activision.
* Forcing microtransactions: Do it really bad? Even when the gamer doesn't like it, they keep playing the franchise.

Note:
I'm not a gamer, I play Deck Heroes, Mythgard, other TCG or CCG (unfortunately I don't play Hearthstone), FIFA (a long time ago). Thus I don't have expertise in the genre that Activision published.

Any comment would be very appreciated.

_______________________
Revision I

I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...

Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

You present several statements that raise certain questions.  For example:

1.	""Its PE ratio is similar to EA.""  It's trading at 15x book value... Why should I invest in EA or Activision if I can find a dozen or so companies that are trading at a significant discount?  You invoke the Graham/Buffett concept ""margin of safety"" but DCF analysis puts  its fair value between $71 and $78 per share.  That's the opposite of margin of safety.
2.	""has no intangible assets"" ... No? What's the $1.8 billion in accumulated intangible amortization?  You can't amortize assets you don't have.
3.	""Strong balance sheet""... what was the $18 million unrealized loss in Q3 of 2020 due to?
4.	How about the $6.8 billion in Goodwill?  That's an intangible asset.  What acquisitions are related to this and if they're still carrying this value, why would it be better for them to spend the $8 billion on more acquisitions than stock repurchases given that:
5.	"" but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance.""  Is it?  I see $11 billion in APIC.  Again: In these economically uncertain times, why would more acquisitions be better than share repurchases?
6.	""Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.""  What's the $194 million write down of AR in Q4 2020?  There's a quarterly carrying value around $83 million as a provision for doubtful accounts.  What's the connection between these two items and why could its resurgence to 2017 levels present a material impairment to their business, particularly under current economic conditions?

What concerns me is that you approach the analysis from the Graham angle of value and margin of safety, yet present no discussion of the indicators of the same.  The underpinnings of due diligence are in the data, which aren't presented or discussed in your analysis.  It's not that the above questions all have displeasing answers, but rather that these are the kind of questions you should be anticipating and addressing in your due diligence.

Due diligence is not an attempt to pitch me the prettiest profile of the company.   It's got to be a kicking of the tires, asking the tough questions, and seeing whether your hypothesis holds up to serious scrutiny.... and these are just questions I, as a relatively average FP&A guy, came up with glancing at the financials for five minutes, and it's not because I have a particular view of the company, but that is precisely the point.  Your analysis needs to be thorough and objective.",['EA']

mfkoyj,,investing,post,1617005626,"BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial ResultsUp until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

mfbyli,,investing,post,1616971610,"Investing in Helium - DMEHF DD **Investing in Desert Mountain Energy (DME.V, DMEHF)**

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

mfdia0,,investing,post,1616976808,"Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice.",

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['DE', 'ICE', 'TSLA']"

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['ED', 'WAT', 'BAC', 'ES', 'SPGI', 'GS']"

memnob,gsiebsk,investing,comment,1616880104,"Note that this portfolio is designed for Canadians.  XIC in particular is Canadian stocks, so Americans might want to allocate that to the US (and probably a bit to international, since there's already a lot of US in the portfolio), and people from other countries may want to allocate the 30% to their home country/region.

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC
* 30% VUN
* 10% AVUV
* 16% XEF
* 8% XEC
* 6% AVDV

I'm really glad you posted this, because even ignoring the factor aspect, most forecasts suggest US equities are expensive right now and call for international to outperform over the next decade.

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments.","['GOOGL', 'SPGI']"

meu01j,gsomxj5,investing,comment,1617023727,"I have a portion of my active investment allocation in a tactical asset allocation strategy that uses expected excess returns of SP500 relative to 10 year treasuries to determine allocation. SP500 10YR expected total returns are forecast using a valuation model (not CAPE but similar enough) to predict price return plus current dividend yield. 10YR treasury expected returns are estimated as current yield. The historical error in forecast versus realized realized 10 year return is used to evaluate the probability that stocks will outperform treasuries. I use this probability directly as an allocation target. In other words, if stocks are predicted to have a 90% probability of outperforming treasuries I allocate 90% to stocks and 10% to treasuries. If the probability is 50%, I allocated 50/50. I use a 24 month moving average of the probability to smooth the allocation and slow down transition in allocation. This slows transition from equity to bonds and vice versa. 

In general, I find that active strategies that use a probabilistic transition in allocation are more robust and easier to live with than strategies that make an all in 0% to 100% switch in allocation. Valuations don't switch instantly so I don't see why you'd want a strategy to switch allocation instantly. You're ""optimized"" 2% threshold probably has closer to 50/50 probability of either stock or bond outperformance - it makes more sense to take a 50/50 allocation until the valuation becomes more extreme one way or the other.

As you say, historically it's rare for the 10 year forecast of stock return to be less than the forecast for bond return so this strategy tends to be heavily allocated to stocks.

This incredibly simple strategy has actually been one of the most consistent performing of strategies I follow over the past 2 years.",
mei0vc,,investing,post,1616865034,"Plugging In: The EV Transition Gains SpeedArticle from Bloomberg

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

mea4sx,gshjot9,investing,comment,1616869480,"I just bought my first shares! I would appreciate it if someone could listen to my reasoning and give me some feedback.

I decided to purchase a few shares from Avantium (AVTX). 

This company is a spinoff from Shell, and their goal is to develop efficient green industrial processes to transform raw carbohydrates from “waste” sources such as wood chips into useful chemical compounds. This is a local company and I visited one of their buildings about two years ago during a university trip, and I saw that their building is modern and well-equipped. Some research groups from my university work with them and I am aware of the work that they are doing. So I have some level of understanding of the technologies that they are developing, and I can see first-hand that the investment that they put into R&D is not being wasted. 

Their current market cap is 138 million euros.  I think that this makes it a very cheap stock, and I expect to see considerable growth. My reasoning is the following:

The company is planning to build the first commercial FDCA plant. FDCA is a sugar-derived compound that can be polimerized into a bioplastic, most notable PEF, which is a leading candidate to replace PET plastics. The industrial process relies mainly on green cyclic catalytic processes. European legislation against standard plastics and in favor of green chemical processes will incentivize companies to use FDCA in the coming years.

At the moment the construction of the FDCA is still uncertain, as they have conditionally secured only 95 of the 150 million euros of funding that they need. This represents a risk, and I think that this is part of what is keeping the share value so low. I think that it is very likely that the company will secure the funding later this year, and this should cause the stock price to increase due to the lowered risk.  
I have tried to get an idea of how much this company could be worth in a few years. I think that AkzoNobel is a nice reference, as it is dutch company that develops paints and coatings and was founded in 1994. Its market cap is 18 billion euros. I also looked at companies that produce PET, and chose Eastman Chemical Company as a reference - its market cap is 15 billion.   
I think that I am not being too optimistic when I say that the market cap of Avantium could be above 2 billion euros 10 years from now. Since the current cap is 138 million, this means that on average an investment on this company would result in an average return on investment of 40% over the next 10 years.   
Putting it in these terms and looking at that 40% yearly ROI figure makes me think that I may be being far too optimistic about the growth of the company. What should I do to come up with more reasonable predictions? Am I thinking too far ahead?   
If you read this far, thanks a lot! Any feedback would be very welcome.",['EMN']

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

mefd3f,,investing,post,1616857044,"DD on digital health company OptimizeRx (OPRX) 

A  company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the  following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its  business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another  industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the  future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx  operates as a digital health company that provides communications  solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

I like this, I think it's a really good idea; and dealing directly with sales staff means they will pay. Companies don't always pay for quality, but they do pay for sales.

Whats their addressable market? say it takes off & becomes a staple; how much will insurance companies pay them?

My concern is Insurance companies are shitty, shitty business partners to have; when you do business with a monopoly expect to get fleeced. How hard would it be for Insurance companies to replace them with their own software development teams; realistically how much can OPRX charge before they do so?

Also, I thought management's discussion about opportunities in EHR was pretty compelling:

""Like no other digital health platform in the market, we deliver important information in real time at the point-of-care right when clinical decisions are being made. We have access to 10s of millions of patients and most physicians, as well as the technology compliance operational support to continue to play a major role in the ever evolving digital health market.

Our partnerships with EHR and e-prescribing companies enable us to augment that physician workflow with actionable insights by providing additional real time critical information to clinicians who are dealing everyday with complex healthcare scenarios. We can improve the patient and physician experience and ultimately treatment outcomes.""

me5yvd,,investing,post,1616816797,"Canadian Index ETFs XIU - XIC - VCN - ZCN comparison 

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

Beta

 Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index – **XIU**                             0.91 

 Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp – **XIC**           0.98

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

So my dad bought shares of Indusind international holdings (the holding company of Indusbank) in the 90s for 1 USD per share and they are based in the Mauritius. The company is offering to buyback the shares for 5 USD per share. 

From what I understand the company isn’t publicly listed so I would have to find a buyer myself but according to [this](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/indusind-bank-s-promoter-plans-to-get-listed-overseas-11613609396633.html) article they plan to become listed overseas by the 1st week of September. Does it mean it would be on a publicly listed stock exchange such as the NYSE? I think the market value of each share is a lot higher than the 5USD per share that the company is offering to buy back for, so would it make sense to wait for them to become publicly listed?

Netflix $24.98/20.34

I’m sure there are other good ones to compare in the sector. I had some down at $13.50 from pandemic low’s and I did pick up more at $50. The book value is good.

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['WFC', 'SPGI', 'BLK']"

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.

But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic’s scarring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March. Data for the prior week was revised to show 11,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 730,000 applications for the latest week.",

Is there a real reason that so many younger people with this huge purchase looming are investing/risking so much? 

I found myself coming to the realization during this downturn that it is quite important for those of us that are younger or in a house buying situation to only invest a smaller amount that wouldn't be devastating to lose, so I ended up trimming down a large percentage of my portfolio to sit on the sidelines. I.E I had up to 50% of my cash worth in my investing account, and trimmed that to about 25%

Some place several hundred trades a day emulating high frequency trading with min amount of experience. A few do well; majority treat the market like a slot machine.

One NYC high school teacher was shocked to find out all his students in the ghetto like neighborhood trading stocks underage (min 18).  What is their favorite play?  Short puts on GME!

Today there is one brand new investor having $50 on hand wanting to diversify his portfolio into 20 stocks. Look for suggestions. If you go to r/pennystocks most use their government checks, aid from $1400 to get them to the next level of success or lack of success.",
mkqfqa,,StockMarket,post,1617644826,"Meaning of ""38 - Redemption, retraction, cancellation, repurchase""?Hi,

I am researching the recent insiders' trading of a Canadian company listed on TSX using the Canadian Insider website. Not being a finance/accounting person, I do not understand some of the terminology used and how to interpret some of the figures presented.

So for the stock I am looking at, there are the following entries for the director of the company recently:

So has the director of the company recently bought 15792 shares and sold 38703 and 121334 shares (which seems to be a negative sign for the stock)?

Could anyone explain to me the meaning of ""Exercise of third party derivative"" and ""Redemption, retraction, cancellation, repurchase"" in this context?

Thank you very much.",

For this vote to take place, shareholders must vote for a reverse stock split as well as the change in control and issuance of new shares. 

Should these votes be positive, the two companies will merge, creating Palisade Bio. In the case of a merger, Seneca shareholders will own about 26% of Palisade Bio and enjoy a contingent value right, or CVR, giving shareholders rights to 80% of proceeds from Seneca Biopharma’s legacy assets. 

In the video, the CEO explained that the merger would be beneficial to Seneca shareholders, who are frustrated with historical stock performance. He went on to explain that through the merger, Seneca shareholders will enjoy ownership in a company with a world-class management team, several valuable ts, and a focus on providing shareholder value. 

Leading BioSciences has a strong pipeline of gastrointestinal drugs and a management team that has a strong history of performance. Moreover, not only will Seneca shareholders receive access to this management team and pipeline, should the merger be approved, shareholders will also enjoy an 80% share in legacy assets, So, you’re really not giving up much here.",['BIO']

If the reverse split happens so that the stock value is now at $10, how would this affect the option? Will the option always be corrected for this?

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares.

 Do I have an extra month to pay my taxes?

Yes. The May 17 deadline is for both payments and filing returns.

###### Who does the delay apply to?

The delay applies to individuals filing Forms 1040 and 1040-SR. It doesn’t affect deadlines for corporate, partnership or nonprofit tax returns.

###### What about first-quarter estimated tax payments?

The postponement doesn’t apply to first-quarter estimated tax payments for 2021. The deadline for them remains April 15. On March 29, the IRS reaffirmed the April 15 deadline.

###### Do I need to take any action for the delay to apply to me?

No. The extension is automatic for individual taxpayers. The agency says there is no need to call the IRS or file a form to qualify for this extension.

###### Does the May 17 deadline apply to contributions for 2020 traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and HSAs?

Yes, it does. This issue had been unclear, but on March 29 the IRS issued Notice 2021-21, which postpones to May 17 the April 15 deadline for 2020 contributions to these accounts.

 What about state tax deadlines?

“We expect most states to conform their deadlines with the new federal deadlines,” says Mary Peterson, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, a state-tax group.

[As I mentioned 2 days ago](https://www.chatanalytic.com/post/daily-analysis), ASO got a lot of attention when it beat its earnings. People are excited today because they expect there might be a squeeze for this heavily shorted stock.

Guess what? People are getting more interested in discussing ASO because it beats the earning, has tons of cash, and is heavily shorted.

Good morning Traders, Markets reopen to new levels and volatility shows the trouble can has been kicked down the road for now ... I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things...[Premarket outlook for trading the Spy for consistent profits 4 5 21](https://youtu.be/RtQpFWSZScI) 

📷

Markets reopen to new levels and volatility shows the trouble can has been kicked down the road for now. With futures being open on Friday but equities being close how will things shake out in the new week. The first thing that caught my attention was the volatility can has been kicked down the rd. The Volatility curve seems to have normalized with fear now put off to June and beyond. With this being the beginning of the month, I usually look for continuation to the upside in the form of a lopsided range day type structure on the second trading day of the month. So, with the actual equites open for business today and futures already having jumped on Friday I look for a little equalization in the form of consolidation before decision to continue higher. Let's get into today's outcomes: 1) we hold support at 401area, which opens a path to 405 after a little consolidation between 401 and 403 area. 2) We have a trend day up type day. We try to fill the gap by retesting but not making all the way back too 400, then a straight up toward 405 area. 3) we break below 401, opening a path to 398. Look to short retest pushes back toward 400. 

1) we hold support at 401area, which opens a path to 405 after a little consolidation between 401 and 403 area. **40% probability** 

2) We have a trend day up type day. We try to fill the gap by retesting but not making all the way back too 400, then a straight up toward 405 area. **35% probability** 

3) we break below 401, opening a path to 398. Look to short retest pushes back toward 400. **25% probability**",['GPS']

mka3zb,,StockMarket,post,1617587787,"Long term gains SaleHello, 

I'm trying to sell my Delta shares in order to fund my new investment, Delta was a huge win for me, buying in last year however now I have a different stock in mind that I think will perform better than Delta from current position, not that anyone asked but it's Icahn Enterprises, however I want to make sure that every stock I sell will fall under long term gains for me.

So I have been buying Delta since March 2020, By April 4th, 2020, I've had 25 shares, so it has been a year since I have held them. I kept on buying until September 2020, 450 shares total, except for one occasion where I sold 40 shares on May 18th. 

So to keep long story short, if I were to sell let's say 25 Delta shares tomorrow, will they be taxed as long term gains for me since by this point last year I already had 25 shares, or would the fact that I sold 40 shares in May 2020 would have already sold those oldest owned shares I've had, and I'd have to wait for the next date when I've had more that 40 shares last year?

 I am using Robinhood by the way if this differs between brokers.

&#x200B;

This was in back of my mind for a while now, since I knew soon would be a year since many of my purchases occurred, so would be grateful for the insight.

Thank You!",
mka3zb,gterfpq,StockMarket,comment,1617588040,I dont have experience with Robinhood but most brokers have a way to specify tax lot sales such as first in first out or last in last out or specific share lot.

mka3zb,gterr3q,StockMarket,comment,1617588223,"You need to wait one year and a day for long term capital gain.  If you don’t tell a broker , it usually is first in first out , but you can specify lots . And each lots is treated differently obviously",

mka3zb,gtesj7x,StockMarket,comment,1617588675,"So as I understand because of Robinhood's first in first out policy, they sold my 25 shares that would be over 366 days already in my first sale, now I have to wait until 366 days have passed since I've held more that 40 shares in my account last year.

Honestly this seems like a pretty big issue that should really be tracked on the app, showing short term vs long term shares, in my case I'll be taxed at 22% instead of 15% because of a few days. 

But good information to know, thank you all for the replies!",
mka3zb,gtflaeu,StockMarket,comment,1617610447,"Robinhood is first in and first out, so according to info you provided, you bought 25 shares in 3/2020 and you kept buying until 9/2020 totaling into 450 shares. 
- so you sold 40 shares in 5/2020, so you just have to backtrack and go look at your history. So those 40 shares would have been the first 40 in your lot that got sold. 
- so your original 25 are sold based on what you are saying. 
- to keep it simple, just wait until 9/2020 to avoid any confusion. Or you can take a look at purchase history and no. Of  share that you bought totals more than 40 by today then they ate long term for you.",

mjvowl,,StockMarket,post,1617540764,"How to pick stocks for swing trading?I am wanting to swing trade, possibly day trade once I’ve done more research. I dabbled with Robinhood last year and made $200ish (mostly on Moderna). I’ve watched several swing trade strategy videos and done some reading, and am slowly figuring out a strategy for myself. I have a decent understanding of technical analysis, but I need help actually picking stocks to analyze. So far I am using a screener (on tradingview) and am looking at low P/E ratios, dividends, debt and low/highs (1 month and 1 year). I then pick out stocks that have a pretty big gap between their lowest and highest prices, and examine their chart and do some google searches to see if there is any relevant news.

I actually look for companies that are buying shares back regularly bc it just helps to have another person on your side.

How DeFi Is Being Used Now

DeFI is making its way into a wide variety of simple and complex financial transactions. It’s powered by decentralized apps called “dapps,” or other programs called “protocols.” Dapps and protocols handle transactions in the two main cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).
While Bitcoin is the more popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum is much more adaptable to a wider variety of uses, meaning much of the dapp and protocol landscape uses Ethereum-based code.
Here are some of the ways dapps and protocols are already being used:

Traditional financial transactions. Anything from payments, trading securities and insurance, to lending and borrowing are already happening with DeFi.

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Right now, most cryptocurrency investors use centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini. DEXs facilitate peer-to-peer financial transactions and let users retain control over their money.

E-wallets. DeFi developers are creating digital wallets that can operate independently of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges and give investors access to everything from cryptocurrency to blockchain-based games.

Stable coins. While cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, stable coins attempt to stabilize their values by tying them to non-cryptocurrencies, like the U.S. dollar.

Yield harvesting. Dubbed the “rocket fuel” of crypto, DeFi makes it possible for speculative investors to lend crypto and potentially reap big rewards when the proprietary coins DeFi borrowing platforms pay them for agreeing to the loan appreciate rapidly.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs create digital assets out of typically non-tradable assets, like videos of slam dunks or the first tweet on Twitter. NFTs commodify the previously uncommodifiable.

Flash loans. These are cryptocurrency loans that borrow and repay funds in the same transaction. Sound counterintuitive? Here’s how it works: Borrowers have the potential to make money by entering into a contract encoded on the Ethereum blockchain—no lawyers needed—that borrows funds, executes a transaction and repays the loan instantly. If the transaction can’t be executed, or it’ll be at a loss, the funds automatically go back to the loaner. If you do make a profit, you can pocket it, minus any interest charges or fees. Think of flash loans as decentralized arbitrage.

The DeFi market gauges adoption by measuring what’s called locked value, which calculates how much money is currently working in different DeFi protocols. At present, the total locked value in DeFi protocols is nearly $43 billion.
Adoption of DeFi is powered by the omnipresent nature of blockchain: The same moment a dapp is encoded on the blockchain, it’s globally available. While most centralized financial instruments and technologies roll out slowly over time, governed by the respective rules and regulations of regional economies, dapps exist outside of these rules, increasing their potential reward—and also increasing their risks.

Risks and Downsides of DeFi

DeFi is an emerging phenomenon that comes with many risks. As a recent innovation, decentralized finance has not been stress tested by long or widespread use. In addition, national authorities are taking a harder look at the systems it’s putting in place, with an eye toward regulation. Some of the other risks of DeFi include:

No consumer protections. DeFi has thrived in the absence of rules and regulations. But this also means users may have little recourse should a transaction go foul. In centralized finance, for instance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) reimburses deposit account holders up to $250,000 per account, per institution if a bank fails. Moreover, banks are required by law to hold a certain amount of their capital as reserves, to maintain stability and cash you out of your account any time you need. No similar protections exist in DeFi.

Hackers are a threat. While a blockchain may be nearly impossible to alter, other aspects of DeFi are at large risk of being hacked, which can lead to funds theft or loss. All of decentralized finance’s potential use cases rely on software systems that are vulnerable to hackers.

Collateralization. Collateral is a thing of value used to secure a loan. When you get a mortgage, for instance, the loan is collateralized by the home you’re buying. Nearly all DeFi lending transactions require collateral equal to at least 100% of the value of the loan, if not more. These requirements vastly restrict who is eligible for many types of DeFi loans.

Private key requirements. With DeFi and cryptocurrency, you must secure the wallets used to store your cryptocurrency assets. Wallets are secured with private keys, which are long, unique codes known only to the owner of the wallet. If you lose a private key, you lose access to your funds—there is no way to recover a lost private key.

How to Get Involved with DeFi

If you’d like to learn more about DeFi in a hands-on way, here are a few ways to get started:

Get a Crypto Wallet

“Start by setting up an Ethereum wallet like Metamask, then funding it with Ethereum,” says Cosman. “Self-custody wallets are your ticket to the world of DeFi, but make sure to save your public and private key. Lose these, and you won’t be able to get back into your wallet.”

Trade Digital Assets.

“I recommend trading a small amount of two assets on a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap,” says Doug Schwenk, chairman of Digital Asset Research. “Trying this exercise will help a crypto enthusiast understand the current landscape, but be prepared to lose everything while you’re learning which assets and platforms are best and how to manage risks.”

Look into Stablecoins

“An exciting way to try out DeFi without exposing oneself to the price swings of an underlying asset is to try out TrueFi, which offers competitive returns on stablecoins (AKA dollar-backed tokens, which aren’t subject to price movements),” Cosman says.
The key to any foray into a new financial space is to start slow, stay humble and don’t get ahead of yourself. Keep in mind that digital assets traded in the cryptocurrency and DeFi worlds are fast-moving and there’s significant potential for loss.

The Future of DeFi

From taking out the middleman to turning basketball clips into digital assets with monetary value, DeFi’s future looks bright. That’s why people like Dan Simerman, head of financial relations at IOTA Foundation, a DeFi research and development group, see both the promise and potential of DeFi as far-reaching, even though it’s still in the infancy of its capabilities.
Investors will soon have more independence, which will allow them to “deploy [assets] in creative ways that seem impossible today,” Simerman says. DeFi also carries big implications for the big data sector as it matures to enable new ways to commodify data, Simerman says.

But for all its promise, DeFi has a long road ahead, especially when it comes to uptake by the general public.
“The promise is there,” says Simerman. “It’s up to us to continue educating people about the potential, but we also need to keep working hard to build the tools that will allow people to see it for themselves.”

I watched the stocks they were talking about for several days and one of them started gaining like crazy all of a sudden.  I downloaded a trading app and bought a meager $150 worth of that stock.  SNDL (a cannabis company if anyone doesn't know of it).  I bought it at $3.95..lol. 

It crashed right back down to about 2/3 of that the next day and to about half of that the day after (something like that).  Since then I've been trying to buy shares at the lowest price I can to bring down my average cost.  My current position is 550 shares at ave. $1.29

I recently read a post by someone in a similar position.  He recommended selling calls at $1.50 to make some money back.  I have several questions.  Would it be better to try to sell at a higher price?  ($1.75 for example)?  Would this be a wise move at all selling calls?

mjo72o,,StockMarket,post,1617507470,"ET DD I did today for a discord I’m in.   This is a DD I wrote for my friends and I discord, thought I’d share.

       Energy Transfer LP, ticker symbol ET, is an Energy Sector Master Limited Partnership, or MLP comprised of 13 companies currently, ET itself and 12 acquisitions it’s made over the years . A MLP is simply a publicly traded partnership. What this means is that instead of buying a share of the company and being just a voting shareholder, you pay to become a corporate partner and instead of dividends you are paid out in distributions which are basically the same thing with one difference, MLP are closer to REIT’s and BDC’s than individual stocks, and like those two assets that’s have to pass 90% of profits not used in upkeep of the business to shareholders, MLP’s have to pass on 100% of profits not reinvested into the business. Final note on MLP’s is that their distributions are taxed like REIT’s and BDC’s so if you have a tax advantaged account I would put ET there rather than a normal brokerage but it’s absolutely fine to have in a normal brokerage if that’s all you have. 

        ET currently operates in the business of transporting oil, gas, natural gas, and liquid natural gas (LNG) from its source to energy companies that turn it into electricity or refine it or whatever. ET itself is only concerned about the transport or energy, almost like it’s in the name or something. As a result ET has been able to expand its business so much that it is responsible for the transport of 1/4 of all US produced natural gas and LNG, as well as 35% of all US produced crude oil. If you live in the southern US, your power ran though their pipes at some point. In addition to their energy transportation lines, which account for roughly 88% of revenue, ET owns a controlling stake in both Sunoco (34% of common stock shares owned by ET; which it uses to sell their gasoline directly to consumers through their gas stations throughout the US) and USA compression Partners LP (ET owns 48% of common stock shares). Their ownership/partnership of USA Compression Partners  (USAC), which services/repairs oil and natural gas lines as well as updates them with modern tech and pipes (and is regarded as one of the top in the nation) , is why I’m especially bullish on ET as it allows them to exploit a loophole when it comes to making new pipelines that I will explain further into this discussion. Due to ET owning 48% of USAC, that means for every $1 that ET spends on USAC to fix their equipment, ET gets back $0.48. It’s for this reason that USAC accounts for approximately 6% of yearly revenue and since being acquired, has been a break even or positive investment for ET every single year. Sunoco also contributes approximately 6% of ET’s yearly revenue and that is expected to increase as gas prices go up under a Dem controlled senate, house, and WH. 

      ET is also in the process of making two new acquisitions this year, and specifically, this quarter. First up is the completion and opening of their largest green/renewable energy project yet. A massive solar farm in west Texas that is expected to generate 28 MW at peak output (keep in mind 1 MW is enough to power 400-900 homes for a year). This farm was made with a partnership with Recurrent energy.  The second expected acquisition is Enable Midstream Partners, a large competitor in the gulf coast area. 

     Now for the more negative side of ET because I have to address the massive winter storm we just had and how it’s expected to effect ET. In short, if nothing changed at all this year after it was hit, ET would be looking at losing about 1/3 of yearly revenue according to their latest Earnings Report. However, according to their own management team in that same ER, if the solar farm in west Texas proceeds on schedule, opening in Q2 of this year, and if their scheduled acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners LLP, which happens to be Louisiana’s largest pipeline company and a large competitor in the gulf coast area, goes through as expected also in Q2 (the buy out is expected to be finalized between May 19th and July 1st) then the total fallout of the winter storm, including damages, lawsuits, and cost of modernization/upgrades is dramatically reduced to being only 1/4 of yearly *PROFITS* instead of pure revenue. This essentially makes it almost a non-existent problem when you look at it from the perspective of at least a year. And the best part is that since they said that in their ER, the stock price has already moved accordingly so now it’s basically on discount because people drove it down based on the short term news and not realizing that by the start of Q3, the damages will most likely already be paid off, allowing this stock to really take off. 

     Finally, before I get into some of the basically financial fundamentals of ET and tell y’all where I think it’s going, I want to go over what I think are some of the more common concerns one might have about ET. These aren’t mine personally as you’ll soon see but they are some of the most common concerns of people on message boards and some analyses as well.  

     The first problem I commonly see is that, due to Dems being in control, prices of oil and other natural gases will rise increasing the cost to produce them. While this is true, ET itself does not dig up or produce any gas or oil on its own, it is purely a midstream (or transportation and storage) energy company. This means that rather than buying the builder of the bridge, you are buying the company that tax’s people to use it.  As a result, rising prices in my opinion are actually a good thing for ET, since they don’t charge a flat rate to transport materials, rather a % of the cost of the materials. So as the cost of oil goes up, so to does ET’s transport prices. 

      The second common concern I see relates to the first one in that it’s also a result of Dems being in control. Typically under Dem administrations and congresses, new pipeline construction is pretty much put on a standstill cause they want to focus more on renewables and beefing up our green energy grid (something ET is also doing as previously discussed, they are close to 25% of all energy used being renewable). This means ET can’t build new pipelines and their growth plans are ruined right? Well not so fast because I still have to explain to you the biggest reason I’m buying ET, and that is their partnership/ownership of USAC. This simple company lets them exploit a loophole that none of the other pipeline companies are large enough to do. Instead of simply building new lines, they are able to buyout competitors that are older/need repairs at a discount, hire USAC to come in and replace all the pipes with brand new ones with the best technology, and since they are now owned by ET, those pipes have to be allowed to connect to ET’s main supply line, so it doesn’t have to worry about Dems blocking new pipelines since legally, it’s an old pipeline being refurbished and outfitted to connect to the main supply. I’m not sure how the connector isn’t counted as a new pipeline but I’ll just chalk that up to lobbying.  And since they own 48% of USAC, they get back 48% of their payment, reducing costs. So while their competitors are unable to go to new mines as they are discovered, ET is able to just buy the local infrastructure that’s moving the product from the source, fully upgrade it, and simply attach it to its network. It’s because of this strategy that they have a network of lines that goes from New York, to Montana, down to Texas, Arizona, and Florida. They also just purchased a line in the northwest so expect that to be connected through the Montana pipeline in the near future. 

      The final concern I see is their debt is huge. And while it is large, you have to remember it’s technically 13 (soon to be 14) companies all rolled into one. So it’s debt will seem a bit large for a single pipeline company, until you realize it’s 13 companies. Additionally as you’ll read in the financial fundamentals, they have a fairly average Debt/Equity ratio of only 2.83 and it’s competitors of similar size have D/E ratios in the range of 5-35.  The final point I’ll make on ET’s debt is that the vast majority is long term debt which it acquired from its buying of companies. They have also made it a point that after the Enable Midstream acquisition, they intend to begin paying off their debt in droves so that they can look towards another round of aggressive acquisitions like it recently underwent which added the debt in the first place. All in all, I’m not concerned about the debt in general as I believe they are more than capable of handling it.

   Now finally the financial and fundamental break down of ET; its current price is $7.85 has a dividend yield of 7.99% which translates to roughly $0.61 per share paid out over 4 quarters with payments in Feb, May, Aug, and Nov. it’s currently paying out 84% of its yearly profits as dividends and it has a safe rating for its dividend payments. Analysis have a 1 year target price range for ET between $7.50 and $16 with an average price target of $10.84 suggesting room for solid price appreciation. It’s D/E ratio is 2.82 and while this is above the 2.0 ratio that companies strive for, it’s still extremely manageable. 

   Over all I am going to be adding ET to my Roth IRA. It has a strong dividend that is relatively safe, is still expanding its business and is able to do so better than its competitors and it is updating with modern times to better incorporate renewable and green energy into its services. I am going to be buying ET until it tops $8.75 personally and going to just let it DRIP. I personally see it hitting a high of $12-$14 in the current Biden admin and potentially $16 should he or another Dem win in 2024. 
  
    I’m not a financial advisor, just a dude using Google who likes listening to earnings reports and can recognize when a stock is beaten down a bit too much because of current news but is likely to recover and even exceed where it was at previously.

Buffett made a famous bet that hedge funds would underperform the market over a 10-year stretch, which he won, but he's also famous for overperforming the index (on average) for decades. The standard argument is that if you take the S&P500, remove the companies that you think are worst (poor management, obsolete business model, etc.), and if you're not charging yourself fees, you could stand a decent chance of beating the market.

mj4okl,,StockMarket,post,1617439405,"Deliveroo IPO, was it that bad?All the media headlines signalled last week Deliveroo IPO was a crash. But well, I wish every startup is so ""unsuccessful"", the company is now worth $7.5 billion. There's no point in writing about Deliveroo's business model, food delivery is food delivery, instead I'll share the most curious details from their IPO prospectus.

&#x200B;

1. The founder's stake after all rounds is 6.1%. The company has 6 investors with more shares, the largest being Amazon with 15.8%. At the same time the founder retains control in decision making, his shares weigh 20 times more than ordinary shares, he has 57.5% of votes. After the IPO the shares of the old investors decrease - which is perfectly logical, but the founder's even slightly increased. He got new shares, apparently some incentive clause in the old shareholder agreement worked.
2. Deliveroo's P&L is excellent by startup standards: revenue is growing faster than losses, and in the covid year the losses dropped altogether. Bottom line for 2020: revenue $1.6 billion (+54%), loss $310 million (-29%). What's more, if you tweak it a bit and throw out some ""atypical and unexpected to recur expenses"", there is almost no loss at all, a measly 12 million in 2020. Half the business is in the UK and Ireland, the other half in 10 other countries.

I am looking for more of the lesser known ones, as i already dabble with many of the top subscribed ones. It could be someone who dives into individual stocks or has a portfolio that they like to discuss. Joseph Carlson is one that i like. He talks about the importance of dividend investing and why it can actually be more effective than returns on just the S&P. Plain Bagel is another youtuber that is great who educates on the fundamentals of investing and the different quirks and features. So yeah just want to hear all of you're opinions on this topic.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.

# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.
*****
> The U.S. Labor Department’s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.
*****
> The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute’s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> “Literally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We’re coming off a low base,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks — unless interest rates rise too quickly.
*****
> Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.
*****
> On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.
*****
> The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.
*****
> The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.
*****
> # All eyes on earnings
> “The macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That will be the next thing to turn to.”
*****
> He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.
*****
> First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.
*****
> Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.
*****
> “Approximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,” noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
> Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.
*****
> “In each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.
*****
> “Our work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2½–3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,” Golub wrote.
*****
> # April is far from cruelest month
Aside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.
*****
> Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that’s constructive for stocks.
*****
> The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&P 500, trading on the CBOE.
*****
> Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.
*****
> Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.
*****
> “The bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.
*****
> “April is usually good. It’s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It’s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.
*****
> The market enters the “sell in May” period during the second quarter. The market adage, “sell in May and go away,” is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.
*****
> “In that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,” Stovall said. “Tech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
> The producer price index — which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output — will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.
*****
> As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
> Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.
*****
> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.

> # Stocks Love April

> “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Mark Twain

> What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Just how strong has April been lately? “I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Other than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:

> * Since 1950 it is the second best month
> * The past 20 years it is the best month
> * The past 10 years it is the second best month
> * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking it a step further, here’s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.

> # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After

> Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**

> # A Humble Victory Lap

> It has been a little over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It’s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.

> It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie—a lesson we always keep in mind.

> “Few on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‘what have you done for me lately’ industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.”

> Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.

*****

> # Turn Off, Tune Out

> The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.

> Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.

> Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**

> In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**

> At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.

> # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.

> As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**

> That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**

> As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.

> # Stocks and Inflation

> As we continue LPL Research’s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow’s blog, where we’ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.

> Looking at S&P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “You can’t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that’s under control is a tailwind for stocks,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.”

> Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> The inflation question is one that isn’t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn’t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.

So i made some research about it, and i think i will bought their stock but also need your opinion about it, im new in this so every help will be huge.

Pfizer Inc. discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. It offers medicines and vaccines in various therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular metabolic and pain under the Eliquis, Chantix/Champix, and Premarin family brands; biologics, small molecules, immunotherapies, and biosimilars under the Ibrance, Xtandi, Sutent, Inlyta, Retacrit, Lorbrena, and Braftovi brands; and sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines under the Sulperazon, Medrol, Zithromax, Vfend, and Panzyga brands. More about them [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/profile?p=PFE). 

Little about their finance: 

Market Cap **202.487B** 

Forward Dividend & Yield :**1.56 (4.30%)** 

In last 12 months they have total revenue of **41,908** and cost of revenue **8,574** so its **GROSS PROFIT** of  **33,334**

In February 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech dosed the first participant in a global Phase 2/3 study to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women 18 years of age and older. 

In March 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech dosed the first healthy children in a global Phase 1/2/3 continuous study to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 11 years to 6 month old. 

&#x200B;

* *Analysis of 927 confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19 demonstrates BNT162b2 is highly effective with 91.3% vaccine efficacy observed against COVID-19, measured seven days through up to six months after the second dose*
* *Vaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 95.3% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration*
* *Vaccine was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 cases in South Africa, where the B.1.351 lineage is prevalent*
* *Vaccine safety now evaluated in more than 44,000 participants 16 years of age and older, with more than 12,000 vaccinated participants having at least six months follow-up after their second dose*
* *The companies plan to share these results with worldwide regulatory agencies soon*

mjv8yp,gtd64sv,StockMarket,comment,1617557172,"OP DD is lacking, but the vaccine *may* be bigger than people expect (currently common sentiment is it’s worth nothing and can’t move the stock, as can be seen by other comments on this thread). In early February, projected 2020 revenues from the vaccine were $15B, with 20-30% margins and half of profits shared w Biontec. ~$2B is over 20% of their 2020 income. Since that projection, 500M+ orders came in, so at minimum revenues will be $20B. If a booster is required, it will be their most profitable treatment (currently pneumovax).

The viatris spinoff may seem like a negative at face value, but most would view it as a positive (after all, this is why Pfizer chose to spin them off). Viatris only holds off patent drugs, and was decreasing profits every year. Having shed the slowly dying Viatris, the expectation is for Pfizer to grow. W 80+ drugs in pipeline, 30+ phase 3 or just past phase 3, and covax goodwill likely improving their ability to raise drug prices, I like the odds.","['VTRS', 'PFE']"

The Company has begun the process of becoming current in its reporting obligations with the OTC Markets, beginning with financials, completing a successful audit, and updating new director biographies accordingly.

The Acquisition Agreement between the two companies allows CeCors to purchase all outstanding shares of PsyKey Inc., a Canadian federal corporation. PsyKey Inc. will operate as a wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary of CeCors until the Company achieves current status with OTC Markets. At that point, they will look to a name change to PsyKey World. The Company has completed an Authorized Share increase of 250 million shares, for a total of 500 million Authorized Shares in order to accommodate for the acquisition. There are no outstanding convertible notes, and all shares issued in consideration for the purchase of PsyKey Inc. will be subject to standard regulatory restriction periods.",

mj2zvr,,StockMarket,post,1617431306,"Question on drawing s/r using different time periodsSo I am a swing trader and like to hold for a few days to a week but I had some questions in regards to drawing support and resistance lines using different time periods
-

So I absolutetly love using the weekly chart to draw my support and resistance levels

My question is in regards to the daily and intraday time frames, let say the weekly resistance is at $10 and the daily or intraday time period actually brakes this level and is now climbing up, would it be stupid to jump in since the week isn't over therefore the weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 therefore I shouldn't jump in.

Summary
-

Should I stick with one time period, so if I draw s/r using weekly, I shouldn't ever check other periods, my entry/exit should be strictly using weekly? 

OR is it okay to use weekly and daily together but not use intraday? So weekly resistance at $10, and daily closes above $10, while weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 yet, wouldn't be a good idea to jump in because by the time the weekly candle closes above $10 I would have missed out on the run

TLDR
-
 trade using same time period or can we make exception to use weekly and daily timeperiods together?",

That meeting with Florida's politicians the other day was a waste of time.  This CDC update just creates more barriers for the cruise industry to sail out of US ports.

From the above article:

 ""As it stands currently, the new guidelines that the CDC has issued do not speed up a return of cruising anytime soon. The cruise lines have no guidance on when they would start test cruises; there is no guidance on restart dates.

Although we knew that phase two would always only be some additional technical guidance from the CDC, what they have released now seems to be disappointing for everyone in the cruise industry.""

Plus, they're not whiny like the American cruise companies, so you don't have to listen to a year of false promises and crying while you wait for it to get back to pre-pandemic levels. Cruises have to visit lots of countries that are currently at like 2% vaccinated. That's not going to change until after all the smart people in the big countries get vaccinated, and the demand goes down. Then the small countries will be able to buy vaccine. So even with most of the US reopening in the summer, most cruises aren't going to be ready until next year.👼",

It's a bit more likely that the margin calls happen now since the SLR expired but still not likely at least for now unless the market trend turns.

miuni2,,StockMarket,post,1617400500,"Suggestion for New Traders and How They Should Start!I have just recently joined Reddit, and in my short time I have seen a lot of new investors asking questions about where to start. I’m sure this has been posted on this massive community before, but here is my input on WHERE a new trader should start and how.

First and foremost, focus on LEARNING Before focusing on making money.

1. Get yourself a demo trading account. 
This can be done with many big brokers. Will not name any here as a simple google search will answer this for you. 

2. Read the following books:
Books are a great way to stimulate your mind and get you thinking in the right direction. Most things online try to sell you some sort of program after. Books don’t tend to do that!

- Trading in the zone - Mark Douglas
- Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard - Mark Minervini
- A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis - Anna Coulling

3 Pick ONE trading strategy. TRADE ONLY THAT for 3 months in your Demo account!

A strategy can be any of the following:
Bullish pennant,
Falling wedge,
Breakout,
Double bottoms,
Cup n handle etc

4. Track your entries, exits, targets, and why and what happens.
Tracking everything you do will give you enough data points so you can make a decisions based on what and where you should focus your energy on! Use an excel sheet!

5. Keep tracking and trading until you are consecutively profitable for 3months straight.
You want to stay consistently profitable in ur demo trading account before you go live! 



This is going to be the best and least expensive way to get you started! 

Hope that helps!!

Noticed a discrepancy and did all the math by hand - the day's returns on 4/1/2020 chart was less than what it says I actually have ----

Put another way, the big ol chart you see for **today's total returns across all stocks**, says +$50 on the day.

But I did the math myself, adding/subtracting all of today's returns - and it came out to +$80

My friend did the same. He mathed his daily returns out himself to +$70, but RH says +$50.

**EXAMPLE**

**Stock A is up $1, Stock B is up $4, Stock C is up $5. Daily return at that time should say $10, but instead it says $7.**

I got sick of typing in same stuff for Aswath Damodaran's DCF sheets so I decided to automate a large part of it.

Here's an example I did for AAPL: [tracktak.com/stock/aapl-us/discounted-cash-flow](https://tracktak.com/stock/aapl-us/discounted-cash-flow?cagrYearOneToFive=0.2&ebitTargetMarginInYearTen=0.28&salesToCapitalRatio=3&yearOfConvergence=3)

mjdkzh,,StockMarket,post,1617472547,"I think this is worth checking outThese guys called out AYRO and CAN as swing trades this month, CAN already closed out at 17% gains AYRO up 6% already it’s insane. Last month they closed out 672% gains and it just keeps going. I’m gonna write a small post on what they do because I feel they deserve the publication 

Teaching: 
They teach you about shit. Day trading, swing trading, technical analysis, portfolio management. I was skeptical at first that this was a gimmick but these guys truly want to help you

Trading: these guys are the shit. 
They make day trade calls in their paid section all day long and they get it right 9 times out of 10. They have 6 analysts working for them to find these trades. They do swing trades almost daily and those are almost always right as well, and with their techniques when they are wrong you barely lose at all and when you win, you win pretty big. 

In my opinion:
They are pretty new, they got some growing to do but they are fuckin great and I’ll do my part in helping them by making some of these posts.. they love what they do and in just one month they grew from 
 100 people to 1000 and they deserve it for all their hard work.

miz83z,,StockMarket,post,1617416002,"Monday predictions Because of NFP reportI believe that the tech market will be down on Monday. The report was quite positive, smashing expectations for new jobs. There is other stuff. But I see value stocks back in play for Monday. Rotation out of tech for a day or two, and then back into tech for April. The fact that the report was positive sounds positive overall, but more jobs means more workers, and more people being out and about and spending on basic necessities that they needed. I can’t imagine this translating to more spending on tech stocks. I think there’s still value in some tech stocks, which is why I say April will be green overall, but I’m talking Monday open after Easter. Historically seems to be more favored to a down day also.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Well, I finally built a tool to do the same tracking and analysis for the US House of Representatives.

During the first couple of days, I was seeing you all on TV and it really made my days. I was so proud of this sub. Before leaving, I had set my limit orders and then didn't have any computer access until January 29th.

In the meantime, most of my limit orders hit. When I finally got computer access on the 29th for five mins, I sold the rest of my holding.

I've now been completely sober for over two months for the first time since my early teens. For a while I had wanted to do something special for my parents as they're getting older. With this GME money I was able to buy them a car, straight cash.

You should know, the rate of co-morbid substance and gambling addiction is incredibly high. “The next YOLO” definitely doesn’t sound like healthy and thoughtful investing. And while I know everyone shits on that here, your buying pattern on GME wasn’t a YOLO, it was a thoughtful strategy that you leveled into and sold thoughtfully. Don’t let the rush of a huge win make you into a gambling addict now that you don’t have the rush for drugs. **Think seriously about joining the theta gang** now that you’ve got the capital to do so, especially in this market condition.

Woke up to the news, did some due diligence, but this form of stock sale potential will allow GameStop, if they want, to slowly sell securities to raise money.  They won’t do it all at once, because it’s not in their interest to promote panic, (no panic or price drop is  the purpose of this type of offering, versus a bulk sale, new share issuance, etc)

Minus that minor morning heart attack I’m extremely bullish on the company and the squeeze.  Almost thought it was a major dilution or something dumb af based on the headlines.

Edit:  Here’s the prospectus from the SEC if you want to see, bullet point 2 shows that no sales were made on the last version of this.  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm#supprom160986_12

mkljmv,,wallstreetbets,post,1617631731,"AMD Increasing Production by 20% in Q2, buy before earnings!Remember that there is no chip shortage. It's a chip demand. AMD is making more chips than they ever have in their history but demand is even greater than that. For an explanation, see this on youtube /watch?v=3A4yk-P5ukY So when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su says that the chip shortage is a good thing for AMD, you can start to understand why. And also start to understand why AMD's stock can soar on earnings.

The news article on AMD increasing production in English is here:

[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-desktop-cpu-supply-availability-better-this-quarter-increased-supply/)

They're getting the information from Channel Gate, which is in Chinese. It says that AMD will increase chip supply by 20% in Q2 compared to Q1. Now, this is rumors so the market isn't making any moves based on it yet, but it's likely that this means AMD is increasing chip production by 20% in Q2 relative to Q1. This follows Dr. Lisa Su saying that they are working on ways of increasing production to meet demand in an interview with Cramer a few weeks ago. You can find that interview on youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc So the rumor is likely true here.

Because AMD is selling everything they make, the increase in production will translate directly into an increase in earnings. Therefor, I expect AMD to make the official announcement of the increase in production along side a revised earnings expectation for the year in the next earnings report. In this market, you can't just beat earnings, you have to increase earnings expectations going forward, and that's what I believe will happen with the increase in production.

Another, unrelated positive for the company is that, due to retailers jacking up prices on AMD products, AMD has started to sell more and more of their products directly from their own store, cutting out the middle man. [https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us](https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/us) They're doing this to ""ensure gamers can get AMD products at MSRP"" But really it means AMD is making an extra 20% off each chip. Brilliant.

I've been posting over the last month that I believe AMD is going to $120 and the jump will happen within the next 3 months. I still think this is true.

mkljmv,gtgggtm,wallstreetbets,comment,1617632945,"It is funny that AMD used to be this subreddit's darling yet very rarely we see anything AMD make front page. The bullish thesis on AMD is unbelievably strong. AMD is doing 50% revenue growth WITH chip shortages. Margins are growing rapidly and market share as well. AMD is entering new industries and new partnerships rapidly. Lisa SU has conservatively guided another 40% this year but with their usual beats this will be another 50%+ year, if chip shortages resolve could be 60-70%. Tesla AMD partnership has yet to be officially announced. It is likely waiting for the vote on AMD's Xlinix acquisition to be completed before they formally announce it.

AMD currently has P/E of 40 ..... for a company jumping 50% revenue a year. The stock price is heavily weighed down this past 6 months from Xlinix acquisition (which is done through stock sale giving XLNX holders a fixed AMD stock amount). Once Xlinix acquisition is completed and chip shortages are resolved, this rocket ship will take off and likely stock will jump 50% in a matter of months.","['TSLA', 'XLNX', 'AMD']"

"" Liu also confirmed for the first time that there is a serious ""double-booking"" effect in the industry, in which clients place orders for more chips than they actually intend to use.

mkc5ei,,wallstreetbets,post,1617595208,"Institutional Investors Recently Buying GME and Not Exiting Full PositionI wanted to take a deeper look into GME and what the hedge funds have been doing recently with the stock. I know a lot of you have your doubts about Fintel but I have a membership account and I don't believe all the data should be dismissed.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that a lot of hedge funds have not fully exited their position in GameStop. If we take a look at Institutional Ownership, there have been no fully executed exited positions with Hedge Funds recently. Are other institutional investors starting to believe that the shorts are in trouble? I believe so, here's some data to back that claim up.

Edit: I had to remove the screenshots from Fintel ,but I can tell by the average share of the price that the positions taken have been done recently.

If you take a look at GME stock during the dates of 25MAR2021 - 27MAR2021 and then compare that to the buys from Fintel, you can see there is a correlation. I believe that the hedge funds were coordinating an effort to surge the stock price and then drop it to deflate positivity about this stock. Unfortunately for them it did not work and GME quickly gained resistance at around the price of around 180. This leads me to believe that the available shares that they can purchase to influence the stock price is no longer significant enough to drop the price as drastically as before. 

Edit \^ OR they do have enough shares to drop the price even lower but they figured out that the apes would just buy the dip. We all know that they all hedge on their shorts so they don't get margin called or are too imbalanced and prone to a huge loss in either direction. In my my opinion they will run out of capitol eventually when that is who knows? That is why I always encourage to buy shares not options. When one buys losing options you are only benefiting the market maker. In this case it would be Citadel's Market Maker Division. Where do you think those earnings go to? That's why I only buy shares with CASH NEVER on Margin.

Also a tip, use the indicator ""Accumulation/Distribution Indicator for analyzing Charts (Indicator available in Yahoo Finance)  Anything above a +5 is usually an indicator that a stock price is going up due to buying from institutional investors. Unfortunately for now they are the only ones that have the available capital to be able to buy a stock to affect it's price that dramatically. Anything under an Accumulation/Distribution Indicator of 0 leads me to believe that the price is going up due to retail investors buying the stock.

This is not financial advice, I just believe dearly in this stock and what it might be able to do for others in the future =)

mk5h3m,,wallstreetbets,post,1617572208,"The US Gov't has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation**TL;DR: The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation. A 1% underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year. It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades.**

For background, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates inflation. It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque, and has been changed numerous times over the years. The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number. [\[1\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)

Many government revenues and expenditures are inflation-linked, either directly or indirectly.

**Directly linked:**

1. Social security payments

Social security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI-W (very similar to the CPI) [\[2\]](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/COLA/colasummary.html). Every year, the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation. It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth \~**$37 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by **$370 billion.**

2) Tax brackets

Tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation [\[3\]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp). This means, when the government underreports inflation, more people move up into higher tax brackets. It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues.

3) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities

These are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back, in both interest and principle, according to inflation. They are linked to the CPI. These securities (known as TIPS) compromise \~8% of the US federal debt [\[4\]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/tips.aspx). This is **\~$2.24 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by **$22 billion.** There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt.

**Indirectly linked:**

1. Debt interest payments

Investors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation. The US government has **\~$26 trillion** in Treasury debt. The yearly cost of servicing this debt is \~1-2% of that, roughly **$378 billion** in 2020. If investors were to expect higher inflation, this yearly cost would go up by \~**$260 billion** for every 1% increase in expected inflation.

There are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation, these are just the main ones I could find. When we add up all these policies, we see that underreporting inflation by just 1% can save the government **between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year**. This is 30% of the entire tax revenue of the US government. Underreporting inflation by 3-4% a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year.

**Evidence of underreporting**

There has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited. Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation?

1. Changes to the CPI formula

""Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living.1﻿ Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).

Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI."" [\[5\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)

Essentially, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported. When a good is considered to be of ""increased quality,"" its price increase is lowered to reflect this. When the price of one good goes up, its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another, lower-priced good is ""substituted"" for it.

2) Rent

In 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [\[6\]](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/). This is an increase of **54%**, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [\[7\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL), which is only a **31%** increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by **1.1%** per year. Keep in mind that, during the period just mentioned, the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen, during the 2007-2008 crisis. The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 [\[8\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA). Nonetheless, rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI.

What do you think? Is the US government massively underreporting inflation?",

Two apes, both living in separate oceans in their respective marine mammalian whale-like state, each looked out upon the watery landscape.  Each of them was searching for tendies but each saw the landscape before them quite differently. For one was summing near the surface and felt the only way to go was down. The other had been swimming at the bottom of the ocean and was quite certain things would have to go up. Both apes, with tendies in their hearts and diamonds in their mutant little ape fins swam about in the ebbing tides as they listened for the soothing sounds of other distant sea-gorillas.  Only time would tell if the two would find the tendies. Or perhaps they would meet and make beautiful sea monkeys. Or perhaps they would stray too close to a Japanese fishing boat and lose it all.

mkk98g,,wallstreetbets,post,1617628007,"TSLA effective short interest could be as high as 26% - potential incoming short squeeze**TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction & options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

Here are the breadcrumbs I followed to get to the conclusion.

1. The company recently won EU approval for its drug VASCEPA with exclusivity.
2.  China exclusivity will probably come online by end of year. Already got the ok for Hainan Medical Hub.
3. Insiders recently sold shares on Form 4's, but the bear minimum to cover taxes most likely .
4. Paid off all long term debt in one fell swoop. Plus has $900 Million loss carryforward.
5. But here is the kicker. They recently added the line ""**In the case of a Change of Control**"" under remarks. That wasn't there before. Link to one of the Form 4, if the picture doesn't load.

mkkn2w,,wallstreetbets,post,1617629110,"$ROOT: Rise of the Seed of the APES 🚀**I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a literal retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position of my portfolio in $ROOT. So, proceed on your own risk... In addition, a lot of my DD was taken from C\*(i)Tron.**

I'll keep it short and simple... This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR.

1- **Short Interest is 47.36%** (Fintel  2021-03-31). In addition, o**nly 2,000 shares were available for shorting o**n 04-01 2021-04-01 13:08:53 UTC(Fintel) with **a borrow rate of 8.71%!!**(2021-04-01 18:18:33 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10,  that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. **We had 47.36% on Thursday** so a **short squeeze** is inevitable?

In comparison **of $ROOTS short interest of 47.6%(2021-03-31), $GME has a short interest of 18.81(2021-03-31) and $AMC 17.31%( 2021-03-31).**

2- Forget about the short squeeze... It also have a very high potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$. The open interest of all the calls for Only 16 April is 32,261. In addition, the open interest bellow 15$ is 16,414 **which equals 1,641,400 shares!!!!** .Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**.

3-  ROOT is massively **undervalued**, Without factoring the massive short squeeze and Gamma squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.

4- For Growth, the step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie). Bellow is the Chart:

5-  As the end of 2020, ROOT had 323K auto and 8K renters policies in force. According to the NAIC, **there were a total of 49 auto and 1 renters complaints against ROOT in 2020**. Which **indicates the BS that $ROOT shorts are claiming about customer complaints**. Additionally, I dare you to find any insurance company without complaints.

6- For the past week, everyday even today(weekend), I was receiving a ThinkOrSwim news notification advertising for a class action lawsuit against $ROOT. Some days I even receive it a few times a day, the same notification. The shorts are relentless in pushing this news while you have to keep in mind that Class Action Lawsuits **can take up to several years to conclude**. In addition, I dare you to find an old enough (Billion level company) which didn't or isn't facing a class action lawsuit. In my opinion, It's a distraction and FUD in the news cycle by the Shorts. Class action lawsuits are shitty law firms trying to make a name for themselves(IMO).

7- It has a relatively small market cap of 3.07B and a very small float. It reminds me of $GME preSqueeze when it was 3.5-3.7B now it's(13.39B).

**My short term Price target is 50$+ if a Short Squeeze +/- Gamma squeeze perfectly happens**",

I did their trial because I was curious, turns out that despite being 10/10 the whole time, I'm more expensive than I am with Allstate and Geico. The reason? They tracked and projected my annual miles. Every insurer understands that people lie about mileage, it's an accepted fact, that's why they rate everyone based on ~10,000 miles a year. ROOT limits their market to a very small group of people by doing this, and those people can get better rates with Milewise. Imo root is going to get bought by a larger company, especially if their back end is worth a damn. They have a good idea but their experience is lacking, they don't understand the business, and the market they started in will keep them fucked for a while. Google ""underwriting cycle"", ROOT is going to be a big insurer once rates go back up. Right now I'm absolutely convinced that, at least in Virginia, rates are too low to cover payouts. Sooner or later they'll have to increase, and ROOT will be the same price. That's the time you want to play around.",['GOOGL']

mkb16c,,wallstreetbets,post,1617591016,"Corsair Gaming - CRSR - Small Cap, Big Gains**Company Background:** Corsair Gaming provides gear for gamers and content creators. Their products range from keyboards to high-end gaming PCs.

**Opportunity:** Sold off hard in March giving you an entry opportunity.

**Revenue Growth:**

|Year|Revenue (Billions)|Year Over Year Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|0.9||
|2019|1.1|17|
|2020|1.7|55|
|2021|1.8 - 1.95 (CRSR Guidance)|6 - 15|

2020 was a huge year for Corsair and their revenue growth can largely be attributed to the Covid lockdowns. However, even after growing revenue 55% YoY they expect to post strong numbers again in 2021. Personally, I expect them to be in the 1.9 to 2 billion revenue range. Online gaming is huge and continues to grow. Streaming is also a growing market that Corsair competes in. 71% of millennial gamers in the U.S. watch gaming content on streaming platforms.

The gaming industry was valued at 162 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach 296 billion by 2026.

**Valuation:**

||Corsair Gaming|Logitech|S&P 500 Information Technology Sector\*\*\*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Forward P/E|19|25|29|
|Price Sales|1.83|4.17|6.23|
|Market Cap|3.1 Billion|18.2 Billion||
|Revenue|1.7 Billion (Double-digit growth)|3 Billion (Single-digit growth)||

Corsair and Logitech have significant overlap in product categories. However, Corsair has premium pricing compared to Logitech. Corsair has a strong brand name in the gaming community allowing them to leverage premium pricing.

\*\*\*Not an apples-to-apples comparison. I included it to give you an idea of the sector metrics as a whole.

**Channel Relationships:**

|Americas|APAC|EMEA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Micro Center,.....|Amazon, JD, SYNNEX,.....|Amazon, Media Markt, Midfactory.de, Exertis,...|

Corsair has strong channel relationships and I expect them to grow as the gaming market expands. More importantly, they already have a global distribution network established.

**""AnAlYsT aNd ExpErtS"":** Price targets from $37 to $55 giving you an upside of 9% to 62%. I don't look at price targets but I included them for those that do.

**My Play:** 400 shares (looking at houses so I didn't have much to throw at it). I don't see the gaming industry or high-end PC industry slowing down anytime soon. I see long-term growth which is why I went for shares. I've sold and closed some CC's so my cost basis is in the Mid 34s.

He did something similar in 2018-19 pre Archegos Interest. Let’s discuss.

First let me address why this matters and what VIAC essentially is set up to do in the Long term for my smooth brain apes. 

Now VIAC common stock jumped relatively 20% when our Tiger king Hwang jumped in on behalf of Archegos for this stock, however after being hit with one of the largest margin calls in US history he was forced to liquidate mass amounts of shares. 
This can be seen in the picture below at market open each day. Volume Consistent with what a consolidating sell off looks like. Point being it’s consolidated and ready to fucking explode. it isn’t a short squeeze situation because of the massive amount of shares available as well as the mixed bag of short/long option interest associated with the stock.

Just to put this in perspective CBS holds the rights to Paramount+, The Masters, March Madness and recently signed an 11 year agreement with the NFL. 

The NFL IS A 2 BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR SPACE AND THEY COMMITTED TO TELEVISE FOR 11 YEARS. 
NFLX CURRENTLY TRADES FOR 540 as solely a streaming platform. With nearly 10x the market cap of VIAC. 

250B for NFLX compared to 25B. However With CBS partnering with the NFL, PGA, and working towards perfecting Paramount as a platform. It’s not unreal to think the future will include NFLX pursuing an acquisition... in need of a sport entity within their algo. VIAC is positioned to fill the void. 

Diversification into Professional Sports is on the top of NFLX to do list for satisfying new investing rounds. Notice industry pressure from other companies > Hulu Live Sports , ESPN +, HBO live etc. 

To conclude. VIAC IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOREVER AS LONG AS NFL, PGA, AND JIM NANCE ARE AROUND TO KEEP BREATHING. MASSIVE VALUE TO BE MADE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. 



This stock is giving everyone the opportunity to get in on a Pre-Hedge evaluation of a Monopoly Stock looking forward. Of course I’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice but a bet on VIAC right now looks pretty tasty. Personally holding 20 x 45$ calls expiring 5/21.

This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made 2 days back. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.

**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported

* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.

**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab™ stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. 

**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.

**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound 

**SOME FAQ’s:**

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments

mkal7x,,wallstreetbets,post,1617589414,"The Uranium Bull Thesis Is Playing Out To Perfection. A $500bn Market Is Emerging. A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable!With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the uranium market, focusing a bit on SWU, which I am very fond of haha. As always, I look forward to any feedback.  

As am sure all are aware, we have seen a 15% jump in spot over last 2 weeks. While the increase was in large part to non-producing mines physical purchasing , I noticed a number of discussions on Reddit and various Discord servers, StockTwits also, seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot U was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle.

Experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Rather, a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the SWU enrichment price.

Based in large part on SWU projections, many expert investors are forecasting a $500bn market. For perspective, during the last cycle, the market peaked at \~$150bn.

***So... what is SWU?***

For those very new to uranium investing, a very quick overview might be helpful. Also, for those more familiar than I am, I appreciate the feedback.

SWU (short for Separative Work Unit) is a measure for the cost of enrichment. Generally speaking, when SWU prices are low, utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries (i.e., carry trades).

Conversely, a rise in SWU signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing. As excess inventories are utilized by end users, the utilities (no longer aided by the secondary market) instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices. It follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle; from conversion (UF6) and even fabricated fuel purchasing, to the beginning (i.e. spot U308), which in turn drives those spot prices up.

Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, higher SWU prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online. McArthur and Cigar Lake, for example, need at least the $40's, and for Paladin, likely in the $50s in order to justify their operational costs.

Therefore, **SWU is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle**.

Even when there are false starts/spikes in the market (which we’ve seen in the past couple years), SWU price is consistent.

***What is the current SWU price?***

SWU bottomed out at $\~34 in August 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following Fukushima.

Since hitting that low, SWU has been on a relative straight line upwards, currently estimated at \~$54. This steady growth over the past 2.5 years is one of, if not the most, compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector.

***So... how the \*\*\*\* is SWU forecasting a $500bn market?!***

Of course, there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing. It's becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging (i.e., breaking news this week on EU Green energy qualifications, the White House endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard).

However, more-so than anything SWU is at the core of the bull thesis, which is, that ***decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power*** (Duke Energy Corp. just said the same yesterday...)

As SWU prices continue to rise, **it is inevitable that equity prices will follow**. Denison is a fun example. 

Even now , I'm still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that Denison isn't actually producing any uranium. When utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at SWU in the $60s, $70s, $80s, and beyond, those mines will turn the lights back on. The fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts. It won't be long before Denison’s prices start to rise. The same idea goes with Cominak, Ranger, etc.

Moreover, what happens when we've exhausted Cigar Lake and Kazatomprom? Or McArthur River? 

It isn't just that we have a rising demand, we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 2025-2030. The investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting. 

***And why $500bn***? 

Frankly, I think $500bn is conservative, though something in this vicinity I have seen as the consensus among many experts. Market cap for publicly traded uranium is at 125bn right now, and this is only the very beginning. Ultimately, there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity (i.e., hedge funds), and they are looking for value. Taking $URNM as one example, the AUM just months ago when it IPO'd was a few million. Now AUM is $175mm. We also cannot ignore what is happening in China. It is a huge growth story there. There is also a SPEC frenzy.  

But again, looking at the big picture, more-so than anything else, I keep going back to SWU. For me, it is the most powerful predictor of the multi-year bull run to come. And while there will always be doubtful retail who, to their credit, have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years, you cannot deny what 2.5 years of rising SWU enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle.

Again, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree. Any and all feedback is appreciated!",['DUK']

Take note of the VERY predictable pattern that happens almost *always* the week or two before APHA earnings. They usually rise between 10% to 20% the week or two before. Regardless of what the outcome of earnings, there is a very reliable trading to be had here. 

APHA Earnings are going to be released on April 12th, Tuesday morning prior to market open. I *think* monday of this week will be a down day for Cannabis stocks and will make for an amazing entry into this very high probability trade. 

On top of this incredibly reliable pattern prior to earnings there are additional bullish tail winds that could drive the stock even higher. 

1. Last week Chuck Schumer said that Cannabis legalization legislation (at the federal level) would be coming very soon. He's already delivered on the SAFE Banking Act (which will GREATLY reduce cost of operating a cannabis company and will make it **MUCH** easier for them to raise money and get insurance and banking services.) So I have no reason to doubt that he'll deliver on rescheduling cannabis. 

2. APHA / TLRY merger completing on 4/20 (stoner chuckle, yeah forrr tweentyyy blaze it bro!).

3. TLRY & APHA both jumped substantially after last earnings as both we're very, very solid earnings reports showing the companies gaining market share. 

4. NY Legalized adult use Cannabis, NY of course being one of the largest markets in the US. 

5. APHA bought a Craft Beer company called 'Sweetwater'. On top of the fact that beer is actually good, alcohol consumption in the US is at an all time high. 

So take a look at the charts. Watch the price action tomorrow and if you like the trade idea, buy some calls and sell half or all of them before earnings, or be degenerate gambler and hold them all through earnings.",

I would describe them similar to Dick's but more focused on their core selling points, they aren't spending money making their stores look like a extravegent mall. I have been too ASO many times and overall enjoy their store & from my personal experience they have been consistently busy this past year and the days ammo arrives there is always a line around the building at 7 am of people trying to get some before they sell out. 

ASO IPO'd in October of 2020. ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock. Last week they absolutely smashed earnings by doubling EPS. Estimated was .46 and actual was 1.09 Their revenue increased as well. Their net sales increased 18% over last year. They have a market cap of 2.63 B and trade at a P/E of 7.66 as compared to Dick's which trades at a P/E of 13.85.  As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compareded to its peers. IPO lockup period ended on 3/31 which caused a negative dip on open that day but the stock finished postive on the day as there was not a mass sell off as shorters of the stock had hoped for. 

 The stock has been shorted from the start because I believe it was just lumped into the typical brick & mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping. This was a grave miscalculation as ASO provides a niche varitey of products that the online space is not fulfiilling adequetly & their top compeitor Dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo. They have a current short interest of 39% with a public float of 31 M. The stock currently is at a all time high of $29, that means every single instution that shorted this stock is negative now and they have 9 days to cover their positions. With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similair to the one that happened with RKT. I don't see this stock tripling or anything of the scale that GME had but I do see a substaintial price increase soon if the right factors materialize. 

Open interest for 4/16 30 strike calls are huge and if the volume comes in and pushes the stock up we could be looking at quite the squeeze for this bad boy. 

TLDR: ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at a ATH with high short interest which makes it prime for a squeeze. 

Positions: (9) 4/16 30 strike &  (2) 4/16 25 strike calls

mktnmp,,wallstreetbets,post,1617653356,"Options are for Apes too (just not GME)# What Motivates an Ape

I started this project due to the **lack of options data available to the everyday ape**. While some broker platforms have pretty great tools for retail level investment, they are not clear or easy to use. 3-5 times per day, I've been scraping the entire options chain for most of the meme stocks and high volume tickers. I've been collecting data for about a month now. 

I wanted to share some data with my fellow apes that I think presents good information in a clear and easy to understand way. Recently, there has been reports of a drop in option activity from retail investors. It would be a shame if this degeneracy didn't continue, so I'm sharing some data which I think is interesting and helpful to the ape community.

I've noticed a lot of **newcomers that are scared of options** (probably due to massive losses/gains posted by smooth-brained brotheren). However, once you understand the risks you're taking, options can be a powerful tool for both adding or reducing risk on your degenerate bets. You can continue to make degenerate bets if you like, but at least grasp what you're doing. 

For this post, I'm going to assume *some* working knowledge of what options are, but here is link with a more basic explanation I wrote earlier: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization\_of\_all\_open\_option\_contracts\_on\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1ahd5/visualization_of_all_open_option_contracts_on_gme/)

# Comparing MSFT to GME

My presumption here is that Microsoft is a stable stock where the option data trends are representative of the current state of the equity options market (or is at least is similar to other stable stocks. *Note,* *I dug through a bunch of tickers and this seemed like a reasonable assertion*).

**An important note on greeks:** Looking at options in terms of the greeks is necessary to quantify how much they will change in value, especially if you're going to basket multiple options together or make complex trades. However, it seems like these statistical models may not always apply in highly volatile situations like GME. 

If you're reading this and think the greeks are people from a country that makes dank meat dishes with yogurt based sauce, worry not because this information doesn't require you to really understand them. I am plotting purely in terms of absolutes. That is, **1.) How much does the option contract cost, 2.) How many people are buying it, 3.) How volatile is it?** 

**How do the price of GME options compare to MSFT?**

The main take-away here is how much of a range there is with GME option prices that are out of the money. The other is how expensive GME options are. 

For sake of just gaining an understanding of how options are priced, please understand that almost all option prices for most any stock will follow roughly the same trends and curves as above. This may not help us trade, but it will help you understand **why yolo'ing your savings on weeklies is a dumb idea.**  

**No one is buying GME Options!!**

If you look at exactly how many contracts are out there, you will see that pretty much no one is buying GME. However, it does look like people are successfully selling way out of the money puts (probably purchased by apes on here). 

&#x200B;

[Option open interest indicates nobody is buying GME options. This is likely due to their exorbitant cost and massive associated risk.](https://preview.redd.it/q3466ujtner61.png?width=12054&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c8590800ad6f0652cb7452173625f2e541448c)

Notice how MSFT has a much more even distribution of puts and calls. People are betting both sides, and option strikes being bought are much closer to the stock price. 

**Implied volatility and why/how thetagang makes money**

Implied volatility or IV is a often not precisely defined quantitatively. It can be calculated using different options pricing models using an iterative method. However, for purposes of this writeup, you may think of **IV and demand interchangeably.** If an option has high IV, there is often corresponding demand. 

What is interesting is that IV is really high for options really close to expiry, even with Microsoft (i.e a stable stock). This would indicate that these options near expiry ***should be cheaper,*** but they're not. **There is a demand for (weeklies, FDs, yolo's whatever you want to call them)**. This would indicate that people are **buying these options to protest against sudden downswings** (historically this is the reason). **More recently, retail apes are treating weeklies like a casino**, which has likely compounded to even higher IV. 

This phenomenon of high IV for upcoming expiry is known as the volatility smile. It was actually first notice after the crash in 1987, since people suddenly became terrified of flash crashed and began protesting themselves with cheap, way out of the money options. 

Thetagang will sell these high IV options on a week-to-week bases to collect a small profit with a large amount of leverage (if not covered). It's also how selling covered calls can make you money. You risk getting burned if the stock price moves against you, but the higher the IV, the more upside there is to selling that option. You just go bankrupt of if you don't have the cash or stock to cover in the event things don't move your way. 

Implied volatility for both MSFT and GME show a volatility smile. Note GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. 

&#x200B;

Notice how GME is heavily skewed toward the out of the money side on puts, and the in the money side of calls. In my opinion, this is due to the market makers probably trying to gouge retail and/or setting prices high to deter retail from purchasing GME options that they would need to hedge. The massive spread supports this opinion.

# Conclusion

GME options are expensive and some people appear to have made a tidy profit by selling way out of the money puts. This didn't require the long winded explanation given here to figure out, but I hope to have made some wrinkles in some ape brains.

Use the information above, and please try to understand that options prices change non-linearly and is the reason why they feel like a lottery. Use the information above to more safely trade options (i.e. buy further out in time, expect the value of your option to drop in said time, buy closer to the money).

***Most importantly, this is not investment advice. None of this is guaranteed to be accurate. Please do your own research and make your own decisions.***

Positions: 100 shares of VXX and 100 shares of SQQ, getting absolutely hosed on both. Too stubborn to stop now.

mkt7qi,,wallstreetbets,post,1617652200,"The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against AmericaDisclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.

Disclosure: RIDE stock will triple by September. 🚀🚀🚀 Do what you will with this information.

I hadn’t posted on reddit until recently when [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report. 

Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down. 

And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:

1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.

2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.

Okay, let’s get started.

&#x200B;

**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**

Per Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

U.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\*\*\*\*.”*

“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.

&#x200B;

**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**

I’m from Ohio, and about 2 years ago now, I saw [over 1500 people in our small community lose their jobs when GM closed their state-of-the-art facility](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gut-wrenching-day-ohio-gm-assembly-plant-prepares-close-n980136). Words couldn’t accurately portray the amount of hurt and pain that hit Ohio as a result of this. 

But a couple of months later, I heard about LMC. I heard GM was going to invest in LMC in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). I then had a couple of friends get hired there who told me they were getting a jump start in the EV industry with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). Keep in mind, this was 2019, so large-scale production of EV’s was a relatively new concept. 

Nonetheless, this was exactly what our community needed – some hope and excitement. American-made electric vehicles in small-town Ohio – helping create a more sustainable future and adding thousands of jobs in our country. Plus, this was a massive opportunity, as the [global light duty vehicle market is now valued at \~ $600B](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market).

Fast forward 2 years, and [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all). 

&#x200B;

**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**

I will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**

Hindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.

Well, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.

The betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**

Well, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report. 

Ultimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.

To address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/). This is huge for LMC to have their battery supplier as a next-door neighbor.

Btw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx). 

Plans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV. 🚀 🚀 🚀

This claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders** 

First and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.

This is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.

Additionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.

Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period. 

&#x200B;

**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**

Lordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.

Developing these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).

Sure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.

LMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.

LMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).

u/DrReginaldWexley owns and operates his own small fleet of vehicles. I found [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/md063x/the_transition_is_real_its_happening_now_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I thought was useful to learn more from a customer’s perspective.

&#x200B;

**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**

I decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did? 

What I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”

&#x200B;

**Why is this finding significant?**

Well, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.

Think about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.

I would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.

&#x200B;

**Proof of Concept for LMC’s Endurance truck**

LMC is showing their level of confidence in their vehicle by enrolling in [one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd) – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17. Get your popcorn ready, this **major catalyst is now less than 2 weeks away** and will be publicly televised. 🚀 🚀 🚀

LMC is also in the [final due diligence phase for the ATVM loan](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which could be announced any day now. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means there has been substantial digging into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring.

Sure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.

&#x200B;

**Brief Technical Overview**

From a technical perspective, the chart shows that this same downward movement has happened multiple times in the past 6 months, and each time, the stock has (quickly) rebounded back to $30. Violent moves downward are frequently followed by violent moves upward in these low-float, volatile stocks. 

I recently saw some extremely detailed [technical analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/lordstownmotors/comments/me2bro/weve_all_heard_the_fundamentals_for_a_bull_case/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this stock for if you’re more of a trader than an investor. For folks who trade stocks based on indicators, the [recent Beta release](https://www.truckinginfo.com/10140497/lordstown-unveils-two-betas-of-endurance-pickup) could be the catalyst we needed to begin an upward trend back towards $30 and beyond. 🚀 🚀 🚀

&#x200B;

**Position:**

1500 shares that I will be holding onto for several years, and a few October calls for once they are pumping out trucks this fall 🚀🚀🚀

I’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.9B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story. It’s a damn shame that Hindenburg wrongfully attacked a company in small-town Ohio that is bringing 1000’s of jobs to our country. My advice to Hindenburg: Never bet against America.

I RIDE with Lordstown. #WorkForIt #MadeInAmerica

mku17p,,wallstreetbets,post,1617654388,"SKLZ - Why my smooth 🧠thinks the dip will keep dipping - 🦍Friendly 🌈🐻DD# ⚠ No 🧠 wrinkles to be found here ⚠ I'm just a guy who doesn't like a stock. My dislike of SKLZ is fueled by a dislike of their product, a mobile gambling plugin.

# I think that SKLZ has already reached it's core market and is due for continued price correction, and here is why:

# 👵Bingo is not an Esport

SKLZ top earning Bingo and Solitaire style apps do not appeal to mainstream gamers the same way PC Esport titles do. SKLZ has yet to offer a a game, **that accounts for any meaningful revenue**\*\*\*,\*\*\* outside of this genre. A connection between SKLZ to the Esports industry is made whenever an investor that bought this stock at the $40 peak after the NFL deal tries to re-affirm why they are still holding.

# A literal 🦍 playing roulette has a better chance winning 💵 than you do playing SKLZ games

SKLZ 15% cut means SKLZ players need nearly a whopping 57.5% AVERAGE win rate to make money. Using these high level calculations, I have determined that the majority of SKLZ players are literally losers.

# I did more math - 15% is LESS than 30%

SKLZ monetization model conflicts with Apple's standard take on in-app transactions. Players spending money on head-to-head competitions or tournaments could instead be spending money on in-app purchases at a higher return rate for Apple. Let's say SKLZ monetization method continues to scale and SKLZ ends up becoming mainstream. As soon Apple feels SKLZ is effecting their bottom line, I think SKLZ and all of their app developers are at serious risk of losing their app store privileges, and their core revenue. **This is clearly speculation, but it's the 🍯 of my 🌈🐻 thinking. If SKLZ games are banned from the App store, this company could disappear overnight.**

# A monetization platform should make 💵, not lose 💵

Looking at Q1 2021 outlook, you can see they project a net loss nearly 30% more than expected. This company just keeps losing money, but on what? My *belief* is that Apple Ads are sustaining the growth of their core apps at a substantial loss. I think these losses will continue to grow as the company has insane expectations to hit, while it struggles to bring new apps to the platform. This platform may be incapable of scaling at a profit.

# Why the FUCK does a CEO pocket $196 million after his entire growth company LOST $120 MILLION DOLLARS last year?!

Q1 of Year 10 of Andrew's ""100 year plan"" meant selling 10% of his shares at a 2 month low, 3 months after going public. Nothing to look at here - just a well earned bonus! Is this just business as usual for the CEOs of growth companies to pocket more money than the company itself may ever profit?![https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1388470/skillz-inc-sklz-ceo-andrew-paradise-sold-1961-million-of-shares](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1388470/skillz-inc-sklz-ceo-andrew-paradise-sold-1961-million-of-shares)[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005954/en/Skillz-Outperforms-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005954/en/Skillz-Outperforms-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results)

# Since when is Google's App policy more rigid than Apple's?

Many SKLZ apps are not on the google play store and are instead installed through the web browser. I have personally always found Apple to have more strict rules on the app store than Google, and for this reason I think this indicates that again, Apple may elect to ban SKLZ games from their store.  **How is SKLZ supposed to penetrate the mainstream market when they can't get their top earning game, Blackout Bingo, on the Google play store?**

# The more 💵 a game makes with SKLZ, the more reason a developer has to drop them

Doesn't SKLZ just need a billion dollar game on their platform? Think again. **7.5% of a billion is 75 million dollars** (the cost of working through SKLZ if a developer launches a billion dollar game through them). How long would it take a team of developers, something which Game **DEVELOPERS** already have on hand, to come up with a solution to replace the SKLZ plugin? The more money a game makes from SKLZ, the more reason they have to leave, quickly. Don't let their patents fool you, any company can replicate this model, and others have already done so.

I refuse to believe that a AAA developer like EA, Ubisoft or Epic would ever be willing to give up a cent of revenue to a company like this when they could easily make their own solution in-house.

My perspective of SKLZ is that the more it works, the more likely it is to fall apart.

mk0gae,,wallstreetbets,post,1617556604,"Here's why VIAC is setting up for a strong rebound**ViacomCBS (VIAC) is down 55% in nearly two weeks and the fundamentals of the company have not changed.**

* VIAC priced an offering at $85 per share, the institutions/hedge-funds who bought at those levels have no choice but to reduce their cost basis at current levels.
* The forced liquidation of Archegos Capital lead to massive VIAC blocks being sold in the market at a discounted price, which aided to the nasty continuous sell-off. There’s been a drastic decline in volume the past few days which signals that the liquidation phase is near or at its end.
* VIAC’s bullish momentum came from a few factors: Their new streaming service Paramount+ releasing, ViacomCBS reaching 11-year agreement with the NFL, strong earnings, extremely cheap valuation relative to market, and a company that follows the value/reopening/cyclical trend in a higher yield environment.
* ViacomCBS is not some meme company, it’s a company with a strong balance sheet that produces real profits.
* Paramount+ growth and success will stem from ViacomCBS’s brands and their unique model. 
* Paramount+ offers live sports (NFL, Europa League, March Madness, Masters Tourney), news, original content, and a large library of older content from their various brands.
* ViacomCBS brands: Paramount Studios (Star Trek), Showtime (Billions) Nickelodeon (Avatar, Spongebob), CBS, BET, MTV, Comedy Central, Pluto TV, etc.
* They recently signed a 11-year contract with the NFL that gives them multi-platform rights, allows them to stream them on Paramount+.
* The launch of their new streaming service and transition into the digital age helps their growth prospects.
* Valuation currently is dirt cheap sitting at a PE Ratio of 11 and trading significantly under it’s fair value price
* Technicals: Price has been consolidating around $45, near it’s 200 DMA, multiple indicators showing oversold.
* Shorters are getting greedy, short percent of float is near 19%
* The reason to invest in VIAC over VIACA is because of the large difference in volume/liquidity in their shares and options.
* Recent Price Targets for VIAC: Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70

I have been watching companies that supply systems furniture and just did a comparison of Herman Miller and Steelcase. Both of these companies are comparable with product lines and have relatively similar financials. What is different, however, is the float held by institutions.

Another interesting number is the EBITDA for both. MLHR is 17,200  vs 138,200  for SCS. I know my brain is as smooth as the day is long, but it seems like there is something there there.

 Ticker: [BFLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BFLY/)  
   
 **TLDR**: BFLY is a software company pretending to be a medical device company.  By 2023, they will bring in significantly more revenue from subscriptions to their cloud services  than from selling their actual flagship POCUS devices. [Skip to the Bull Case](#the-bull-case)

6. Positions
  
### Overview  
[Butterfly Network](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/)  makes Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) devices and a cloud based ecosystem to back it.  
     
BFLY's flagship device is the [Butterfly iQ+](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq), a point-of-care ultrasound imaging device that connects to a smart phone or tablet.  From their website: 

> the world’s only single-probe, whole-body handheld device, powered by
> Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology
  
###  Ultrasound?  Isn't that the thing where you slather a bunch of jelly on a pregnant woman's belly and x-ray her unborn baby?  Who cares about that shit?  
    
 Doctors do.  Doctors care about that shit.  And you can do a lot more than take pictures of your wife's boyfriend's unborn child.  

What do doctors use ultrasounds for?  In short, they allow doctors to look inside their patients.  Doctors can use ultrasounds to diagnose conditions, including those in the heart, blood vessels, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, uterus, ovaries, eyes, thyroid, and testicles.  
  
Point of Care Ultrasound, or POCUS, is all about using sonography to diagnose problems wherever a patient is being treated, whether that's in a modern hospital, an ambulance, or a remote village.  
   
POCUS has been touted, albeit probably hyperbolically, as the 'replacement for the stethoscope'. 

### Competition 
  
A traditional Ultrasound machine, [looks like this](https://www.medcorpllc.com/product/philips-epiq-7/), and costs anywhere from $15,000 to over $100,000, and needs to be wheeled around on a cart.      
  
Butterfly IQ+ costs $2000, is about the size of an electric razor, and works with an iPad or smartphone.  This is because of their patented 'Ultrasound on a Chip' technology.  
  
  

The image the IQ+ produces is not as high quality as a traditional ultrasound, but for many applications, super high resolution imagery is just not necessary to make accurate diagnosis.  It's not meant to be a total replacement for traditional sonography, more like a 21st century stethoscope.
  

    
   Phillips, GE, and others have attempted (poorly) to enter the POCUS space.  They are all significantly more expensive and less feature rich:  
   
   [GE VScan $7900](https://canadiem.org/handheld-ultrasound-a-review-of-the-vscan/)  
   [Phillip's Lumify $7000](https://www.aedsuperstore.com/lumify-ultrasound-system-philips-healthcare.html)  
   [Clarius $4900](https://clarius.com/scanners/l15/l15-pricing/)    
   [**Butterfly IQ+ $2000**](https://store.butterflynetwork.com/us/en/product/butterfly-iq/pro/)    
 
  Butterfly is the only solution that covers linear, curved and phased mode with a single probe. GE offers a dual-probe-one-device solution that is not cost effective. Philips is even more ridiculous, you have to buy three probes to cover all the spectrum.  
    
 Butterfly owns a stack of patents for their proprietary technology including 'Ultrasound on a Chip'  https://www.butterflynetwork.com/patents  
   
 Butterfly Network has agreements in place with the majority of the largest 100 hospitals in the United States and is commercially available in more than 20 countries including the United States, Canada, greater Europe and Australia.


    
## The Bull Case: 
  
### This is a SAAS company disguised as a medical device company  
(**S**oftware **A**s **A** **S**ervice you fucking smoothbrain).
  
 From Butterfly's March 29th earnings call:  
 > Product revenues for the full year 2020 were $38.3 million, an increase of 53% from $25.1 million in 2019  
 > ....  
> Subscription revenues were $7.9 million in 2020, growing 216% from
> $2.5 million in 2019. 

**Hold up. Did I hear that right?**
**216% Year over year subscription revenues**.    
**4x the growth of their device sales.**  
  
Given that rate, software sales would basically catch up to hardware sales by 2022 and almost double them by 2023.  
 
| Year| Device Revenue (53% YoY) | Subscription Revenue (216% YoY)
| ----------- | ----------- |----
| 2020 | 38.3m | 7.9m
| 2021 | 58.6m | 25m
| 2022 | 89.7m | 78.9m
| 2023 | 137.2m | 249.3m
  
Butterfly's software is seriously impressive, comprehensive, and ambitious.    
https://www.butterflynetwork.com/enterprise  
   
We're talking HIPAA compliant Document solutions / storage, Billing, Telemedicine, Workflows, Credentialing, Education, Fleet Management, Analytics, QA, etc.  

This is not an app thrown together to support a device.  This is an ecosystem.  

While the iQ+ is an innovative, best in class product that is selling like hotcakes, BFLY's holders are actually going to get rich off that sweet, sweet subscription revenue.  

### Supply Chain  

Wait a minute.. 'Ultrasound on a Chip'? As in 'Chip Shortage'?  
How are they going to continue to rapidly grow their subscription revenues if there is a crunch on production of their devices amidst a global chip shortage?  

From their earnings call, during the Q&A:  

> we have a very strong partnership with TSMC and that's both an
> engineering partnership that has been going for the last years. We've
> looked to develop the iQ+ as well as a manufacturing partnership. As
> part of that, we do have a committed supply agreement with them. And
> so, **we feel very confident, both in their ability to deliver the
> semiconductor wafers that we need for our current production, as well
> as to help us meet additional demand, should it materialize**. We think
> this partnership is a competitive strength and the availability of
> wafers in the midst of a global shortage is just one example of the
> value of that partnership.

Looks like they're all set.  Can Phillips and GE say the same right now?

### Jonathan Rothberg  
  
Butterfly Network's founder and top shareholder also happens to be the dude who invented high-speed, “Next-Gen” DNA sequencing.  [Jonathan Rothberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rothberg).  
  
This guy is a certifiable genius.  He runs an incubator called [4Catelyzer](https://www.4catalyzer.com/) that has a focus on 'medicine, engineering, and machine learning', it looks like a bullpen of potential future Butterflies.  

He's also the founder of Quantum-Si which is going public via SPAC merger.
  
###  Aunt Cathie and ARKG
    
 Alright, you knew it was coming.  We can't ignore the fact that ARK funds have been absolutely gobbling up BFLY since it went public via SPAC merger with LGVW.  
   
 https://cathiesark.com/arkg-holdings-of-bfly  
   
 ARKG has doubled its stake in BFLY in the past month.  
 

 

[In this interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/17/arks-cathie-wood-on-deep-value-stocks.html) from Feb 17, Cathie talks about an upcoming 'valuation reset' and how ARK will consolidate into 'higher conviction' holdings.  She also happens to name drop Butterfly specifically.  

Since then, a valuation reset has certainly occurred (or is occurring) for many of ARK's holdings, and ARK has consistently and aggressively accumulated BFLY.   

As of Friday 4/3/21 ARKG owned 3.74% of BFLY and it made up 1.05% of the fund.  Both significant increases from just a month prior.    
  
**Recent purchases**:  

| Date | Number of Shares Purchased
| ----------- | ----------- 
| April 1 | 274300
| March 31 | 621228 
| March 30 | 487344 
| March 29 | 232316 
| March 25 | 127800

| March 16 | 155191 
| March 8 | 233248
| March 5 | 989100
| March 4 | 554757
| March 3 | 390584

Just under 900k shares in the last 2 trading days alone.  

### Pets  

Pet stocks have been on an absolute tear this year and don't really seem to be slowing down (CHWY, IDXX, ZTS, CHD  ).  
  
 Cue [Butterfly Network iQ Vet](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/vet/iq-vet), a solution tailored specifically for Veterinarians with an affordable pricing plan.  

***Integrated Pet Telemedicine*** sounds like a fucking meme designed to trigger wallstreet algos to buy but that's [literally what they are offering](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/vet/teleguidance-vet ).   

  
### Developing Countries  
   
 It doesn't take a genius to figure out why a $2000 POCUS that connects to a mobile phone would be a game changer for practitioners in developing countries / remote areas.  NYT article from last year:  
    
  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/health/medical-scans-butterfly-iq.html  
    
Did I mention the [B&M Gates Foundation Strategic Investment Fund](https://sif.gatesfoundation.org/investments/butterfly-network/) is an early investor in BFLY?  


### Technical Setup
[Drew a line on the chart with a crayon for the TA boiz](https://ibb.co/VLQgMdm)  


### The Bear Case  
They are currently spending more than they are bringing in.  
  
They have competitors with a large moats and market share in the space they are trying to disrupt.  
  
They are a growth stock in a market that seems to be finicky about growth right now.   
    
3B Market Cap on  $45 million revenue last year.  

Limited TAM
   
SPAC merger  
  
ARK touch of death  
  

## Conclusion  

- Their cloud based subscription business is growing significantly faster than their hardware sales and at the current rate of growth will surpass hardware sales by 2022-2023.    
- They are delivering the best device for the lowest cost in a genuinely disruptive space and backing it with a seriously impressive ecosystem.  
- iQ Vet for Veterinarians has expanded their potential market and could accelerate the business' growth.  
- Cathie and ARK funds fucking *love* this thing.

1. $BFLY’s 2020 Form 10k indicated an operating loss that surpassed 2019. I understand a growing medical company has substantial costs for research and development. Also retaining top talent is expensive which only adds to operating costs. Lastly the FDA has increased guidelines their pre-market approval and clear - which has resulted in higher costs to get a new product to market. These costs can be absorbed by existing companies but $BFLY being a newer company doesn’t have the same resources. So how will this get funded? If they issue more equity it will dilute existing shareholders.

2. You mention competitors- you forgot about Canon Medical Systems (f/k/a Toshiba), Hitachi and Siemens Healthineers. If $BFLY plans to undercut their competitors for cost of the equipment how do they plan to be profitable? Are there additional revenue streams in the works? 

3. Lastly they rely on a single source for both their semiconductors $TSMC (Taiwan semiconductors) and for manufacturing a single source contract with Benchmark Electronics Inc. Having sole sources for raw materials and manufacturing can lead to inherent risks getting to market. Also most of $TSMC chips come from abroad. Yes they have a plant in Washington state but it is an older facility and may not supply the chips to $BFLY.",

If you are looking for an infrastructure investment look not further than $PAVE ETF. It’s holdings are well diversified across the physical, digital, and energy infrastructure found in the bill. And options are still very cheap at the moment.

Here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha:

The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) is in an excellent position to directly benefit from President Biden's American Jobs Plan that was announced on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, PA. The proposed plan targets over $1.4 trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation, schools, hospitals, and buildings as well as for energy, water, and digital infrastructure. The PAVE ETF holds many of the companies that will provide the materials, tools, services, and components required for this infrastructure build-out and should handsomely benefit from it.

INVESTMENT RATIONALE

President Biden presented the American Jobs Plan (part of his ""build back better"" initiative) on Wednesday in Pittsburgh and the White House published a FACT SHEET on its website. In a nutshell, a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the American Jobs Plan is shown below:

PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:

- Transportation infrastructure (621B)
- Buildings, schools and hospitals (250+B)
- Infrastructure resilience (50B)

ENERGY, WATER AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE

- Cleantech, clean energy, and related infra (300+B)
- Water Utilities (111B)
- Digital infrastructure (100b)

In total, the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over $1.4 trillion. The investment thesis here is simple: find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars.

Let's take a look at the PAVE ETF and see what its prospects are going forward.

TOP HOLDINGS

The PAVE Infrastructure Development ETF's Top-10 holdings can be found on Global X ETF website and equate to roughly 30% of what I would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of 101 companies.

PAVE has ~$2.3 billion in assets, so even a 3.2% weight of #1 holding Deere (DE) results in a $80.5 million stake. Many investors would consider Deere and odd choice for an infrastructure ETF considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture. However, DE operates in three segments - one of which is its Construction & Forestry Segment. This segment manufactures machines for earth moving, road building, graders, excavators, material handling, crushers and screeners, and asphalt pavers. DE is up 178% over the past year yet has an estimated forward P/E of only 23.3x.

The #2 holding with a 3.0% weight is motion control systems specialist Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH), which operates a Diversified Industrial segment that provides sealing, shielding, vibration, and thermal solutions as well as filters, noise abatement, and contaminate removal systems for water, air, fuel, oil, and other liquids. PH is also up 170%+ over the past year, has a forward P/E=22.4x, and yields 1.1%.

The Eaton Corp. (ETN) is the #3 holding and has 3.0% weight within the portfolio. Eaton pays a $3.04 annual dividend, yields 2.2%, and has a forward P/E=24.9x. The company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the American Jobs Plan's investments into Clean Tech and Clean Energy.

The #4, #5, and #10 holdings are railroad companies Norfolk Southern (NSC), Kansas City Southern (KSU), and CSX Corp. (CSX). Along with #12 holding Union Pacific (UNP), these four holdings alone equate to ~11.5% of the entire portfolio. Obviously, this ETF is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel, rock, asphalt, lumber, steel, and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads, bridges, buildings, and energy and water systems as detailed in the AJP. These railroads will also benefit from ""opening up"" and a generally stronger economy

Some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the Biden administration and big-pharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and, as a result, from general expectations that the U.S. economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the 2H of the year. Meantime, Canadian Pacific (CP) recently offered to buy KSU for $25 billion, which has added some ""merger mania"" to the sector.

Surprisingly, the fund does not hold Caterpillar (CAT). CAT is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill. But considering that stock has doubled over the past year, perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued. But with a forward P/E=28.3x and a 1.8% yield, CAT seems to be an odd omission in my opinion.

Looking through the rest of the portfolio (see the full list of holdings here), we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials (steel, aluminum, copper, lumber, asphalt, filters, etc.) needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation, electrical, utility, and water infrastructure.

PERFORMANCE

PAVE ETF wins by a considerable margin over IFRA on a NAV basis and neither ETF pays that much in the way of income (0.64% and 1.4%, respectively). PAVE is ~9x the size of IFRA, which has ~$250 million in AUM.

Over a shorter time-frame that encompasses the ""year-of-covid-19"" and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get Americans back to work with good-paying jobs got serious, PAVE has also out-performed the IFRA ETF by a significant margin.

FUND BASICS

These metrics all come from the Global X PAVE ETF Webpage:

Expense Ratio: 0.47%
AUM: $2.3 billion
P/E Ratio: 32.2x
Forward P/E Ratio: 21.9x
Price-to-Book: 3.6x
30-day SEC-yield: 0.64%
Roughly 87% of the fund is invested in the Industrials and Materials sectors.

RISKS

Considering the strong rally the PAVE ETF has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill, much has already been built into the price. That said, note the fund is not over-weight any high-flying clean-energy names and, despite the growth of some of these stocks, many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels - see the forward P/E's of some of the top holding discussed earlier.

The biggest risk is getting a substantial the American Jobs Plan through Congress. It should get through the Democratically controlled House in roughly the same shape as presented. As we learned with the American Rescue Plan, despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the Democratic Party, they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesn't get through the very narrowly controlled Senate, it won't matter what they pass in the House. Much is likely to depend on what Senator Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) decides he will support as if history is any indication, the AJP will get zero Republicans votes, so the Democrats must get all 50-votes so that Vice President Harris can break the tie.

I believe the Democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by Navigator recently found broad bi-partisan support (over 80%) for an infrastructure bill by American voters.

TLDR: Summary & Conclusion

For those investors that don't typically invest in the infrastructure sector (myself included) but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the American Jobs Plan, the PAVE ETF seems like an excellent choice. The portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the build-out of U.S. infrastructure. PAVE is a BUY.","['NSC', 'CSX', 'UNP', 'PH', 'DE', 'KSU', 'PGR', 'ETN']"

Apes, I have excellent news. Today, I woke up (with only a half chub) and thought to myself “I’m gonna be super productive today and get a ton of work done.” Then, my ADHD medicine kicked in and I went down another GME rabbit hole. Here is the product of that (I will warn you, this is long):

I have done a lot of digging and have found some extraordinary similarities from last year’s annual meeting of stockholders to this one and why it and the months leading up to it should be HUGE for GME. This is not a technical analysis, this is pure DD. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Just a note: you can find all of these documents simply by searching “Gamestop Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders” on Google, I just picked out the important parts to make it easier.

**History**

I am first going to start with GME’s share price as of April 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/8vdfrd67c0r61.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=48c7b8413ba4ab2e925d7332c6e5967a13b990fc

&#x200B;

As you can see, on April 3rd, 2020, GME’s price bottomed to under $2. This was due to Covid absolutely crushing the company and shorters seeking to hit the “bankruptcy jackpot.” However, on April 3rd and the next few days, we see the price of GME almost triple all the way up to $6. Why was this? Some of you may remember Michael Burry announced his GME position in April 2020. Well, that’s not what caused this rise as Burry announced his stake on Friday the 10th, which caused a rise on Monday the 13th:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2nex5908c0r61.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=de67e9bdd2d979c91dc9bb43bc53b2a12da68ae9

So if it wasn’t Michael Burry’s announcement of his position, then what was it? Was it the announcement of the annual shareholder’s meeting? Nope, that was announced in late April as well:

https://preview.redd.it/ng9w1hn8c0r61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=80752e0a42df99f79379699efda585b273c938b3

&#x200B;

So, if it wasn’t either of those things, then what was it? The drastic rise in GME starting April 3rd, 2020 (which seems pathetic compared to today’s price action) was due to a group of activist investors, Hestia Capital, who owned 7.5% of GME at the time announcing that they would be nominating new members of the board at the shareholders meeting. When was this letter released? April 3rd, 2020:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y9fc9ul9c0r61.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=2203bb2a004f5510f8d37d0e0415f26a165233b2

Why is this significant? Well, for some reason it was pretty well known that GME’s short interest was over 100% at this time (still blows my mind that more people didn’t pounce on this at the time, myself included). Again, this was because Covid was destroying GME and shorts were looking to get the “bankruptcy jackpot.” I believe that this is when shorts were deploying massive amounts of naked shorts. Their reasoning was that if they pushed GME into bankruptcy, they wouldn’t have to repay the naked shorts because the company wouldn’t exist anymore (this is just a theory but it seems reasonable considering what’s happened today). Shorts took a calculated risk that they thought would pay off. Their reasoning was that at the best they hit the bankruptcy jackpot and at the worst they stock goes up a little and they take a slight loss due to the naked shorts (boy were they wrong on that one). Well, their plan almost worked. They got it down to under $3. Then, this statement came out. Why is that statement significant? Well, this letter explicitly stated that GME has high short interest and that in order to vote, shareholders need to recall their shares from anyone who has them on loan before the date of April 20, 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/pc0t84fac0r61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=44b6abff32b7961952a48798d464c491f3c7a445

&#x200B;

Look back at the GME chart that I posted at the top of this. BOOM. This company announces that and people start recalling their shares, forcing some shorts to cover. GME’s massive short interest at this time was already well known:

https://preview.redd.it/p0046h2bc0r61.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffee6642fffdc657bb343467eff365a777f9bb84

&#x200B;

From that point on, GME's price never even got close to that $3 range again:

https://preview.redd.it/b5gn9tubc0r61.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73405eb69dce6967d5a7a95684f6fcd1e1fb484

&#x200B;

I couldn’t include the rest of the chart because it makes these moves seem insignificant because of GME’s massive price today. This is where the shorts should’ve thrown in the towel and taken the loss, but they didn’t. They kept shorting GME and, as we all know, the short interest eventually hit 140% and the January events happened. And know we’re here, exactly 1 year later to the tee. The rest of this post will be going over the similarities of this period last year to today and my thoughts on what might happen.

**Similarities**

So, as stated above, GME’s price rose so rapidly on April 3rd because of that proxy statement urging shareholders to recall their shares. This, which was simply an urging, not a full recall, lead to an almost 3x increase in price in just a few days. Imagine if GME does a forced recall of the shares this time around: BOOM.

The first similarity is the presence of activist investors trying to make a fundamental change to GME as a company. The 2020 activist investor that I mentioned above, Hestia Capital, was what Ryan Cohen currently is. From the proxy statement, we can see that Hestia was actively trying to replace people on the GME board of directors for their inaction and ineffectiveness:

https://preview.redd.it/adj3y4edc0r61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcaae3d58dffe33c36eb3ff6b9c02c1544db95ce

https://preview.redd.it/yzjcp6edc0r61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=3081f2c2f5034871461197e61f6b6e0e1855e1c0

https://preview.redd.it/desngdedc0r61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66cfdecd99b8f97de088f16ab4dcab54aad716b

&#x200B;

Also, note that the whole point of this proxy letter was Hestia announcing that they are nominating people to the board for the 2020 meeting and that shareholders need to vote. Does this feel any similar to Cohen getting on the board, ousting the C.F.O., and bringing on Chewey and Amazon execs?

Throughout the letter, Hestia documents the reasons for their desire to change the board and documents a history of the events leading up to it. This is far too much information to screenshot, but I encourage you to read it for yourself: [https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/17596/html) (Search “reasons for the solicitation” and “background of the solicitation” within the document to find these points).

To recap, we have the presence of an activist investor trying to shake up the board of GME, GME having a massive short interest, naked/abusive shorting activity, the annual shareholders meeting being in June (last year it was June 12th, this year it is June 11th), and an activist investor trying to change the fundamental direction of the company. All of this went down in April and was related to the shareholders meeting in June.

Sounds pretty similar to today right? But what’s the difference? Ryan Cohen is a much stronger activist investor, seems to have more power in the company, has a clearer vision than Hestia, and is making changes more aggressively. Another difference is obviously GME’s price, media coverage, and volume. The short squeeze has made GME a hot media topic, the price is multiples higher than it was a year ago (almost 200x), and the volume (though lower recently) is still MUCH higher than it was one year ago (see any GME chart and compare the volume). But there’s one more difference that is crucial. There is an odd phenomenon in GME today. A strange primate whose scientific name is hominoidea, whose hands are strong as diamonds, and whose wives have endless boyfriends. Yes, I am talking about apes. The uncanny ability of apes to buy and hold throughout any storm has created a sort of wall of support on GME that makes it very hard for shorts to kill the price. Combine that with another strange creature, whose scientific name is Cetacea, who has deep pockets and a symbiotic relationship with hominoidea. This is our whale. This symbiotic relationship means that the shorts are toast (I’m not even joking here, apes have created a wall of support, we have power). Combine all of this with the abusive shorting, failure to deliver cycle, statutory leverage ratio relief not being extended, and new DTCC/SEC regulations on abusive shorting and you have a recipe for tendies.

**The future**

So, I broke down the past, showed you the similarities, and talked about the present. Now what? Well, here are my thoughts on how the potential GME shareholder’s meeting and the months leading up to it could affect the stock:

First, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank.

I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the shorts to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their C.F.O.

The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC rules, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. This year’s meeting is June 12th or 11th (not sure which but it’s one of those).

Let's use June 11 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 12. Moreover, the tenure of the current C.E.O. also lines up with that date. The current C.E.O. is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company until a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly be waiting until that date to announce Cohen as the C.E.O. (or at the very least to announce that the current C.E.O. is parting ways with the company). Remember when this happened to the C.F.O in February (the price returned from the dead), just imagine how much bigger the rise would be if this announcement was for the C.E.O.

Now, turn your attention back to everything I said above about last year. Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions, or maybe someone with a significant stake in GME (oh Idk maybe Cohen whose stake is almost double what Hestia’s was) could submit a proxy statement similar to Hestia’s which encourages shareholders to recall their shares so they can vote. Or, maybe GME will announce a forced recall for the purposes of voting (GME already acknowledged in their SEC filing that they are aware that their stock still has very high short interest). Maybe this explains why the conference call was so bland: the C.E.O. knows that he’s on the outs and was instructed by the board to give a bare-bones call so they can announce the juicy stuff later when he’s out. OR, maybe there will be more announcements about more board members coming on similar to the recent announcement of the Chewey and Amazon execs. Either way, if any of these announcements require a vote and shares are forcibly recalled or if it is recommended that shareholders recall their shares, then maybe we will see something similar to last year.

That date (April 15th) is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point. It's also significant that GME has made leadership announcements in each of the past few months (C.F.O. in February, Amazon + Chewey Execs in March), and that it would make sense for another announcement to come in April especially considering last year's activity in April regarding leadership and where Cohen is currently trying to take the company.

As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on market makers for failing to deliver shares. This is again just conjecture did research similar to this and came to the conclusion that April 16th would be a crucial day, so he is waiting til then to exercise to put more pressure on the failure to delivers. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account.

Finally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and Cohen are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, Cohen loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said ""I love your shorts."" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know Cohen is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (Cohen included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to ""warn"" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely.

Yeah I know that was long, rabbit holes will do that to ya.

**TL;DR**

One year ago to the tee, GME’s stock rose on the announcement that an activist investor was having a vote and they recommended shareholders to recall their shares. The short interest was over 100%. The activist investor sought to shakeup management and change the direction of GME. Fast forward to today (exactly 1 year later), and we have an activist investor changing up the company. If GME does a share recall ahead of this meeting or if Cohen releases a proxy statement encouraging shareholders to recall their shares, we could very well see a meteoric rise similar to last year at this time. GME has not provided much information on that meeting, so, similar to last year, updates could come in the month of April. We know that any announcement about leadership changes makes the stock rise.

Both China and the US will start to reduce their own critical industries' reliance on components from the other side, so that they can avoid being held hostage by the other side using these supply chain choke points as geopolitical bargaining stakes (see how the ban of [Qualcomm chips](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242664/us-uk-china-smartphone-zte-security-risk-sanctions) and [Google Android OS](https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-ban) disrupted ZTE and Huawei's global smartphone businesses respectively). This is evidenced by China's ""[Made in China 2025 ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade)"" plan and the US's ongoing [plan](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/efforts-to-bring-chip-manufacturing-to-us-soil-will-continue-in-2021/) to bring chip manufacturing back to US soil.

Despite the growing anti-globalization trend in critical supply chains, there is still a desire for US automotive companies to penetrate the Chinese market and also a similar desire for Chinese automakers to expand beyond their domestic market into global markets. 

For emerging technologies like connected and autonomous vehicles, there will still be a need for a standardized vehicle base operating system (hypervisor) and data abstraction layer for future software-defined vehicles in order for a software and app ecosystem to flourish across different vehicle makes from various automakers. A standard vehicle base os is also crucial in ensuring that these vehicles remain interoperable across different countries with different legal safety requirements, cloud services, V2X infrastructure and media apps ecosystems, without requiring changes to their physical hardware when scaling across different markets.

It is unlikely that this standard interoperability layer will come from the US or China due to their reluctance to incorporate such a critical component from the other side in their emerging tech products due to geopolitical and security concerns. Being a Canadian company, Blackberry has the best chance at global dominance with their [QNX hypervisor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf3r7c/qnx_hypervisor_will_be_in_all_future_connected/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [IVY data platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf2t5a/blackberry_qnx_ivy_might_be_the_next_android/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

If you listen to this [discussion](https://youtu.be/nRwdDnrc7qI), you will understand all these talks are not mere hype, but actual plans to be executed. John Wall, SVP of Blackberry Technology Solutions, also mentioned that they will likely partner with a major Chinese cloud provider (Alibaba cloud, Huawei cloud, Tencent cloud, Baidu AI cloud etc.) very soon, similar to the Blackberry-AWS IVY partnership. This shows how well-positioned Blackberry is at being the interoperability layer for connected and autonomous vehicles in a world where there is increasing decoupling between the US and China tech ecosystems.

Edit:

I see some complaints that my viewpoint is not substantiated enough, so here's some elaboration:

The US-China decoupling will only happen for intermediate goods (components that are used in the production of final goods that will be purchased by end consumers). For example, instead of using the US's Android OS, Huawei phones are now using their own HongMeng OS. Supply chain decoupling does not imply the ban of final goods from China (Huawei phones) in the US. You can still [buy](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/despite-ban-you-can-still-buy-huawei-phones-in-the-us-heres-how/) Huawei phones in the US, just that not many people would want to buy them due to the lack of Google Mobile Services and Google Play store for these Huawei phones (cannot download apps easily). This affects Huawei's sale in the US.

Now for connected and autonomous vehicles which does not yet have any dominant app ecosystems like Android or iOS yet. This time, with the Chinese having the capability to influence the growth of an emerging tech sector, do you think the Chinese will support an American OS + platform + app ecosystem and risk getting banned again and losing their global sales?

Of course, China can build their own OS + platform + app ecosystem but it is unlikely to gain traction beyond their domestic market because they lack the deep technical capability/maturity (HongMeng OS turned out to be just an Android clone) or the influence to convince app developers outside China to develop apps for them. 

I think you might have underestimated the importance of standards and abstractions in the tech industry.
>The world runs windows on AMD and Intel

This only works precisely because both AMD and Intel chips use the x86-64 Instruction Set Architecture, where programs are compiled to the same assembly code which is interoperable across Intel and AMD chips. There is a reason you cannot run a desktop software on an Android smartphone with a Qualcomm chip because smartphones use the ARM architecture. Again, in the smartphone world, Android can run on Qualcomm Snapdragon, Huawei's Kirin, Samsung's Exynos chips, precisely because all these chips use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture. (ARM was last valued to be $40 billion btw)

Now, such interoperability layer (analogous to x86-64 for desktop CPUs and ARM for smartphone CPUs) has not existed  for the connected and autonomous vehicle yet. My main focus in this article is to put forward my view that this interoperability layer is unlikely to come from any American or Chinese companies because each of them will not accept any proposed standards from the other side. It has to come from a third party (not necessarily Canada, can be any other countries). But ruling out Chinese and American tech companies, Blackberry is the only frontrunner left capable of driving this industry standard forward.
