# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

I just decided to download the app on IOS and it blew my mind because it put everything in one place.

It lets you add a list of your favourite tickers so you can see them all on the same page in real time.

After you create a list by adding your favourite stocks you can click on “list details” and there is even a customizable table where you can decide which details you want to see for your stocks (52 week high, day high, day low, volume, avg volume etc).

It also lists upcoming earnings reports for your favourite stocks.

And if you scroll down on any page it lists news articles related to the stocks on your list as well.

Now, instead of doing frequent searches for all the stocks I’m following to get updates I can just sit back and let it all roll in (I’m still going to cross reference for a while because I don’t know how accurate they are).

Summary:

\- Most of the article is about VW (maybe sponsored by VW? :-) )

\- VW become the #1 EV maker in EU last year

\----EV cars sales in EU: Dec 2019: TSLA: 110K , VW 46K;  Dec 2020: TSLA: 96K, VW: 174K

\- VW CEO (Diess) using the same strategy as Musk (creating media hype, ""power day"" similar to ""battery day, etc), stock has gone up 80% ytd, meme stock potential

\- This year, VW plans to deliver 1 million plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and Diess aims to surpass Tesla in EV sales no later than 2025. Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.

\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).

\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.

\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years

\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)

\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models

\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)

\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from ""legacy"" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves

\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think ""only EV after year xxxx"" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider

&#x200B;

Opinion:

\- would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is one of the main thing that TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with

\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)

&#x200B;

What do you think?

I thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour.

PS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.

EDIT 1: Just for the heck of it, I just bought a couple of TSLA at 655.

Thing is, Tesla is in a near-impossible phase right now of developing highly innovative manufacturing and assembly plants that are vertically integrated. If they can get to the stage where this is copy & paste, then the exponential growth of their company will be explosive. The vast majority of companies fail at this, but Tesla has everything available to them to make it happen. 

I don't know the specifics, but I know Sandy Munro (who specializes in specifically this) said that new startup EV manufacturers have a better shot at competing than the legacy ICE ones. He referenced having to retrofit factories and completely swap out their entire supply chain as issues that will cause bankruptcies and mergers. Not entirely sure how the worldwide battery shortage would fit into all of this...

I still think this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. There was a recent survey done here in Canada where they found more than 70% of Canadians planned on buying an EV as their next car. And 83% of that 70% wanted specifically a Tesla. People want Tesla's. They don't want VW EVs. The Mach-E is imo the only good competitor on the market rn.","['TSLA', 'ICE']"

Excerpt:

> A gap or spread has opened up between the price of Volkswagen AG’s ordinary shares (VOW), now at €299—equivalent to around $354—and its preference shares (VOW3), at €225. The latter aren’t conventional, debtlike preference shares; they are identical to the ordinary shares except that they don’t carry voting rights. In the U.S., there would be two different share classes.

> Infamously, the spread last ballooned in 2008, when Porsche SE tried to take over VW. That saga, by way of a short squeeze that briefly made VW the world’s most valuable company, ended with VW taking over Porsche’s car-making operation, Porsche AG, leaving behind an investment company, Porsche SE (PAH3), with roughly 53% of VW’s ordinary shares and lots of lawsuits. Since that drama, VW’s ordinary and preference shares have rarely traded out of line.

> Porsche SE isn’t a suspect this time round. The company says its stake in VW hasn’t changed in recent weeks, and it is hard to see why it would risk more legal challenges.

> Instead, brokers are pointing the finger at inexperienced U.S. investors. They appear to be buying VW ordinary shares without realizing the confusingly named preference shares offer the same for less.

In short, it looks like a lot of big pension funds sold a lot of stocks to buy bonds as their quarterly rebalancing. This explains why the Yields actually went down a lot while the rest of the market as a whole was tanking.


But if you noticed, one thing did well: FAANG. Why? because analysts expect the yields going down to help the large cap growth stocks.



But i think once the large funds are done rebalancing, people will buy back into the market for sure with the low yields, and we should see growth doing better.

mc9dbs,,stocks,post,1616601647,"Change My Mind - $MSFT is a better growth play that $AAPLIf I'm investing for retirement, let's say 40 years out, I'm betting on Microsoft more than Apple.

Microsoft has a monopoly over the business world and has a subscription-based business model with products that are timeless (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations have been used for centuries if not millenniums and we will continue to use these methods of communication for centuries more. PLUS the shift to cloud is driving demand for their cloud offering Azure (50% growth in one year). It's intelligent cloud segment revenues grew 23%+ a year and quickly gaining market share. Ever since they pivoted to SaaS, their revenue and earnings have been stable and increasing so consistently - it's beautiful. Businesses will always choose Microsoft!

Apple relies more heavily on consumer products and its total revenue and earnings haven't grown that much since 2015. What’s next after the iPhone? Car? Glasses? We're betting on them innovating in a massive way. But can they replicate the vision and innovation of Steve Jobs? Many men and women have tried... Only person doing it right now is Elon Musk. But that's besides the point.

Check this out - financials support Microsoft as a better growth company than Apple.

2015 to 2020 Revenue (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - $93.6B to $153B (+64.5% - $59.4B growth) $AAPL - $233.7 to $294B (+25.8% - $60.3B growth)

2015 to 2020 EBITDA (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - $33.6B to $71.7B (+113% - $38.1B growth) $AAPL - $77.9B to $85.1B (+9.2% - $10.5B growth)

2015 to 2020 Operating Profit Margin (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - 19.4% to 33.4% (+72%)
$AAPL - 30.2% to 21.7% (-28%)

Microsoft is a cash cow and sales and profits are increasing at double digit rates. Apple is even more of a cash cow but sales and profits are slowing. Microsoft has a new core offering (Azure). Apple does not (yet). Numbers don't lie. Microsoft is a better growth play than Apple.","['AAPL', 'MSFT']"

mc9dbs,gs2j5c0,stocks,comment,1616606069,"Microsoft lost a lot of developer mindshare in the 2010s.

Meaning that the people who write software have long ago switched from the Microsoft platform, developer tools and stacks.

Most modern software development (at scale) is being done with Java and Javascript.  AWS is pretty dominant in cloud hosting.  

A lot of micro services architectures leveraging Docker and open source stacks running on linux.

A lot of the workstations used by developers are latest and greatest Apple MacBook Pro machines.

This is just my “man on the ground” perspective.

I’m sure Microsoft has a lot of “cash cow” products that they continue to charge for but I don’t really see it as a “growth” company that can innovate.  

Once developers have switched their workstation platforms and have gone full open source as far as the platform they deploy their software to, you’ve lost innovation and control of the future.  Like it or not, Microsoft Windows is not going to be the operating system that powers cloud platforms of the future.  

It’s not really about Apple versus Microsoft. It’s about open-source versus licensed platforms and developer mindshare.  

Through extremely disingenuous business practices, Microsoft has managed to alienate a huge share of the developer population. They will never use Microsoft platforms or tools again.  They treat any mention of Microsoft tools, stacks or platforms with suspicion.  They know that with Microsoft there is always a catch. 

A huge problem that Microsoft has is that of licensing software at scale.  You need to license every running instance of Microsoft software.  This makes it impossible to scale up because every computing unit that you add you have to pay a license for to Microsoft.  Modern software has to scale up and out.  This just becomes impossible from a licensing perspective with Microsoft. It’s much better to go with a free open source stack.

Microsoft has licensing terms built into their developer tools that can rob you blind.  They also force you to keep using their platform by locking you into their ecosystem from the time you have a MVP. (Minimum Viable Product)  This is built-in to the software lifecycle when you use Microsoft development tools.  Microsoft also creates artificial problems and gaps for which you need to buy another Microsoft product.  

They do this purposely in order to get more of your money.  It is though they have perfected the art of capturing your wealth.  

This has driven many developers over a tipping point where they never want to have anything to do with any Microsoft product or platform in the future. Ever again.

That’s a terrible reputation to have as a business with your core audience.  

Ultimately a successful software business (SaaS, platform, tools) is built on developer mind share.  Ensuring that developers use your offerings to build new software. 

That is not happening with Microsoft. There is a lot of old software that was built using Microsoft tools but nothing new.

I’d say long-term bet against Microsoft.  Bet on amazon AWS.  Bet on Atlassian.  Bet on IntelliJ.  Bet on Mirantis / Docker.  

Bet on companies offering IaaS to open source software scalable stacks and software architectures.","['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']"

* Comparable store sales increased 6.5%;
* Net sales were $2.122 billion compared to $2.194 billion in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, reflecting an operating environment that included a 12% decrease in the store base due to the Company’s strategic de-densification efforts and a reduction of approximately 27% in European store operating days during the quarter as a result of temporary store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
* Global E-Commerce sales (included in comparable store sales) increased 175% and represented 34% of net sales in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter versus 12% of net sales in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter;
* Gross margin was 21.1%, a decline of 610 basis points compared to the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, reflecting an expected mix shift toward lower margin console sales in response to the launch of generation 9 consoles, increased freight and credit card fees associated with the shift to E-Commerce sales, and a broader promotional stance;
* Selling, general and administrative expenses were $419.1 million, a decline of $92.6 million, or 18%, from $511.7 million in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, driven by the Company’s cost optimization initiatives;
* Income tax expense was a benefit of $69.7 million due to a change in the tax status of certain foreign entities, and the impact of the CARES Act, including tax benefits associated with the availability of a five-year carryback period for certain current year tax losses (which compares to income tax expense of $43.8 million in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter), and;
* Net income was $80.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share on 67.8 million shares outstanding and included a $1.03 per share tax benefit as described above, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.32 in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.   Adjusted net income was $90.7 million or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $83.8 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter.",['DE']

We then chose to employ a managed relational database; mainly due to the more inexpensive pricing of Amazon RDS compared to DO's managed DB offering, we've rolled out our production at AWS. AWS has a vast amount of features but the user interface is a real pain in the beginning.

As other already said the cloud space is very competitive. DO has a good offer that is painless to set up first, the company makes a good overall appearance as a friendly business partner, compared to behemoth/incumbent AWS, and the pricing is attractive.

Something else to consider: we've applied for the Amazon founder's program, where they give startups free credit (depending on the tier, either a lot of credits for 12 months or a smaller amount for 24 months). So for the first year AWS hasn't cost us a penny. I guess this is also a disadvantage of DO, as AWS locks in new companies this way.

Still we are using DO for internal development, as we don't want to rely on just one cloud, and if there is any catastrophic event on the side of AWS we'd be prepared to switch production to DO instantly.

From an investor's perspective I'd have a hard time judging the valuation of DO. Probably revenue and earnings growth over the last years are something to look at. DO has been around for a while, but if it's a big growth case and the $ 5B valuation is reasonable, I don't know.",['AMZN']

mbo981,,stocks,post,1616532009,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 23, 2021Stocks pulled back Tuesday, extending the recent bout of volatility, as market participants considered commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Moreover, a rise in COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted a new lockdown in Germany. 

Market participants closely monitored remarks from both Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.”

While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market remains volatile, with Treasury yields rising once again in anticipation of strong economic recovery and inflationary fears that could cause the Fed to reign back sooner-than-expected. We think the fear is overblown, given the Fed’s consistency in this stance. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Early today, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

It’s absolutely outrageous that I’m about to lose all my money on a god damn wrestling stock but here we are...

1:  NFT plays have been going absolutely parabolic.  With the decades of original content the WWE has there is no way they won’t capitalize on this and create their own version of NBA top shot.  It’s only a matter of time and I expect them to strike sooner rather than later.

2:  if you don’t like it as an NFT play it is a reopening play.  Wrestlemania, their largest event of the year takes place in 3 weeks  at Raymond James stadium and they have already stated they are hoping to have the largest attendance for a US event since the pandemic began.  

3.  We got a 20% short float and tons of money coming in from a billion dollar tv deal with Fox and the recent news that peacock purchased the rights to the WWE network.

I have my other financial bases covered (no debt, fully funded emergency fund). Currently, I'm just tossing money each month into the savings account for the future downpayment -- but I'd like to see if I can get some kind of better return from the market instead.

Is it too risky to put it all in VTI or other index funds? Is it not risky enough to warrant decent growth? I'm looking to cash it all out in about a year or so, so I'm interested in some measure of risk to possibly gain some nice rewards as I continually fund it throughout the year. I imagine I can probably save $60-80k on my own over the next year, but hoping maybe the market can add something significant to that along the way.

Or since it's important life money (not exactly ""play"" money), should I just use a high yield savings account instead and keep risk as low as possible?",

mc71py,,stocks,post,1616595988,"Self-driving truck startup TuSimple files to go publicTuSimple, the self-driving truck company that is backed by a diverse consortium of strategic investors, including Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck business The Traton Group, Navistar, Goodyear, and freight company U.S. Xpress, filed Tuesday for an initial public offering.

TuSimple is taking the traditional path to going public, a departure from the recent trend — particularly among electric and autonomous vehicle startups — to merge with a special purpose acquisition companies.

The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, according to the regulatory filing. TuSimple intends to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “TSP.” Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the proposed offering.

According to the company’s S-1, which was filed Tuesday, TuSimple has primarily financed its operations through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and loans from stockholders. The company’s principal sources of liquidity were $310.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, exclusive of restricted cash of $1.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks as well as certificates of deposit.

The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 million in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier.

The company’s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.

TuSimple, which was founded in 2015,  was one of the first autonomous trucking startups to emerge in what has become a small, yet bustling industry that now includes Aurora, Embark, Kodiak and Waymo. While TuSimple’s founding team and its earliest backers Sina and Composite Capital are from China, a chunk of its operations are in the United States, including its global headquarters in San Diego. TuSimple also operates an engineering center and truck depot in Tucson and more recently set up a facility in Texas to support its autonomous trips —always with a human safety operator behind the wheel. TuSimple also has operations in Beijing and Shanghai.

Despite its U.S. operations and U.S. partners, its shares are largely held by Chinese investors, the S-1 prospectus shows. The company’s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group’s The Traton Group. TuSimple’s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.

The Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.

mc71py,gs26982,stocks,comment,1616600660,"In the truck industry and haven't heard of these guys, but would definitely be very very wary.

Just looking at their total revenue for last year- your average truck dealership can make that kind of money off of one deal, selling to one fleet or municipality. Your average new semi can run between $100k and $250k USD, and electric vehicles cost even more. A few million dollars revenue is small in this industry. If that revenue was from truck orders, that could be just 6 or 7 trucks. That's microscopic in this industry.

With any commercial truck, an extremely important factor is the parts and service network. Manufacturers like freightliner and mack have parts and service networks with trained technicians in every city and town in the country. It doesn't matter where your truck breaks down, you can tow it 50 miles and get it fixed. With a brand new manufacturer, especially with custom technology, that gets wayyyy harder. The shops won't have trained techs, and won't have parts in stock to take care of you. Giants like Tesla face this hurdle, I have no idea how TuSimple will tackle it.

Additionally, important components like microchips are super limited right now. A self driving truck is going to have more electrical component and chip needs than most, and they won't have the buying power and supply chains of huge companies like Daimler, and Daimler is still having supply chain issues.

If TuSimple is just making software for existing trucks, great. If it's making its own trucks, I don't see how it can possibly compete in the US. Maybe in Europe where the market is much more segmented, but in the US it's a small handful of monoliths.

If you want to invest in automated trucking, invest in Daimler. They own freightliner and western star, controlling the lion's share of the US trucking industry, and they were automating trucking before even Tesla.

Teradyne ,$TER tests nearly 50% of all semiconductors worldwide.

The semi-conductor industry should grow well over the next three years, led by demand for 5G phones, Data Centers, AI and Auto. Besides, the current chip shortage has created pent up demand which should be fulfilled in 2021-2022.

$TER was particularly adept in managing COVID-19, and had an exceptional 2020, growing revenues 36% and Net Income 68%. $TER's strength is in managing complexity and this should enable it increase market share.

From their earnings call. ""Another complexity driver is 5G. And these high tier phones are early adopters of the extra silicon needed to enable these features. Less than 250 million phones are expected to be 5G-enabled in 2020 and only a fraction of those will support millimeter wave communication. **So despite the bump in 2020, we are still in the very early stages of 5G adoption.""**

$TER has a robotics division, which is much smaller but was growing much faster than the company, before COVID ground everything to a standstill. I believe robotics will lead growth in the years ahead.

CEO Jagiela has an optimistic outlook for the unit saying, ""Among other things, AutoGuide adoption by key logistics, e-commerce, retail, and automotive customers in 2021 will set the stage for multiple years of double-digit growth.""

**Investment -** Longer term, I plan to hold onto my shares in the retirement account. $TER grew revenues at an average of 9% and income about 11% in the last 10 years, but going forward, I expect more growth to kick in from robotics and expect revenues to grow about 11% and Earnings about 14%. $TER should earn about $7.50 in 2023. At a PE of 24 that’s $180 , returning 16% per year.

**Trading** \- There is a trading opportunity here. After peaking at 148 in February, $TER dropped a whopping 45 points before finding support at 103, around its 200DMA (March 8th). Since then, it’s been steadily moving upwards with supports at 107-108, and 111-112.

mbjr24,,stocks,post,1616520059,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine?Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. 

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. 

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud** 

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! 

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. 

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. 

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. 

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends and has netted shareholders billions. 

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. 

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. 

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.","['CRM', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'FB', 'NI', 'NFLX']"

mc9wo6,,stocks,post,1616603001,"Broker ResearchHello Everyone! First post on this sub, but I have learned a lot and wanted to share some research. Sorry ahead of time if I used the wrong flair just let me know!

Anyways, I started investing in 2017 on Robinhood. I like many others have been understandably upset with recent events surrounding the brokerage. After doing some research and reading through a lot of threads I never came up with a good alternative. I opened a Fidelity account as was suggested by many people; however, as someone who's only ever used RH I found their interface to be confusing and outdated. I tried to use the Spire app, but it would never let me log in. I kept looking, Webull seemed like a logical option since its interface is similar to that of RH. The issue with Webull is its financial position is similar to that of RH and would/has restricted trading. Then I logged into my Ally bank account to check on some deposits and noticed they have self-directed trading accounts among their options. After doing some research I decided to open an account and test it out and let me tell you I am happy I did. I've used ally for my banking needs for a little over a year now and never had any issues. 

Do your own research, but as someone who's been wondering where to go after RH this is it. I can access all my accounts from one App. The app is easy to use and actually works. The website is also easy to use gives you the data you need and access to the advanced data and graphs if you want that too. You can app for margins and options trading, and they charge competitive rates for both. If anyone has questions I will be happy to help how I can.

mbrx3u,gs0j9z9,stocks,comment,1616560225,"At work I regularly interact with supercomputers, and most of the architectures I work on are Intel-based. And they have been for about a decade. I strongly doubt that will be changing anytime soon, and bigger and better supercomputers are always in demand for numerical purposes. With a progressive US leadership (at least relative to the previous administration), I expect a large chunk of funding will go into tech-reliant sciences and research (e.g., climate research, which can require massive computational resources). In my field I've never encountered any supercomputing architecture that utilizes AMD products (pretty much all Intel/Cray), although I am aware that they do exist. To that end and given its pricing history, I view(ed) INTC as relatively undervalued against the hot exuberance of its oft-mentioned tech competitors like AMD and NVDA. My view on the AMD v INTC thing is simple: 

- AMD is smaller and has more potential to grow, but I think it is inherently a riskier investment *right now*. If you're a more value-oriented investor, then you probably want nothing to do with the relatively adrenal AMD right now (or most tech in general, for that matter). Still, AMD is probably the better spot if you are betting on gaming industry growth. And as far as current tech valuations go, I feel there are far more dangerous bets out there.
- INTC is larger and more stable, but it has enjoyed far less growth over the last 1/3/5 years compared to AMD. It has more diverse offerings and probably has better name recognition across all age demographics, likely giving them an edge up on consumers who have no want for gaming-oriented or otherwise tech-advanced systems but still need something to do taxes on (boomers). this is clearly the *safer* bet, but perhaps not as sexy and likely won't end in a luxurious return.","['PGR', 'NVDA', 'INTC', 'AMD', 'ED']"

I think this will be an interesting and good discussion while we are in this dip/ correction now is a good time to look at your portfolio and make some purchases for the long term. I have taken this time to rebalance and change my direction i was going. I definitely went way too speculative/ risky and didnt understand exactly what overvalued was till recently. 

For my low risk i truly believe every individual should have DISNEY in their portfolio. I don't see any downside to it. If a pandemic doesnt completely close the Disney parks for good honestly nothing well. They came out of this pandemic way better than they went into it. My only regret is not buying sooner. But i feel confident they are the type of long hold stock that someday my own kids will be buying and selling. 

Medium risk i went with Draftkings. Sports betting is a major industry and states continue to welcome and legalize betting. I chose medium risk cause if states ever decide to not legalize or somehow feds step in the stock absolutely could tank and never recover. But if this continue to open and legalize this really could 2x-4x over the next year or two. 

Square and Paypal in putting as high risk even though i feel they are lower to medium because of their digital money involvement. If the feds ever crackdown on it... it could tank them. However, i dont think they have much downside besides being a tech stock which as we saw tank hard.

But Consumer Reports said the fact that the in-car videos are saved and transmitted raises privacy issues, and may undermine the benefits of monitoring drivers in the first place.

“If Tesla has the ability to determine if the driver isn’t paying attention, it needs to warn the driver in the moment, like other automakers already do,” Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports’ auto test center, said in the report.

I’m not exactly a baller I’m the investing space.

Cut to the point, I recently came across $25k of totally unexpected cash. I’d like to do SOMETHING with it—preferably turn it into more money if possible.

Discord is a popular app used by millions of gamers for low-latency voice chat and other communication. Due to social distancing measures and the general growth of the video game industry, Discord nearly doubled its userbase and saw revenue spike to $130 million in 2020. It was valued at $7 billion in December, and is reportedly is not yet profitable.

That would seem to leave Microsoft as the last real domestic contender here. It has pre-existing ties to Discord, as you can already link your Xbox account directly to the service; it’s certainly got the money, with $131 billion in total cash as of Dec. 31; and it’s reportedly still in the market for more gaming-focused acquisitions, even after finalizing its purchase of ZeniMax Media earlier this month.

3. The ape and diamond hand thing while possibly annoying, its FUD ( fear, uncertainty, doubt) proof. This, of course, leads to an echo chamber which can be bad but is impenetrable.

It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""

      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

Quickly close out positions for a small profit (5-15%) with a stop limit set right at or right above my buy in price so that no money is actually lost. (buying in at the start of an ascent after looking at charts) 

OR

Set a stop loss right below my buy in price so that if I do lose money it is a very small fraction of my investment. I could then add those losses to my deductions for the next year. As you can write off up to $3k in stock losses, it would seem like a decent approach to take provided you haven't yet lost $3K. 

In the end I would also rather come away with a profit even if it's a small one that would result in short capital gains tax of about 15% of that gain. Afterall, I could always buy back in with a profit whereas if I take a loss and want to buy back in soon after I would encounter a wash sale on my account.

mbnoae,,stocks,post,1616530443,"$FROG DD -- A Necessity to Achieve Fully-Autonomous Driving**JFROG** is in a spot that you rarely ever see: a spot where the market doesn't quite understand what they do. You get the chance to capitalize by understanding.

This is my first real DD post, so I would appreciate feedback and criticism here. I think this company is massively overlooked, and here is why:

**What they do:**

Their main product is **JFrog Artifactory**, a universal repository for software binaries (executable code). It also serves as a mirror repository - it stores local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer **JFrog Xray**, which scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities. **JFrog Pipelines** then puts the pieces together, automating the ""building"" of the software. And the last piece is **JFrog Distribution,** which packages up the finished software package and delivers it to its destination (a piece of hardware, like your car, phone, watch, computer).

As a metaphor, let's use a pizza restaurant. Artifactory is the walk-in fridge, Xray is the health inspector, Pipelines is the chef, and Distribution is the delivery driver. They all work together seamlessly so that you can get your pizza.

**How this ties in with the huge Autonomous Driving market:**

JFrog already has partnerships with all of the big players in autonomous driving -- Tesla, Lucid, BMW, Daimler, Toyota Motors, etc. They actually have an Automotive DevOps conference every year ([https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/](https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/)). **JFrog is the sole reason** that you no longer have to turn your car off to apply an update, it's just done automatically over the air.

I'm going to fit the earlier framework into the framework of Autonomous Driving-

* Developers want to improve the function of their vehicles, so they write fresh new code or pull in a new open-source software package
* The fresh code they write, along with the open-source packages is stored in Artifactory
* The code and open-source packages pulled in need to be scanned for vulnerabilities - this is done with JFrog Xray
* The open-source parts and the fresh written parts need to be combined into a program and tested for errors - this is done with JFrog Pipelines
* The code then needs to be delivered over-the-air to the vehicles, seamlessly - this is done with JFrog Distribution

As the autonomous driving industry grows to over 3 trillion by 2025, this specific use case is going to **explode.**

**Other big growth catalysts:**

You may have heard of the Solarwinds and FireEye data hacks/leaks, described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack or ""dependency confusion"". The toolset JFrog offers is the best thing on the market to combat this kind of threat, and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security. **JFrog's Xray tool won the DevSecOps solution of the year award in 2020** ([https://devopsdozen.com/](https://devopsdozen.com/)), beating out all the tools available on the market by a significant margin. Analyst firm **GigaOm** also placed JFrog Xray as the best tool available, beating out other options from Gitlab and Micro Focus.

With each one of these huge leaks -- CapitalOne, Equifax, etc -- the development industry sees another huge shift towards security, and JFrog is positioned to scoop up all of this business. Side note: CapitalOne always presents at JFrog conferences now, and they're a huge champion for JFrog now that they're using JFrog's solution to plug their security holes.

**Company Background**

Founded in 2008, when they launched Artifactory. There is only one direct competitor with similar scope - Sonatype Nexus. Artifactory is both better and cheaper. Sonatype began as a plugin for Artifactory that worked similarly to Xray before Xray was released -- when Sonatype tried to encroach on the ""Universal Repo"" market, JFrog struck back with the release of Xray and nearly killed Sonatype. Sonatype still exists, hanging on by a thread, passed around from one venture capital company to another.

I've used both of these products over the years and have worked in environments with and without. I can say with conviction that Artifactory improves developer productivity significantly and secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by 80%+ the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Apple, Twitter, Tesla, Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.** These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have a renewal rate of over 90%, with 133% net revenue retention from existing customers **(FYI, this net retention rate is top 10 in the world among SaaS companies).**

They acquired Shippable in 2019 to turn it into JFrog Pipelines, and the CEO has said that they will be using the funds secured via the IPO to continue to do strategic acquisitions. Other acquisitions include Conan, Trainologic, and CloudMunch.

They went public in late 2020 but it was a bit overshadowed, considering they came out the same day as Snowflake.

**Financials**

Comps here are based on the segment they operate in.

DataDog (DDOG) is another development/delivery infrastructure tool mainly centered around performance monitoring which the teams that use JFrog would typically also use. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello, which are used by most software teams for managing development requirements and agile dev team collaboration. They're not exactly a comparable solution, but I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high-growth software company, it's not surprising that their GAAP earnings are negative. What is surprising is that they're very close to profitability, and even had a quarter of profitability last year.  

   * **FROG: -$0.1861**
   * DDOG: -$0.05
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Market cap:  

   * **FROG: $4.9 B**
   * DDOG: $26.3 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Forward P/E Ratio  

   * **FROG: 615**
   * DDOG: 666
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* No long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* GAAP Margin is 81%
* Revenue growing 44% YOY, will probably accelerate with acquisitions

**Ownership**

65% owned by insiders and institutionsMost of that ownership is insiders -- there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Fund, IZRL) that own it. They just bought another huge block of shares a few days ago.Their final lockup release was 03/15 and there weren't really any huge sales, insider ownership has stayed pretty much the same.

**Summary**

JFrog has a great product, and they are uniquely positioned to corner a growing market (that they invented) which has high barriers to entry. They have proven to be forward-thinking and have fantastic financials.

mboqt4,,stocks,post,1616533342,"BABA - Good Value? Thoughts?I was thinking of doing a more in depth DD on BABA at some point, but wanted some thoughts/input first.

My initial reaction to BABA is that it seems like it's trading at pretty reasonable prices, despite antitrust worries. But I'd like to dig deeper and was wondering what everyone thought? What else should I cover in the financial statements, what other risks are there?

&#x200B;

**Financials**

*Basic ratios*

* Trailing P/E: 27.
* Forward P/E: 20.
* 5yr CAGR: 24%.^(1)
* PEG Ratio (5yr Expected): 0.91.

These generally seem reasonable, especially given broader market averages. Are these ratios indicative of a value play here, or are they below sector averages for a good reason?

*Profitability*

* Consistent revenue growth, but inconsistent profit margin. In Q4 of 2019, they had a 35% profit margin, and haven't reached it since. Last quarters profit margin was 24.7%.^(2) It could prove problematic if BABA's profit margin continues to be unstable.

&#x200B;

^(1) [^(https://finbox.com/NYSE:BABA/explorer/revenue\_proj\_cagr\_5y)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:BABA/explorer/revenue_proj_cagr_5y)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Governmental Environment**

I'm not overly familiar with the antitrust investigations/fines imposed on BABA.

Is China likely to impose real antitrust sanctions on BABA, or is this something that will blow over? Let me know what you think.

BABA's seemingly precarious governmental environment seems to be one of the main reasons the stock has declined the last 4 months or so.

This is something I will have to do a lot more research on before posting a DD.

&#x200B;

**Management**

This is another aspect of BABA I'm not overly familiar with.

Morningstar reported the following on BABA's stewardship:

""Like many other Chinese Internet companies listed in overseas markets, Alibaba operates under a variable interest entity (VIE) structure designed to let companies bypass Chinese legal restrictions on foreign ownership in certain sectors,” explains Hottovy. As a result, foreign investors who hold shares of the firm's VIE domiciled in the Cayman Islands may find that they have limited legal rights. Further, its partnership structure could jeopardize the board’s independence, suggests Hottovy. The partnership is led by a committee of five, which includes Ma and executive vice chairman Joe Tsai, and effectively controls the board and limits the influence of outside shareholders.""^(2)

Does Alibaba's legal structure/stewardship present a significant problem long-term?

&#x200B;

^(2) [^(https://www.morningstar.com/articles/908190/8-good-companies-with-bad-stewardship)](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/908190/8-good-companies-with-bad-stewardship)^(.)

&#x200B;

**AntGroup IPO**

Seemingly related to regulatory issues, AntGroup's IPO (which Alibaba holds 33% stake in), a digital payment platform, was put on hold. One article attributes BABA's ensuing $60bn daily drop to that.

How much will this impact Alibaba moving forward? Other thoughts on AntGroup?

&#x200B;

Today I wanted to talk about my plans of rotating my portfolio when I am 15 years to retirement. ZWB is an etf of only the 6 biggest Canadian banks that sell covered calls on them. They give you back the premium as dividen. It is a pricy etf at 0.71 basis points. but with 6.17 dividen you get 5.46% actual dividen annually. I like the idea of not having to do the covered calls myself and its already deversified so its a bit safer than just doing it with one stock.  


ZWK is the same thing but with american banks. Dividens are about 1% higher (around 6.46%). However, american banks are usually a bit more volatile (which is probably why they get a nicer a premium).  


What do you guys think about having my portfolio around 30% of zwb and 10% of zwk when I turn 50?  
and  
40 % zwb and 20% zwk when im 65.

mbvmqe,,stocks,post,1616553845,"Dollar General to curb logistics costs by expanding private truck fleet

Dive Brief:Dollar General is contending with continued high carrier rates and fuel costs, CFO John Garratt said during the company's earnings call Thursday. Increased costs are also stemming from discretionary bonuses for trucking employees, as well as for workers in distribution centers, Garratt said.To help mitigate transport costs, the company plans to further expand its private truck fleet, Garratt said. The private fleet accounted for more than 20% of outbound logistics at the end of last year, COO Jeff Owen said on the call.The retailer said the recent opening of its dry distribution center in Walton, Kentucky, is expected to help it reduce stem miles and, therefore, costs. It also plans to open two DG Fresh facilities this year, including a combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Nebraska, which Owen said should reduce stem miles over time.

Using Digitization To Solve Supply Chain DisruptionsDownload now

Dive Insight:

Pandemic-driven volume increases were responsible for a portion of the increases in transportation and distribution costs, Dollar General said. And buyers aren't expected to let up on spending any time soon.

""With another round of stimulus checks being mailed right now, we expect another large boost in consumer spending over the next few months,"" National Retail Federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement last week.

But high logistics costs can offset gains in sales. In a recent McKinsey survey of CPG companies, 80% said they did not expect transportation costs to decrease this year from 2020's elevated levels.

""We feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion,"" said Garratt. ""But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So ... these will weigh in the near term.""

Increased volume, mixed with a shortage of trucks and people to drive them, have pushed up truckload rates. Volatility in the trucking market has prompted shippers to focus on procuring reliable carrier capacity.

For some shippers, that means diversification. For others, it means becoming a shipper of choice and leaning on dedicated services, or signing their fleets over to specialists in a conversion to manage capacity.

Dollar General's fleet-bulking strategy would allow it to more frequently skip the third-party pool. Demand surges have kept spot prices elevated.

The pandemic has also put pressure on efficient distribution, though large retailers have been reexamining their networks since before the coronavirus. Surging e-commerce volumes reinforced the need for more capacity.

United Natural Foods and Williams-Sonoma have invested in distribution expansions, with focuses on automation. Dollar General spent $1 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, including planned investments in distribution and transportation, the CFO said

It seems like the worst case is if there's a badly timed crash,  which is on average unlikely. You'd lose your investment if you're not on margin, or you get margin called if you are. But then you can declare bankruptcy and be out of it all in 7 years. 

If you're young, that seems like a reasonable strategy given that the risk is minimal (7 years with bad credit) and somewhat unlikely, while the most likely outcome is serious returns.

Forget a crash for a moment (probably not wise given out situation, but forget it).

You'll have to determine how many down days vs. up days you can expect and if your up days will come after you've lost so much $ on your principal that you don't recoup your losses. 

If SPX goes down 3%, you're out 6-9%. When it goes up after that, you earn a percentage of what's left, not a percentage of your initial investment.

Plus there is less instinct value to the stock. If you buy AMZN and it tanks 10%, you still have a share of AMZN - a real asset and portion of a company. You don't get that with a leveraged fund as much. $2 or $3 out of every dollar isn't an asset. 

You could easily backtest to see how well it works. BUT don't backtest in 2020/2021. 497 of the 500 companies in the S&P have been profitable. It isn't a good baseline to work with IMO.

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['QCOM', 'INTC', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']"

[March 4]    
>Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
>....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['CRM', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'IP', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'FB', 'NI', 'NFLX', 'GS']"

mc095v,,investing,post,1616572099,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.

      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

The nice thing about financial bubbles though are that they help companies raise cash and in turn lend a helping hand to the innovation. In other words they are good for society, for employees and founders of said companies. 

The bad news is the common investor chasing those bubbles tend to fare pretty badly. See anyone that invested in a tech-focused fund in 1999, you'd have been better off just long in UP (a literal railroad stock).

How do you know whether it's a bubble or not? Here's the hint...look at the revenue growth percentage (forward expectations plus backward). Now look at stock price growth. If the later is moving significantly faster than the former...well... How about this analogy for you... If you have a 50% growth in AI engineers a year in New York, but only a 10% annual growth in population...then eventually you'll have more AI engineers than people!

mc717z,,investing,post,1616595953,"Self-driving truck startup TuSimple files to go publicTuSimple, the self-driving truck company that is backed by a diverse consortium of strategic investors, including Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck business The Traton Group, Navistar, Goodyear, and freight company U.S. Xpress, filed Tuesday for an initial public offering.

TuSimple is taking the traditional path to going public, a departure from the recent trend — particularly among electric and autonomous vehicle startups — to merge with a special purpose acquisition companies.

The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, according to the regulatory filing. TuSimple intends to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “TSP.” Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the proposed offering.

According to the company’s S-1, which was filed Tuesday, TuSimple has primarily financed its operations through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and loans from stockholders. The company’s principal sources of liquidity were $310.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, exclusive of restricted cash of $1.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks as well as certificates of deposit.

The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 million in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier.

The company’s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.

TuSimple, which was founded in 2015,  was one of the first autonomous trucking startups to emerge in what has become a small, yet bustling industry that now includes Aurora, Embark, Kodiak and Waymo. While TuSimple’s founding team and its earliest backers Sina and Composite Capital are from China, a chunk of its operations are in the United States, including its global headquarters in San Diego. TuSimple also operates an engineering center and truck depot in Tucson and more recently set up a facility in Texas to support its autonomous trips —always with a human safety operator behind the wheel. TuSimple also has operations in Beijing and Shanghai.

Despite its U.S. operations and U.S. partners, its shares are largely held by Chinese investors, the S-1 prospectus shows. The company’s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group’s The Traton Group. TuSimple’s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.

The Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

^(7) [^(https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)](https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mblhn8,gryx9zj,investing,comment,1616530775,How would this be any different than just using credit or debit cards apart from not needing Visa or Mastercard?,
mblhn8,gryuo1b,investing,comment,1616529641,"> [Cunha] wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

Very cool that this will be open source but it's unlikely to use blockchain as that would remove much of the Fed's toolkit.

> A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange

I would think the opposite, if anything this is as massive endorsement for Bitcoin even if it doesn't use blockchain technology.

Overall very interesting. A future where the reserve currency could be hacked...",
mc71hj,,investing,post,1616595970,"CTXR Conference Call today discussing Mino-lok and Phase 3Hello my fellow **CTXR** friends,

**CTXR** current price: **$2.08**

**CTXR** has been standing steady around the $1.90 - 2.10 range for about 3-4 weeks now.

We are finally closing into the day we have all been waiting for and that is the FDA approval of the Mino-lok. Today and tomorrow **CTXR** is holding a conference call on the Mino-lok phase 3 of the FDA Approval. We have been waiting for this announcement for a little over a month.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citius-pharmaceuticals-highlight-phase-3-130000818.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citius-pharmaceuticals-highlight-phase-3-130000818.html)

From previous analysis on this stock we have a bunch of different Price Targets. Many are assuming $4.00 after the announcement and $8.00 - $12.00 by the end of 2021. Personally I predict this stock could hit $10.00 just off the announcement initially and settle back down to the $4.00-$6.00 range until the company gets the manufacturing and sales inorder. But you have to remember the Mino-lok is not the only catalyst this company holds for products. They have 3 total products going through the trails. Mino-lok is the closest to finalizing.

Incase you didn't know what they are:

Mino-Lok

*Our Mino-Lok product is an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with* [*catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)*](https://www.citiuspharma.com/opportunity/crbsis/)*. CRBSIs are very serious, especially in cancer patients receiving therapy through central venous catheters (CVCs) and in hemodialysis patients where venous access presents a challenge.*

Our Mino-Lok product is intended to salvage the CVC, obviating the need to remove and replace the catheter. This is a recognized unmet medical need. There are few alternatives to removing and replacing the CVC once it becomes infected. Studies show that removal and reinsertion of CVCs have a 15% to 20% complication rate, including pneumothorax, misplacement, and arterial puncture.

Our Mino-Lok product contains a proprietary combination of minocycline, edetate (disodium EDTA), and ethyl alcohol, all of which act synergistically to break down bacterial biofilms, eradicate the bacteria, provide anti-clotting properties to maintain patency in CVCs, and salvage the indwelling catheter. The Mino-Lok product is used in two-hour locking cycles, allowing the CVC to be used for its intended purposes for the remaining 22 hours each day.

CITI-002

CITI-002 is a topical formulation of halobetasol and lidocaine that is intended to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief to individuals suffering from hemorrhoids. In the United States, hemorrhoids affect nearly 5% of the population, with approximately 10 million patients annually reporting symptoms.

Mino-Wrap (CITI-101)

Our Mino-Wrap product (CITI-101) is a malleable, bio-absorbable film impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. It is designed to reduce infections associated with the use of breast tissue expanders (TE) used in breast reconstruction surgeries following mastectomies.

Mino-Wrap is placed over or wrapped around the TE in the surgical pocket as a solid film. It swells and liquefies in situ for a specified period of time providing extended protection against infection from the most likely pathogens. In January 2019, Citius signed a definitive worldwide license agreement with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to develop and commercialize this novel approach to reducing postoperative infections associated with surgical implants. Mino-Wrap is being reviewed by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) division.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This company is a billion dollar company if the Mino-Lok gets the FDA Approval.

The cost of CRBSIs is between **$33,000 and $44,000** in the general adult ICU, between **$54,000 and $75,000** in the adult surgical ICU, and approximately **$49,000** in the pediatric ICU.

Being the only player in the game. This has huge upside potential especially once they have the manufacture in place and the product is in production we should see massive amounts of cash flow.

Financial Results:

What should we expect in the next few days? Well IMO I think we will start seeing heavy volume starting to flow in since the announcement is near. If we can start getting heavy volume the price could easily reach new highs as CTXR has a low float and has some big institutional investors.

Market Cap:  
**241.59M**

Outstanding Shares:  
**125.78M**

Share Float:  
**67.62M**

If the volume is heavy this price could reach my target on announcement very easily. Remember if the FBA approval gets approved this is easily a billion dollar company. We are only at a 241.59M Market Cap. Based on my numbers the company can Revenue around 1.6 Billion dollars with Mino-Lok alone. If this is the case we are looking at a 5 bagger - 7 bagger in the making coming very soon!!!

Stay tuned because this stock is about to explode!!!

mbpykh,,investing,post,1616536716,"Dip buyers: It's a good time to get into small capsFor everyone who hasn't noticed: it's an excellent time to get into small caps.

The  Russell 2000 is down about 7% from its all time high on March 15th but  still up over 10% on the year to date. This is on top of the 18% return  during 2020. When measured from the March lows, it is now up 87%  compared to the 44% for the S&P 500 and 68% for the NASDAQ.

From  a macro perspective, small caps tend to lead during the beginning of a  new bull market. Based on everything I've read, most predictions are  that it will continue to outperform the broader market for the  foreseeable future and this correction is a very good buying point.

It's  also a solid bet if you're bullish on the reopening trade and/or want  some diversification. The top 10 biggest components (which weighted at  \~4.5% are still very small compared to the S&P \[27%\] or NASDAQ \[44%\]  ) are:

* **Penn National Gaming**\--up 29% YTD
   * gambling
* **Plug Power**\--up 8.5% YTD
   * renewable energy
* **Caesars Entertainment**\--up 13.9% YTD
   * also gambling
* **Novavax**\--up 97% YTD
   * vaccine maker that's likely about to get approved for a COVID vaccine
* **Darling Ingredients**\--up 19.5% YTD
   * something in agribusiness/food waste I think?
* **A company that sells games that has been in the news lately**\--up 864% YTD

   * clothing and shoes
* **Builders Firstsource**\--up 3.6% YTD
   * construction materials
* **Sunrun**\--down 19% YTD

mc8nea,,investing,post,1616599768,"Fluent (FLNT) - Highly volatile + Market Psychology play 

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

\- It has been recently (17.03.2021) **downgraded from 'Outperform' to 'Market Perform'** by Barrington Research, due to the slowdown in the growth for the fourth-quarter. The management claims that their decision ""... to limit its business to higher-quality advertising traffic..."" **may result in being beneficial in the long term** ([Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/why-fluent-stock-was-slammed-on-wednesday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)). Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

**Information worth noting;**

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

The company offers short-term loans to the underbanked   Chinese consumer market, their potential customer base is 430 million people. They also own a variety of other ventures including Wanlimu a   luxury consumer brand as well as 30% of Secoo with which they have a strategic partnership. Recently Qudian has invested in an early learning   education company (TAM $700B), as well as nearing completion on its   business park which will be completed this year.

Much like some other stocks was last year Qudian has been beaten to a pulp by the market. As of today (13/03/21) the company has a market cap of \~$490M. It’s shareholder equity? $1.655B. Yes, that’s not a typo this company has a price to asset ratio of 0.33. But now I hear you ask but what   about its earnings? In the three months to September 30 it made 87 million. Yuan? No, DOLLARS. Oh, and did I mention it has $219 million in cash?

The company has been through some tough times the last couple of years, with its regulatory   environment unstable and its earnings shrinking, that and its asset   quality decreased due to the rapid rise in delinquency rates during   COVID. I believe the company is turning the corner on this front,   however when you buy the stock you are not just buying a credit business, the CFO and CEO have stated they want to acquire companies   much in the same vein as Warren Buffet did with Berkshire Hathaway.

However   recently the CCP has stated that the next growth engine for China will not be an increase in factory capacity it will be from domestic consumption. What drives growth in an economy switching from production to consumption? Credit pure and simple. Qudian has outlasted a lot of   it’s competitors by tightening it’s lending policy, whilst this   conservative strategy has impacted it’s short term earnings it is now in   a place it in a position to capitalise on the new direction the government is taking on the economy.

Book value: $6.87 (164% above current price)

Base case: $10

Bull case: $17.5 or fair value (Excess Returns Model, Simply Wall St.)

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",
mbvs0e,gs1o9xi,investing,comment,1616592794,"~~Can you give the table number? Table 7 on pg 379 of the full prospectus is maybe what you’re looking at?~~

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']

Let's say you are an individual investor and you get cheap margin or take out a loan on your real-estate etc and buy ETFs with that money. Surely this amplifies the return of the underlying and you don't need to worry about rebalancing yourself.

Now say instead of an individual investor, you pool together other investors and buy non-leveraged ETFs.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['JPM', 'ADI']"

Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['NDAQ', 'HD']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['KSU', 'NSC', 'UNP', 'CSX']"

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

I know this is a long post and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I don't really have a specific question, I would just like to hear any feedback (besides, your an idiot, and don't ever buy stocks again), advice, even similar stories.",

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

That'll happen when you compare a global fund vs a US only fund and focus only on the US part of the US/ex-US cycle. I can almost certainly point to times where VTI would have been worse than IWDA.

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

m9dmdf,,investing,post,1616266670,"Financial Market PessimismFinancial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

m9i525,,investing,post,1616280238,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

Most Poshmark sellers sell their product through other marketplaces as well (ebay, mercari, grailed), that offer less fees for both seller and buyer.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to.

m9adbw,,investing,post,1616257440,"Understanding China's economy & the embedded risks: This video has a surprisingly balanced and good take describing a lot of the risks and drivers of the Chinese economy.Watch the video here please [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg)

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

* Brazil
* India
* Russia
* China

The only one that is moving forward economically with much strength is China.  Those other three have fallen out of favor for a variety of means.  About 5 years ago, we we were seeing an exchange rate of 5.6 RMB to one USD.  Recently it's transposed digits to 6.5 RMB.  The same can be said of the Russian Ruble going from 56 to one USD, and now 74 to one USD.  

When your investments are analyzed and brought back, understand the FOREX component which can inflate (or deflate) your gains.  

The WSJ used to have an ""arbitrage"" portion in their paper to describe the cost of common goods like a cup of coffee or a BMW X5 (which was massive exported from the US market to the Chinese market for gain due to demand and currency price differences)  to let people know how much they're getting here, and abroad.",
m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",
m9adbw,grrytsx,investing,comment,1616385176,"Chinese politics aren't as one sided as folks might think.

- PBOC and other finance folks are the smart ones in the room.

- Military is filled with war mongers who don't understand economics. 

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0. US will fall back to Latin America for cheap labor, etc. 

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity. The island itself is worthless. You take Taiwan by force and you gain nothing but a small piece of land. Taiwanese will leave en masse.",

I didn't know about Ordos City the video talks about, so I googled it, turns out it's a city located in Inner Mongolia, which I know from my textbook back to high school, the extreme dry, windy weather and high latitude Plateau(ah, words might be redundant, but you got what I mean). I understand that the video might be true(as I said I didn't know the city, and I believe many Chinese don't know it either, and this is the point!), but it's biased to generalize the whole country, then talk about the economics of the whole giant China(financially, it's a complex, multi-dimensional system after all), this doesn't make sense to me, anyway, this is not the first time political motivated... But, seriously, people living in this side of the world(mainly America and Europe) should at least understand how big geographically china is, and why the northern west part of China is less developed.  Mostly, minorities live there with their own languages, majority people from southern/northern east part of China where full of mountains and rivers won't choose the live there, while all the youtubers like to take this special rare sample as prove base to show the world what China is like and will be, tbh, seeing modern houses/apartments building there is actually encouraging.

Like I said, I didn't know this city, but I do know a famous singer who is from Inner Mongolia, like many others coming to southern/Northern East of China for their career, seeking opportunities, making their stories known to everyday Chinese people like me. So we know how hard it is living there, and the government is promoting/making policies that keep encouraging us fresh graduates/investors to go there help the local economics by bringing the tourism, donation, building house, utilizing the wind resources for electricity generation and teaching/educating homeless kids/orphans there etc..  Of course their lives are getting better, and still because they are minorities, the weather is just not suitable for living  in long term, not many people would like to move to live there.

With that knowledge in mind, let's come back to the video and reviews, it just makes no sense to make any conclusions/judgments about the whole Chinese economics based on those rare less developing cities while they are improving, but people buying whatever those youtubers feed to their reviewers. I'm making this comment to pint it out, as I saw so many posts and videos use this same strategy to get the attention especially on YouTube, generating revenues for themselves, while brainwashing people who don't know about China, just keep it in mind, be open and the so called democracy is defined differently in different minds of people, although we all use the same word ""democracy""!

Please don't attack me or call me CCP bot whatever, it will hurts me, makes me sad, because I'm a legit human, I have feelings, I'm just here to provide you more information. All those hates and conspiracies are from misunderstanding, and I don't like to argue with people, always choose to be positive.",

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['PGR', 'UPS']"
m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

No debt

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers.

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

m8ugyr,grmpuy8,investing,comment,1616274792,"I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway.

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account.

All I can say is Research, Research, Research, and Buy and Hold Novonix people if your serious in EV battery investment!

Right now is a good opportunity to look at the EV and Microgrid sector with some detailed research and decide if investing in this field should fit your portfolio for a long hold. Clean energy is supported at a level it finally deserves with the current U.S. Government Administration. The recent sell-off in clean energy was a needed correction, but companies like Novonix will be severely undervalued soon in being that they are working to support the growing demand for Lithium-ion technology and the resources to support it. China is major competition, but either way you look at it, they may not have enough resources to support their own transition to EV and Microgrid clean energy within the next few years.

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too.

The Department of Labor released its weekly report on new jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg:

   Initial jobless claims, week ended March 13: 770,000 vs. 700,000 expected and 712,000 during the prior week

Initial unemployment claims were expected to hold below 800,000 for a fourth consecutive week. Still, initial jobless claims remain above the Great Recession-era high of 665,000 from 2009.

And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?

What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech?

The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)
2. Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal.

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?  


My  background: New to the channel and to reddit, I was brought here by  crypto.I  am looking into subject company, considering that the net-0  emissions  targets are only possible by nuclear energy. I have always  admired the clean and cheap features of nuclear energy, I always  supported it and I anticipate it's golden era.Now, on investing, I would  like your take on  this company, and to initiate discussions which will  circle knowledge  through.Bear in mind that there are some restrictions  to investing in  this company if you are an American at the time of  writing.Last, I  want to avoid the trap of replicating the returns i got  from crypto. My  thinking is long term >5 years and I give weight  both on the  narrative and on fundamentals.",

I think its overvalued because of the shit show that is nuclear power here, especially for a beijing based company. Utilities here are hooooooooooooooooorribly run, with nuclear being only slightly better than hydro electric.

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

*95% of the time, you’re underwater. The less you look, the better off you’ll be.*

**2. The Dow has compounded at less than 3 basis points a day since 1970. Since then it’s up more than 3,000%.**  
*Compounding really is magic.*

**3. The Dow has only been positive 52% of all days. The average daily return is 0.73% when it’s up and -0.76% when it’s down.**  
*See above.*

**4. The Dow has spent more time 40% or more below the highs than within 2% of the highs (20.6% of days vs. 18.4% of days)**  
*No pain, no gain.*

**5. The Dow gained 38 points in the 1970s**  
*See above.*

**6. Why am I using the Dow instead of the S&P 500? They’re effectively the same thing. The rolling one-year correlation since 1970 is .95.**  
*Stop wasting your time on this.*

**7. At the low in 2009, U.S. stocks were back to where they were in 1996.**

*Stocks generally outperform bonds, but there are no guarantees.*

**11. Gold and the Dow were both 800 in 1980. Today Gold is $1,700/ounce. The Dow is near 32k.**  
*Cash flows > commodities.*

**12. Over the last twenty years, Gold is up 340%. Stocks are up 208%, with dividends.**  
*You can support any argument by changing the start and end dates.*

**13. Since 1980, Gold is up 153%. Inflation is up 230%.**  
*See above.*

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much, it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

Since this post, numerous people have messaged me with more information around FTFT. I personally found it very insightful and thought this community would as well. I've looked deeper into those comments and this is what I've found.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

---

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grd5s0u,investing,comment,1616078801,Incredible.  I already posted this below your original post: it reads like the script for a Netflix docuseries.,['NFLX']
m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat.

A common index investing strategy is some S&P500, some international and put some away in bonds/bank (percentages don’t really matter for this example)

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population. 

So if you were Japanese (I would also love for actual Japanese citizens to chime in), how much money would you put into the Nikkei.

That is why the Nikkei really stays so stagnant. If you are a Value investor sure you can make money in Japan, if you are a growth investor Nikkei has not been the place to be. America on the other hand has so many high growth companies in SP500 its capital gains just keep going up. America also keeps pushing innovations in many industries.

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['EBAY', 'ETSY', 'PYPL', 'AMZN']"

It's a sinking ship currently, and they need a really big idea to plug a lot of holes. 

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['EBAY', 'FB', 'AMZN']"

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

With the massive influx of people into ""reddit investing"" I assume a significant percentage to be novice (I'm trying to keep it polite). 

That being said, the less sophisticated the  investor, the more likely they would be to act ""later"" and with less regard to risk and volatility. And yet I believed they WOULD act. 

I really feel as if the last 2 months has created a FOMO phenomenon and that there is significant, traditionally irrational buying. 

I just could not figure out a way to quantify and then be able to act on it.

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

(Market cap calculations used for 50 years out is multiplying by 29.45, which is 1.07^50)",['SPGI']

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.","['WMT', 'AMZN']"

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['PWR', 'ED']"
m6w7uv,,investing,post,1615972004,"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.As I see it:

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx.

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter","['NDAQ', 'SBUX', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']"

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['PGR', 'GPS']"

Efficiency also isn't a binary, it exists within gradients in all markets - so something like large cap stock is far more efficient than junk debt, but both are less efficient than treasuries.  Still the idea that efficiency is a perfect condition that exists magically simply isn't a reality.

2) if EMH were accepted as some sort of holy truth then a poorly written blog post citing trades would not constitute strong evidence.

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

m6zzhm,,investing,post,1615986444,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['ARKK', 'TER', 'MMM', 'TXN', 'NVDA', 'QCOM', 'BA', 'INTC', 'IBM']"

m7c6gf,,investing,post,1616019296,"Apple (fruit) stock analogySo many people are talking about stocks this year, which is similar to the past times when stocks are shooting up and the majority of people are generally winning for now, and feeling good about it, and eager to talk about it, for all sorts of reasons.  

That includes everyone from novice investors to advanced and sophisticated investors, and everyone in between.

One of the most concerning things I hear is this.  

""You should by X.""

""Why?""

""Oh, it was 300 dollars yesterday.  It's 250 now.  So it's cheap.  It's going to go back up"".

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

Good luck out there, be careful, and have fun.",['AAPL']

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

Not only BABA's app got deleted they are many other app got warning.

m6w42x,gr7ymhr,investing,comment,1615973992,"Need some advice here.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

So, am I thinking in the right direction? What would be the best course of action for me?",['TSLA']

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

m6wb43,gr7ya7l,investing,comment,1615973628,"Agree with Facebook’s and Apple’s and Coke’s. If you do a Porter five forces analysis on these you can see where the moats comes up (ie Coke has a lot of power over its suppliers).

Amazon is Jeff’s flywheel. More customers = more revenue to invest in CapEx = more capabilities/lower prices = more customers. There’s a massive CapEx moat if you want to enter the logistics or data center business.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM. Intel is struggling against AMD and NVIDIA right now and is losing share. What you have down was correct about a decade ago, today it doesn’t hold.","['AMZN', 'AAPL', 'NVDA', 'FB', 'INTC', 'AMD']"
m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.  The once mighty Grand Met is no more.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'KO']"
m6lakz,,investing,post,1615933928,"Plug power - unravelling the jargonI do love having a go at deciphering the management bullsh8t when they have dodgy accounts (sorry if you own it). Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.


Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

m69ifj,,investing,post,1615902668,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['NDAQ', 'BLK', 'UPS']"

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.

They are able to appeal to the vanity of their customers in the quest for a perfect lawn by selling upscale packaging and lawn photographs.  Being able to sell fertilizer for $20 a bag and dirt for $5 a bag is no easy task but they do it.  The problem is see here is transferring those skills to the marijuana play.  Marketing the way Scott’s does won’t work the same way and it may actually form part of the regulations that come out on legalization.  The government wants the revenues but they don’t want giant dope leaf advertising everywhere.  The subdued nature of the rollout will restrict their upside and not allow them to play to their strengths.  Time and acceptance of the new market may change this however.,

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

mbqrgb,,StockMarket,post,1616538937,"Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, another generational bull market has begun - The ultimate silver DD. $PSLV $SILJI’ve already posted DDs on silver in WallStreetBets a couple times, but I decided to come to r/StockMarket this time because WSB is completely focused on GME at the moment. 

Note this is not a post to tell you sell your GME. I’m personally still long GME.

In fact I hope I GME hits $1000 after earnings, I salute you fellow Apes.

&#x200B;

Silver however, is the market I have done the most research for, and why I am writing this DD. 

This post is quite long so here’s the **TLDR if you are lazy:** Buy PSLV and get ready to ride the silver rocketship. Alternatively, purchase 1000oz bars of silver at premiums under 5% to ride the rocket.

Quick Bullets:

* Silver will rise dramatically due to a fundamentals-based rally in industrial and monetary demand
* A short squeeze in silver is on the precipice of occurring, and could add gasoline to a bonfire, current short interest is 513%
* SLV is a scam, if you own it then sell and purchase PSLV (and the same goes for GLD, you can buy PHYS instead)
* The banks that run the silver market have been labeled ‘criminal enterprises’ by the DOJ, for metals price manipulation, and these are the same banks entrusted with SLV/SIVR

&#x200B;

There are two types of bull markets in silver.  One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand.  The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze.  Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets. 

**I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.** 

So what are these ‘smoke alarms’ I mentioned? 

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle. 

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‘smoke’.  

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP.  More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/5yh58ntwguo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da878286af614bfa216734371b1b9c257726612

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply. 

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at.  Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver.  

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying.  In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.  

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP). 

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

 

https://preview.redd.it/h6tfe4kvguo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=64a5e124ddf99608ab11470b0492fa9642553df2

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.  

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.  

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high).  Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater).  Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested.  Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation).  This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011.  Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities.  The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period.  Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation).  There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market. 

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples.  And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms.  Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse.  Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities. 

https://preview.redd.it/77j9noo9huo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c794b8d8b8e339ebeac5757add7cf7492a8949a

I in no way think this is coming to the United States.  I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse.  Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn’t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade. 

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91.  Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs).  Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021.  Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.  

&#x200B;

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver.  Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations.  (LN scale because silver is nature’s money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out.  And there’s really no reason it must stop there.**  

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement MMT related policies with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue.  This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring.  Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more).  The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended.  What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates.  And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

 

https://preview.redd.it/dyp2056qhuo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa926d50b73015ff6106b64c546d79c60369ec6

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant.  They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed.  As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don’t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in.  Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation’s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high.  So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself.  They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high).  So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation?  The value of the dollar.  We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform). 

The other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment.  In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies.  Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation. 

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job.  The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years.  At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years. 

&#x200B;

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now.  This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too.  Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well.  There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well.  Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting.  The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates. 

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all).  How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable.  Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well. 

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors).  **The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.**  And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need?  And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It’s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver. 

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input?  Silver. Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable.  So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further. 

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lh1uc7shuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7173278d6cf25987cf42ca93fd64caeed499c2

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon.  The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation. 

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer.  I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any.  The move back into having even a small precious metals allocation it is what drives silver up by 30x or more. 

&#x200B;

Now it is time to dive deeper into the other contributor to the silver bull market, **the short squeeze.**  

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver. 

Lets dig into the silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself. 

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity.  So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date.  Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn’t exist, then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver.  Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality. 

&#x200B;

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market.  They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass.  They only do it if they really have to.  Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery.  Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market. 

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver.  The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight.  But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers. 

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently? 

Let’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/3o4eda0zhuo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5212d0ec99fa8fadc3e87d7d97da0327f9bd9a06

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered.  This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find. 

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis. 

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is. 

https://preview.redd.it/y0zbsru0iuo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5619336c219421bc93c10be859dd581814fdb7

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic.  While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze.  The 2001-2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x.  In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.  

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0wd4lwgqkuo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf26d8204bc0817457ebe56a6354ba7ede4ad8e

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered.  It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse.  It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell. 

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort.  And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American.  If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX.  That’s how tight this market is. 

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check.  If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher. 

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract’s open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/knr5kwz7iuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07edc45ea6d245cb58ff972cc93b847861d6c6e

It looks almost unreal.  And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves.  That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/pf93niaaiuo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4835e10de33e28790f7c588858c883df25f44949

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x.  Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.  

April’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces.  20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.   

Here’s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/9qehkardiuo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeeaccab17039c03f9b8214dabfce7dea377ea18

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)?  Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May:

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lgflbrhiuo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84d4fe485a9a5a0cafeb7e6d8a40f99a88049a0

https://preview.redd.it/j3u861k0juo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee4cc550f8b790a913f7ce073ae9afe8e6f5230

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%.  Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.  

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations.  This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic.  As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.  

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough.  Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.  

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders.  The GME short squeeze may indeed return, because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can’t force them to sell. 

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, [they forced them to sell](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunt-brothers-trying-to-corner-silver-market-2016-5).  The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing silver.  There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze.  

The regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market.  Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’.  The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each.  There is no cornering the market going on.  This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them.  They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion.  Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors. 

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played? 

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.** – Unless their bluff is truly called, and short squeeze occurs. Which means that the paper supply (contract silver that exists in the form of short futures contracts) has to be bought back at far higher prices to prevent further margin calls and possible insolvency. 

When the silver squeeze began in late January, there was a flurry of media interviews and articles by experts who claimed that a retail driven short squeeze just isn’t possible.  Why were they so confident? Because the banks have owned this game since futures began trading, and retail buyers don’t purchase 1000oz bars, they tend to purchase 1oz coins.

These small unit coins and bars are produced by mints both public and private.  These mints take 1000oz bars and use them to produce smaller silver bars and coins, but there is a limit to their production capacity. In normal times a mint might produce 5 million ounces a year, and in a time like today when demand is surging maybe they run the machines 24 hours a day and pump that production up to 10 million ounces in a year.  Does this add to demand for 1000oz bars? Yes, but the amount that it can add is capped at the production capacity of the mints.  Beyond the amount production can be ramped up, demand simply pushes premiums for these small units of silver higher, rather than the price of silver itself.  The large banks who are short 1000oz bars know that demand from this channel is capped, and thus they feel perfectly safe remaining in, or even increasing their short positions when retail coin and bar demand surges. 

Once small unit silver premiums soar, the next place retail investors start to place money is in silver ETFs, primarily the SLV ETF.  This is where the real fucking over of retail silver investors starts. 

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

“In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.” – Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault.  They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it’s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX.  Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all.  So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren’t.  The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs.  Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors.  He truly meant what he said. 

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF. 

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring.  Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows.  **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.**  When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange.  As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price.  It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits.  Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out: 

 

[Reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/b8patrd4juo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=733303b57df19c5133ea50432dc6068640b543a0)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future.  What does this even mean?  Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market, that’s actually not the case.  What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market.  They will not purchase silver to accumulate additional inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to. 

&#x200B;

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong.  **Purchasing SLV is the best way for a silver investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.** 

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange.  SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural. 

For example, when millions of people buy Tesla stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise. 

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker. 

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows?  Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‘bank participation report’ which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF.  The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market.  The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021.  I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks’ net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

 

https://preview.redd.it/vydektr6juo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68f0678d992f1c30c33a84436034dbabe133f8d

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions.  What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze. 

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It’s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before the squeeze happens. 

For further evidence of this theme of, “If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall” look no further than the deliveries data itself,

https://preview.redd.it/r9jxmp28juo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bfcaa15c404d6e9be8425ea739265c17282b82

You’ll notice that as long as investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed and uptick, the price would begin to fall once again.  This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery.  Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need? 

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you’ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries.  **The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.**  

And lest you think I’m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?  

https://preview.redd.it/igxaamq4luo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a66830bff69ec316cb2c49b5fb2de495777b608

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.  Silver is the best candidate for this to occur. 

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets.  Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

 

https://preview.redd.it/ulkem3jbjuo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f30331fc8817bf081ce4b4fdf316a51765f1396

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur.  I’m not saying the silver isn’t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence? 

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?  

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery).  Further, Sprott buys its silver directly, it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace.  And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.  This is what is starting to happen right now.  And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks.  Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.  

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.  

I’d highly recommend at least some allocation to physical silver through PSLV, and actual physical bars and coins (when premiums come down to earth) as soon as possible. If you are a large player and can take delivery on the COMEX that is easily the cheapest and best route to get exposure as well. 

**Alternate plays with more risk and potential reward include silver miners, silver miner ETFs, and call options on these silver stocks.** 

**Whatever you do, don’t buy any silver ETFs that aren’t PSLV.** 

Silver is about to ride a rocket to the moon, the banks will get what they deserve, screw the suits, retail investors deserve to win for once, whether its silver or GME.  It’s time the banks played by the rules of the system like the rest of us.

I took a few swing positions in 5 of my favorite stocks (all growth stocks) about 10 days ago. Originally I had planned for 2-3 day swing trade. All these companies were trading at a great discount from all time highs after the market wide sell off a few weeks back. I bought in during the rally and of course it was right before the bond yield scare and current chaos plunged the NASDAQ. My entire account is tied up in these trades and I guess I could’ve managed my dollar cost averaging better but I just didn’t foresee a major market correction, especially since the market had just finished selling off a good chunk. 

I’m leaning towards holding out. Since all of my stocks have reached oversold on the RSI (of course that doesn’t mean they can’t continue to sell off) but unless we’re heading for a serious market correction it just wouldn’t make sense to cash out and buy back in.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with bitcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with bitcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

The formation of, xSigma Entertainment was created to acquire assets that will increase shareholder value by targeting businesses that are in growth industries, that have the ability to grow in scale, and that will allow the Company and its shareholders to realize additional growth alongside its existing core business.
--

When we look at the price on the daily chart, where one candlesticks represents one day of a price action, the trend is clearly a strong uptrend as the price on average has been increasing 15 trading days in a row!

This trend however has to break at some point and see a deeper correction as before, possibly forming another bullish formation, a good spot to potentially buy some more ZKIN shares.

When a possible correction occurs, it's forecasted to test 50 EMA, which is located at $6.50 currently! But of course it will not drop so low even if the correction starts today as the EMA is rising dynamically.

But is such correction on the horizon?

In the last bull run to $12.80, the average volume was less than 2 millions shares traded daily.

In this run, the volume is almost 5x that as today's average volume is more than 9 millions shares traded!

MACD is showing no signs of slowing down as the bullish momentum continues to extend.

But RSI is pointing towards a bearish divergence as the price is currently clearly making a new higher high while RSI is making a lower highs, so I would be aware of possible correction.

But do not worry as such correction is nothing unusual in a healthy price growth.",

I use Fidelity, and I've got a decent chunk in MSOS, but it seems like they're more focused on medical marijuana. I'm curious if anyone knows of any funds specifically focused on the companies related to the growth of recreational weed?

This [article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/27/toke-lahoma-cannabis-market-oklahoma-red-state-weed-legalization-437782) really opened my eyes on this market fragmentation with many independent growers and retailers. You must also factor in that states that will allow you to grow it for personal consumption.

In the short term, you can profit with some of the growers; however in my opinion, the real market are the suppliers to the growers (regulatory compliance, inventory control, pest management (like natural products from $MBII) , etc.) and the derivative market (beverages, edibles, topicals (like the CBD plays), and pharmaceutical actives) - hopefully the ETFs will cover these markets to afford maximum exposure.

Never in that time have I seen the stars align so much for this asset.  Besides the strong fundamental case, we have world currencies about to undergo ""The Great Reset"", a World Economic Forum initiative to basically cover up the poison of FIAT currencies.  Let's not forget the attention the metal got through Wall Street Bets and now Wall Street Silver.  The latter group will be throwing up billboards promoting the ownership of silver starting next month.  

Now let's get to the technical picture.  Silver has had two spikes in price up to $50 an ounce.  The first was the Hunt Brothers event in 1980 and since that time, the metal has traced out a giant cup and handle pattern, that anyone who has any working knowledge of technical analysis will recognize in this.  I am pretty much all in on silver now.  The Bitcoin chart looks god awful and the equities markets are teetering in my opinion.

I also don’t want to just toss it into an index fund as I personally believe I’ll be able to pick the best stocks from each sector (or at least the top 25% in each sector) and outperform the general market as a whole. I also enjoy doing research on companies as it lets me stay up to date on what is driving our society from the business perspective and juxtapose that to my personal perspective.

mc20ur,,StockMarket,post,1616580132,"OCUGEN, IS THE TIME FOR A NEW SPIKE? There's a ton of DD on these already, so I don't need to say more. I want to analyze this from the position of political science and economics.

Let's start saying that I agree Ocugen is a very risky play because even if the data out there already suggests that it will be a cheap and effective vaccine, covaxin is ENTIRELY depending on getting approval in the US. There are several reasons to be bullish:

1. Biden is relying heavily on technocrats. That's why he doesn't say anything public - he does backdoor deals to try to get policies through, taking the load of Manchin and other centrists. Remember, Biden was in the Senate for decades and was vice-president, that's just him.

2. The technocrats are former Obama folks. Their BIG push right now is the Quad, which is a quasi alliance designed to contain China. South Korea and Japan are the weak legs - they hate each other due to history issues. India is the absolute key to the quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy  

3. Covaxin is India's big Pharma play and they will push it with the other quad members if they want India to help balance China. 

4. India is also one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines (generics). This is important for Modi's economic development model to get his vaccines in the West. OCGN will be able to produce a lot of vaccine for cheap. The problem is PURELY a bottleneck issue, will the US give authorization? I think yes since the Biden people desperately need India in the quad and Indo (Indian Ocean) Pacific (Pacific Ocean) strategy. Those Biden/Obama folks also have a bone to pick with Trump, and are all in on the science/vaccine train. They see no problem with increasing US supply. They don't give a shit about who makes the vaccine.   

5. The US and China just had an AWFUL meeting in Alaska where China was basically talking shit for 13 minutes. US basically said, don't best against us - a threat to China.     Of course, we still need phase 3 data. Until that's out, we just got to wait. But ALL of the geopolitics point to obvious reasons why there will be approval.

In the morning of Wednesday, March 24th at 9:30 AM, if my BID was within the range of the Bid-Ask spread, there's a great chance that my order would execute, and I'm the owner of a relatively cheap Call Option for a stock who's price increased by 6.6% but who's underlying option doesn't reflect this increase.

based on my question, you will notice that I am new to investing. After having a few winners in 2020, I got tired of trying to pick stocks and want to move into a more defensive position: exchange traded index fund (ETFs).

I am trying to figure out if a monthly investment of $300 over the next 20+ years is better in MSCI World (60% USA, 12% Europe, 7% Japan etc.) or in S&P 500 (100% US). 

Why I am hesitating? Of course I want higher returns and historically the S&P500 has been better than the overall world market (if my research on the topic is correct). Also, USA has around 60% weight in the MSCI World and the top 10 holdings in MSCI World are also the top 10 companies in the S&P500 index (except Nestle, which is Swiss). Basically the US is the driving force here. 

Therefore I was thinking, why not invest 100% in the US instead of only 60%. I understand that this question implies another question, which is ""Do you think that the US economy and the US stock market will continue to yield high returns on the long term?"". Difficult question to answer. 

However, I'd be happy to hear your opinions or recommendations on which strategy is the best for long-term investing.

P.S. I know Michael Burry hates ETFs, because he thinks that they are, quote: ""draining brains"". People are giving up on doing their own DDs for single stocks and rely only on the overall market passively. What are your thoughts on this?","['SPGI', 'MSCI']"

It sounds like some big companies (Amazon and Epic games are mentioned as potential bidders as well) are interested in capitalizing on discord's future.

I use discord and run a community and am also a subscriber for the past few years. If they go public I am definitely in. While they are firmly established as a place for people to socialize while playing video games, they've got their eye on expanding beyond the video game sphere.

I use slack for work but discord is superior as a collaborative tool. That's probably where Microsoft sees value. They can also provide discord as part of Windows. I think this can be good for both assuming Microsoft continues its trend toward becoming a more open platform than it's been in the past.

Because discord is also still firmly grounded in video game culture, there's overlap with Microsoft's Xbox and PC gaming I'm general. It's hard to imagine more value being provided by the other bidders in this situation. Still, Discord also has done very well on its own and the size of this bid suggests it would thrive even without being purchased. I'd bet that if they went public, Microsoft would buy up a lot of shares. Their futures are intertwined.","['MSFT', 'AMZN']"

mbo9jc,,StockMarket,post,1616532034,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 23, 2021 Stocks pulled back Tuesday, extending the recent bout of volatility, as market participants considered commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Moreover, a rise in COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted a new lockdown in Germany. 

Market participants closely monitored remarks from both Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.”

While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market remains volatile, with Treasury yields rising once again in anticipation of strong economic recovery and inflationary fears that could cause the Fed to reign back sooner-than-expected. We think the fear is overblown, given the Fed’s consistency in this stance. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Early today, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

I've seen more chatter and russle around the Renewable Energy sector then ever before. Energy Storage is the new hot topic of things to come in the near future.

With Renewable Energy the goal is to keep a system Sustainable, in present times the typical energy storage solution has a lithium battery storing energy to release when needed and that's the problem. Lithum Batteries simply dont last long enough, they have a limited lifespan that damages performances over charge cycles active as a 'bottleneck' to the sustainable solution, not to mention the flammable risks.
Doesn't sound very Sustainable.

This is where the next generation of Energy Storage is born. So much talk and chatter around the subject with news outlets sharing light on 'new battery devopment' or articles sharing the latest battery installation at a brand new Solar Farm, for example.

For me, after reading up on the 'next big thing' - I'd have to side with the a Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB). I recommend reading up on the subject and DYOR into how the world will chance stace from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

If you're an investor trying to put some smart money into a stock, I'd recommend reading into Bushveld Minerals #BMN - A company one of the highest amounts on Vanadium reserves in their South Africa mine with alot of side streams actively being very profitable.

The  Russell 2000 is down about 7% from its all time high on March 15th but  still up over 10% on the year to date. This is on top of the 18% return  during 2020. When measured from the March lows, it is now up 87%  compared to the 44% for the S&P 500 and 68% for the NASDAQ.

From  a macro perspective, small caps tend to lead during the beginning of a  new bull market. Based on everything I've read, most predictions are  that it will continue to outperform the broader market for the  foreseeable future and this correction is a very good buying point.

It's  also a solid bet if you're bullish on the reopening trade and/or want  some diversification. The top 10 biggest components (which weighted at  \~4.5% are still very small compared to the S&P \[27%\] or NASDAQ \[44%\]  ) are:

* **Penn National Gaming**\--up 29% YTD
   * gambling
* **Plug Power**\--up 8.5% YTD
   * renewable energy
* **Caesars Entertainment**\--up 13.9% YTD
   * also gambling
* **Novavax**\--up 97% YTD
   * vaccine maker that's likely about to get approved for a COVID vaccine
* **Darling Ingredients**\--up 19.5% YTD
   * something in agribusiness/food waste I think?
* **A company that sells games that has been in the news lately**\--up 864% YTD
   * mentioning it apparently gets the post removed by the automod
* **Lithia Motors**\--up 27% YTD
   * car sales
* **Deckers Outdoors**\--up 11% YTD
   * clothing and shoes
* **Builders Firstsource**\--up 3.6% YTD
   * construction materials
* **Sunrun**\--down 19% YTD

But my broker provides a 10-15x margin on equity delivery also. So won't this make equity with margins riskier than options, since in future and options you have an option in getting out of contract but if you have that many shares on margin with you the risk is a lot higher and hence the loss is higher because you have brought the stock at entire price.

Commercialization is a time consuming process and I think this is likely a standard move in that direction toward faster distribution if it is approved. Back in the summer other vaccine makers like [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine) were producing before they got approval which is why they had 50 million doses in November 2020. It doesn’t mean they will be approved. Just means they want to be ready to party if they get approved.,['PFE']

I was investing on Polish stock market for almost 20 years with nice results and as my investments value grew significantly I decided to diversify and move some portion of my money to US. I'm here since 2 years now. I started with some Dividend Aristocrats and it is working for me surprisingly well so far (around 30% gains is much more than I expected)

I am looking now for some new stocks as the valuation of the most of them looks crazy high (at least if you compare that with Polish stock exchange). I have spent significant amount of time on searching and it is not easy now to find companies with good fundamentals and still reasonable price.

The one I'm now considering is Chesapeake and this is where I need some help. It looks like very unique opportunity with significant risk ... but still an opportunity.

Can you please share your thoughts about this company and its current price? 

There is some very optimistic presentation from this company published in Feb but I have limited confidence to this type of presentations

I think this will be an interesting and good discussion while we are in this dip/ correction now is a good time to look at your portfolio and make some purchases for the long term. I have taken this time to rebalance and change my direction i was going. I definitely went way too speculative/ risky and didnt understand exactly what overvalued was till recently. 

For my low risk i truly believe every individual should have DISNEY in their portfolio. I don't see any downside to it. If a pandemic doesnt completely close the Disney parks for good honestly nothing well. They came out of this pandemic way better than they went into it. My only regret is not buying sooner. But i feel confident they are the type of long hold stock that someday my own kids will be buying and selling. 

Medium risk i went with Draftkings. Sports betting is a major industry and states continue to welcome and legalize betting. I chose medium risk cause if states ever decide to not legalize or somehow feds step in the stock absolutely could tank and never recover. But if this continue to open and legalize this really could 2x-4x over the next year or two. 

Square and Paypal in putting as high risk even though i feel they are lower to medium because of their digital money involvement. If the feds ever crackdown on it... it could tank them. However, i dont think they have much downside besides being a tech stock which as we saw tank hard. 

Some positions ive considered adding depending how low they continue to go are NET, CCIV, TESLA, AMAT and PENN.

The whole point is that such things are not as ""well defined"" and so one can't make very good predictions.  This is why it is more risky to invest in such times. You can't make sense of the logic some people buy and sell options at times = risk. Clearly if you could predict it easily it wouldn't be as risky. It is about what people think the future is doing that makes them set their prices at.

SNDL is probably one of the worst cannabis companies currently listed on the market. You should avoid this stock as an investment and the only reason it went up a ton was because of the high volume trading of the stock. Sundial growers in Q4 only had a sales growth of 7.8% when cannabis is suppose to be one of the highest growing industry at the moment. There sales were continuing to stagger 54% year after year ending in September of 2020. There not profitable either even with their small Q4 gains. Now surprisingly Sundial Growers isn't in debt because they have a cash flow of over 550 million dollars (USD). They made all this money with the shares that they continue to throw onto their loyal investors if they have any. They aren't a profitable company and you should stay away from them. Now sense there is all this bad you should sell your SNDL shares and buy puts. As long as your shares are positive.

mbvozq,,StockMarket,post,1616554054,"CEO interview, btcy, biotricityAUSTIN, Texas, March 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SmallCapVoice.com Inc. (“SCV”) announces the availability of a new interview with Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity Inc. (OTCQB: BTCY) (“the Company”), a modern medical technology company delivering disruptive solutions to the multi-billion-dollar cardiac monitoring and diagnostic market.

Biotricity’s flagship Bioflux® product is a wearable medical device that enables physicians to accurately monitor and diagnose cardiac patients in real-time for effective treatment and pain management. While this technology alone targets a massive demographic, the Company’s full pipeline of remote cardiac monitoring and diagnostic solutions provides access to a multi-billion-dollar market hungry for digital innovation.

Speaking with SCV’s Stuart Smith, Dr. Al-Siddiq describes how Biotricity builds and delivers its technology to benefit patients, care providers and the broader healthcare industry, while building long-term value for the Company.

“What we’ve noticed primarily across healthcare, is that technology is owned by clinical players – players that are actually performing the diagnostic tests,” he says. “Our model is very different. We want to enable physicians, hospitals and organizations to do that work so we can stay focused on things of a technology company.”

Biotricity’s monitoring devices are built in-house and are reusable, which saves on costs and enables exponential revenue growth through a recurring technology fee and greater market reach.

“That’s where we have been really fortunate to have a cycle of growth over growth,” explains Dr. Al-Siddiq. “We have a sales force, and the idea is for us to continue to open up more clinics, more hospitals, and get our devices into more hands.”

Biotricity currently has a sales presence in 20 U.S. states. Near-term growth plans include launching more products from the Company’s pipeline and expanding its sales force to target a larger addressable market.

“The most successful medical device and pharma companies have a direct sales force in their key markets and then they have distribution elsewhere,” says Dr. Al-Siddiq. “We are following the exact same track.”

Dr. Al-Siddiq also highlights the experience of Biotricity’s staff and how it was able to leverage that expertise to stride through the challenges of the pandemic and meet demand for remote monitoring.

“Intelligent monitoring and the value of it became very, very clear because of the pandemic,” he says. “The awareness and the need for it increased. The ability to sell was of course limited, but despite that, we were able to grow … Once this pandemic is more under control, I think it’s going to actually crate a boost in our growth in the long term.”

As the Company ramps up its sales force, it is also focused on the release of a new product and uplisting to a national exchange for greater visibility. Of significance, says Dr. Al-Siddiq, is for investors to remember Biotricity’s application to the healthcare industry and how that affects revenues.

“We are a technology company, not a clinical company,” he tells Smith. “Our focus is providing technology to physicians and healthcare companies in a business model that is anchored in reimbursement and a reoccurring revenue model. That is something that creates and accelerated growth and gives us a very high value long term. Being a technology player with a reoccurring business model places us at the top of the food chain when it comes to how to value the company. And we’ve done that in a very specific and concerted way.”",

mbqt8y,,StockMarket,post,1616539081,"$SPCB (SuperCom) poised for parabolic squeeze as Israeli travel trends point to expansion of Government contract from previously reported estimates.SPCB (SuperCom)- Covid Quarantine Technology

Market Cap: $35M

Value of New Contract: $36M/ yr (variable rate, base contract estimate for $3M/ month)

I’ve posted previously about the short squeeze we should see soon in SPCB. That has mostly to do with the massive short interest that MM algos have built up since the pop on great fundamental news, on Friday. (35m shares shorted Friday in a name with ~14m share float). As longs soak and accumulate shares, potential for huge squeeze over $3 increases. All that would need is a further catalyst to spark the fire...

NEW DD:
That catalyst is likely looming in the form of an update, from either SuperCom or the Israeli government, on the actual size of the contract as a result of usage. The contract pays on a unit/ day basis, so expanded usage leads to expanded revenue. The estimate was for a $3M/ month contract for 3 months, with the option to extend to 36 months. This $3M revenue figure is likely based on a 10k unit number, sighted by both the Israeli Government, SuperCom and multiple news sources. These 10k units have already shipped, with 20k more ready to go. Should this scale up toward the 30K units that SPCB has produced for use by the Government as part of this program, monthly revenue could be closer to $9M (market cap is only $30M!!). 

The reason to believe that the order may quickly be increased from 10k units has to do with the immediate travel demand seen in Israel since restrictions were lifted on Sunday. The government raised the cap on travelers going through Ben Gurion Airport to 8,000 per day. On Sunday, 9,000 people passed through the airport, already above expected demand. Bookings on travel sites and the removal of travel restrictions from Egypt, Greece and Cyprus point to further bullishness in Israeli travel, and therefore Israeli quarantine. 

So far the travel restrictions have only been lifted for travelers with an Israeli passport. Once Israel moves forward with a plan for reopening foriegn tourism- a major economic driver and an issue hotly debated leading up to Tuesday’s PM election- the quarantine bracelet program could be expanded as a solution for opening the country to foriegn travelers who were vaccinated outside of Israel. 

Additionally, should new variants prove resistant to the Pfizer vaccine, as some have, Israel could expand home quarantine measures, using the bracelet method in favor of the costly Government run quarantine hotels, that were used heavily during the first wave.

All told, SPCB is undervalued at the given contract rate. With increased units leased and a renewal beyond 3 months, the company would be EXTREMELY undervalued. And I believe update should come soon, given the drivers listed above.


Excerpts and sources below:

“On Wednesday, the Knesset gave final approval to a bill requiring those returning to Israel to self-isolate at home with an electronic bracelet or other technological means.
According to the bill, those who refuse to wear a bracelet, or are unable to isolate themselves at home, will be required to stay at one of the government-run quarantine hotels as an alternative.
Travelers carrying documentation showing they are fully vaccinated in Israel and those who have recovered from the virus can skip quarantine, provided they take a virus test just before the flight and on arrival in the country, and that both tests come back negative.
Those who have been vaccinated abroad must initially enter quarantine but may be released after a test showing they have antibodies, in addition to the two virus tests.”

https://www.timesofisrael.com/8000-israelis-expected-to-arrive-sunday-as-virus-spread-drops-sharply/

“11:45 A.M. Israel approves digital surveillance of all arrivals during quarantine
The Israeli Knesset passed a bill Wednesday allowing digital surveillance of all arrivals to Israel who are mandated to enter coronavirus quarantine. 
Arrivals to Israel who are sent to quarantine in their homes will be equipped with digital tracking bracelets or other digital tracking means, including through cell phones.

The law limits the use of the surveillance data to purposes of enforcement alone and the data can be saved for up to a month.  Anyone who refuses the digital surveillance will be required to enter a state-run quarantine facility.
The law also stipulates that information will be destroyed in real-time, as long as no violations occur. In the case of a breach, the data will be passed on to the relevant authorities. 
While the Health Ministry will be permitted to contact technological companies to produce additional means of digital surveillance, this will be limited to measures which do not ""collect information beyond what is necessary.""

At a Constitution Committee meeting on Thursday, Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kisch estimated that 5,000 digital bracelets will be available for use from this week, and that the around 30,000 more will be acquired over the next three months. (Jonathan Lis)”

https://www.timesofisrael.com/9000-pass-through-ben-gurion-mostly-departures-as-travel-rules-eased/

“The Israeli Knesset has handed the government powers to force all citizens returning to the country to wear a tracking device during their mandatory Covid-19 quarantine, or else be stowed away in a military-run isolation hotel.

Lawmakers passed a bill on Wednesday allowing authorities to mandate the so-called ‘freedom bracelets’ for citizens, after a previous measure requiring quarantine at government-administered hotels expired earlier this month. Now, Israelis will isolate at home by default, so long as they consent to wear the electronic tracking gadget.

Proposed last week, the new law makes exemptions for children under the age of 14 and allows residents to request a waiver from a special committee. Those who decline to wear the bracelet will be required to undergo isolation in one of the quarantine hotels, which will continue to operate. Violators of the isolation rules could be fined up to 5,000 Israeli shekels ($1,500).”

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 broke two-session losing streaks. The Nasdaq logged a second straight session of gains, recovering about half of Thursday’s 3% decline. Tech stocks benefited over the past two sessions from the 10-year Treasury yield retreating from last week’s 14-month high. Tuesday marks one year since the Covid low in the stock market, which ended the fastest bear market ever and ushered in another bull market. The S&P 500 has gained 76% since the March 23, 2020 close of 2,237. Over the past year, two presidents, Congress and the Federal Reserve put extraordinary fiscal and monetary policies in place to support the economy during the pandemic.

> # 2. Yellen, Powell to testify on Capitol Hill on economic recovery

> * Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testify Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee on the economy at 12 p.m. ET. Yellen, who was Powell’s predecessor, said she sees both growth and possibly full employment next year. She credits President Joe Biden’s Covid relief package. For his part, Powell’s prepared remarks struck a cautiously optimism tone, saying the economy is “much improved” but the recovery is “far from complete.” Last week, after its March meeting, the Fed forecasted higher growth and inflation, while saying interest rates will likely remain near zero through 2023.

> # 3. U.S. officials: AstraZeneca may have included outdated data

> * An independent group of U.S. health advisors said Tuesday that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in its Covid vaccine trial results. The questions came one day after the U.K. drug maker said a late-stage trial in U.S. and in Latin America showed 79% efficacy for its two-shot regimen. The Data Safety Monitoring Board expressed concern about whether the material provided by AstraZeneca created an “incomplete view of the efficacy data.” AstraZeneca, which said Monday it planned to file for FDA emergency use authorization next month, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

> # 4. Covid cases rise in parts of U.S. as some states relax restrictions

> * New Covid cases are once again on the rise across more than half of the U.S., as health officials warn about reopening too soon and race to vaccinate more people before highly contagious strains become prevalent in the country. As of Sunday, the seven-day average of new cases rose by 5% or more in 27 states, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Across the U.S., the nation logged an average of 54,308 new cases per day over the past week, a 1% rise from the prior week after months of rapidly declining case numbers.

> # 5. Biden considers $3 trillion package for infrastructure

> * Biden is assembling the next big White House priority, a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That would be on top of his recently signed $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus. The president met privately late Monday with Senate Democrats as Congress has already begun laying the groundwork with legislation for developing roads, hospitals and green energy systems as part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” campaign promise. While the goal is a bipartisan package, Democrats in Congress have signaled a willingness to go it alone if they’re blocked by Republicans.

For  those interested, please look a bit deeper and you can see what orders  are stacked in there closer to the next potential action (ie. nearer  current SP) . .

of course, note  many orders will be edited before execution for many particular reasons,  and thus the top rows of the 'order book' (and maybe others lower down  the lists) can remain in a state of flux , but with most trades that go  through, the 'driver' won't be seen on one or other side of the order  book since when executed they are immediately meeting the offer on the  other side, (can be known as 'icebergs' - coming out of nowhere), thus  without sitting as an indicative order . . so they go through at roughly  the current price, or influencing SP up or down by a step or several  steps depending on size of the trade . .

The  pre-open and closing 'auction' periods are when there is some more  overlap and visibility in the various trading orders and positions  before the auctions end, but there can be rapid changes to the orders,  affecting precise SP estimates until the dust settles after the auctions  . . . the daily closing price is the quoted closing SP, which may or  may not be all that indicative of the day's trading . . . esp. the  volume weighted price etc.

For  some, it's maybe not too hard to manipulate around a 10% spread in the  SP, maybe capping, swamping, teasing the trading action etc, and  maintaining orders near this trading zone for just that purpose etc. .  (not forgetting the Chi-X book too) . .

also  note the way many orders sit there for extended periods, having been  placed at some other time, but now well off the pace, which may come  into effect during big movements up or down.

If  one tries to place a new order too far off the pace, it may not be  accepted, since it is not really 'in the market' near the current SP,  and i guess this policy is meant to disallow the more manipulative  extremes from taking over . . but there's no real way to police the  region of pricing near the SP, which still gives a healthy spread to be  exploited on many stocks, by those traders so inclined . .",

You should go through every position you own and decide what it should be worth in the time frame you want to hold it for.  The time frame you should be looking at is > 1 year or you are probably not investing.  Once you have done that if you think it is a good position that will be worth more in that time frame, hold it and or add to it.  if you can't figure out what it should be worth get rid of it and find something you can put a value on.

mb5emp,,StockMarket,post,1616469763,"CRSR DD**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at it's current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

^(7) [^(https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)](https://hanweiconsulting.com/2020/09/08/a-corsair-valuation-nasdaq-crsr/)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering it's growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

mberlx,,StockMarket,post,1616506240,"2 Hottest Trends - NFTs and eSports together. Fandom Sports - $FDMSF.Website: https://www.fandomesports.com/#/

There are many sports platforms out there where you can gamble on eSports, such as Bet365, Pinnacle, Bovada, etc, however, there has never been a platform strictly dedicated to only gambling on eSports until now with Fandom Sports.

First, **why is eSports such a significant target?**

1. eSports ETF has launched on 3/22/21. Wall Street is starting to realize the long term growth and revenue possibilities in eSports.

2. eSports Audience Growth has increated from 143million viewers to 225million in 2020, and projected for 275million in 2022.

3. In 2019, the Super Bowl had 98 million viewers worldwide, the League of Legends World Championships had 137 million viewers (excluding China).

4. If eSports was its own sports in America, it would rank 3rd behind the NFL and NBA in viewership. Fandom Sports already has signed partnerships from their eSports platform in UK, UAE, and China.

-------------------------------------------

**Fan Engagement**

Fandom Sports will be the only eSports platform that will have ALL the following in iGaming:

1. Dynamic Betting Prepositions

2. Intelligent Odds Creation (Predicting Scores Live)

3. One-Off Tournament Capabilities

4. Dynamic Gaming License

5. Intelligent Analytics

6. Multiple Monetization Options for eSports

7. Online Rosters and Statistics

8. Full eSports Streaming

9. Localized Dynamic App Creation

-------------------------------------------

**NFTs**

NFT stocks have been all the hype, seeing some stocks jump 100% in 2 days.

Fandom Sports is now diving deep in the NFT world as well, being the first in eSports. Fandom Sports has already worked with top earning NFT artists (such as Daniel Mazzone and others), where NFTs will be used as incentives and prizes for the winning teams in eSport tournaments. 

-------------------------------------------

**Stock Information**

1. There is an extremely low float here of $37million on this stock. Every buying order here no matter the amount makes an impact on the price.

2. We have seen steady, healthy increases from $FDMSF on the charts - it still hasnt rocked like the other NTF stocks, and this stock has a bit more to with combining its platform with two big trending industries of eSports and NTFs.

-------------------------------------------

This is a start up company no doubt, but their progress thus far in 2021, shows me an ambitious, dedicated, executive team that are going after all the right targets and getting them done: already completing parternerships in UK, UAE, and China. 

1. Potential partnership with FunJoy in China leads to potential access to an existing userbase of 100m people in China. Advisory board is well connected to propel this company.

This is a long term hold - eSports, and the rise of NFTs are here to stay. Growing big time, and it is just the beginning for Fandom Sports, we can have a potential true money maker here.

Personal Target: $3 by the end of 2021.

Good luck all - **$FDMSF** or **$FDM.CN**",
mbnmy0,,StockMarket,post,1616530344,"$FROG DD - The Only Way to Achieve Fully-Autonomous Driving**JFROG** is in a spot that you rarely ever see: a spot where the market doesn't quite understand what they do. You get the chance to capitalize by understanding.

This is my first real DD post, so I would appreciate feedback and criticism here. I think this company is massively overlooked, and here is why:

**What they do:**

Their main product is **JFrog Artifactory**, a universal repository for software binaries (executable code). It also serves as a mirror repository - it stores local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer **JFrog Xray**, which scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities. **JFrog Pipelines** then puts the pieces together, automating the ""building"" of the software. And the last piece is **JFrog Distribution,** which packages up the finished software package and delivers it to its destination (a piece of hardware, like your car, phone, watch, computer).

As a metaphor, let's use a pizza restaurant. Artifactory is the walk-in fridge, Xray is the health inspector, Pipelines is the chef, and Distribution is the delivery driver. They all work together seamlessly so that you can get your pizza.

**How this ties in with the huge Autonomous Driving market:**

JFrog already has partnerships with all of the big players in autonomous driving -- Tesla, Lucid, BMW, Daimler, Toyota Motors, etc. They actually have an Automotive DevOps conference every year ([https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/](https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/)). **JFrog is the sole reason** that you no longer have to turn your car off to apply an update, it's just done automatically over the air.

I'm going to fit the earlier framework into the framework of Autonomous Driving-

* Developers want to improve the function of their vehicles, so they write fresh new code or pull in a new open-source software package
* The fresh code they write, along with the open-source packages is stored in Artifactory
* The code and open-source packages pulled in need to be scanned for vulnerabilities - this is done with JFrog Xray
* The open-source parts and the fresh written parts need to be combined into a program and tested for errors - this is done with JFrog Pipelines
* The code then needs to be delivered over-the-air to the vehicles, seamlessly - this is done with JFrog Distribution

As the autonomous driving industry grows to over 3 trillion by 2025, this specific use case is going to **explode.**

**Other big growth catalysts:**

You may have heard of the Solarwinds and FireEye data hacks/leaks, described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack or ""dependency confusion"". The toolset JFrog offers is the best thing on the market to combat this kind of threat, and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security. **JFrog's Xray tool won the DevSecOps solution of the year award in 2020** ([https://devopsdozen.com/](https://devopsdozen.com/)), beating out all the tools available on the market by a significant margin. Analyst firm **GigaOm** also placed JFrog Xray as the best tool available, beating out other options from Gitlab and Micro Focus.

With each one of these huge leaks -- CapitalOne, Equifax, etc -- the development industry sees another huge shift towards security, and JFrog is positioned to scoop up all of this business. Side note: CapitalOne always presents at JFrog conferences now, and they're a huge champion for JFrog now that they're using JFrog's solution to plug their security holes.

**Company Background**

Founded in 2008, when they launched Artifactory. There is only one direct competitor with similar scope - Sonatype Nexus. Artifactory is both better and cheaper. Sonatype began as a plugin for Artifactory that worked similarly to Xray before Xray was released -- when Sonatype tried to encroach on the ""Universal Repo"" market, JFrog struck back with the release of Xray and nearly killed Sonatype. Sonatype still exists, hanging on by a thread, passed around from one venture capital company to another.

I've used both of these products over the years and have worked in environments with and without. I can say with conviction that Artifactory improves developer productivity significantly and secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by 80%+ the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Apple, Twitter, Tesla, Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.** These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have a renewal rate of over 90%, with 133% net revenue retention from existing customers **(FYI, this net retention rate is top 10 in the world among SaaS companies).**

They acquired Shippable in 2019 to turn it into JFrog Pipelines, and the CEO has said that they will be using the funds secured via the IPO to continue to do strategic acquisitions. Other acquisitions include Conan, Trainologic, and CloudMunch.

They went public in late 2020 but it was a bit overshadowed, considering they came out the same day as Snowflake.

**Financials**

Comps here are based on the segment they operate in.

DataDog (DDOG) is another development/delivery infrastructure tool mainly centered around performance monitoring which the teams that use JFrog would typically also use. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello, which are used by most software teams for managing development requirements and agile dev team collaboration. They're not exactly a comparable solution, but I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high-growth software company, it's not surprising that their GAAP earnings are negative. What is surprising is that they're very close to profitability, and even had a quarter of profitability last year.  

   * **FROG: -$0.1861**
   * DDOG: -$0.05
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Market cap:  

   * **FROG: $4.9 B**
   * DDOG: $26.3 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Forward P/E Ratio  

   * **FROG: 615**
   * DDOG: 666
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* No long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* GAAP Margin is 81%
* Revenue growing 44% YOY, will probably accelerate with acquisitions

**Ownership**

65% owned by insiders and institutionsMost of that ownership is insiders -- there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Fund, IZRL) that own it. They just bought another huge block of shares a few days ago.Their final lockup release was 03/15 and there weren't really any huge sales, insider ownership has stayed pretty much the same.

**Summary**

JFrog has a great product, and they are uniquely positioned to corner a growing market (that they invented) which has high barriers to entry. They have proven to be forward-thinking and have fantastic financials.

mb4pen,,StockMarket,post,1616467419,"An update on the site I built that combines stock posts across social media For those unfamiliar with this project I basically built a site that takes posts from 24 different subreddits on reddit as well as from thousands of popular investing twitter, YouTube, and tiktok users and places them into one searchable and organized place all the while collecting data on popularity, sentiment, and price movement. Since the official release, I have built tools to help analyze that data and the result are pretty cool if I don't say so myself. Here are some of the features:

**CUSTOM STOCK ALERTS**

You can build your own email alert notifications to find trending stocks based off a range of parameters including; top number of stocks you want to check, social media/subreddits you want to check, time frame you want to check, and what sentiment you want to check. For example: Email me every time a ticker symbol enters the top 10 most talked about tickers across the subreddit(s): [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) and the social media site(s): twitter, tiktok that has not trended over the last 7 day(s) and has bullish sentiment.

**ADVANCED TRENDING**

You can see the trending stocks based off any investing subreddit/social media you choose, as well as pick how many days you want to check (up to 30) and the amount of trending stocks you want to see (up to 50). The site will then return: the amount of posts containing that stock as well as the overall sentiment for all the posts containing that stock. For example: Show me the top 25 most talked about stocks on the subreddits [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/), [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the social media site(s): youtube over the last 24 hours.

**Past Alerts**

Here you see your most recent trending stock alerts including: date/time, price at time of alert, sentiment at time of alert, current price, current sentiment, price change since alert, and sentiment change since the alert. At the top you can also see the overall price % change from alerts with bullish/bearish sentiment. This allows you to see which custom alerts give the best returns and help you build a winning strategy.

**STOCK/SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

This tool takes in a stock ticker and a time frame (1 day, 1 week, or 1 month). The site will then return:

1. The current stats of the stock: current price/price percent change, current sentiment, and amount of posts the stock has appeared in over the past day.
2. The overall change stats: This is the percent change in price, sentiment, and mentions over the time period specific by the user.
3. Day by day analysis: This will show the the day by day statistics of price, sentiment, and mentions over the time period specific by the user.
4. Posts by social media: This will show the total number of posts within the time period specified by the user and what social media those posts came from.

There are a few other features but these are the biggest ones that have the most value in my opinion. This site has grown to be the end all be all of analyzing social media trends and stock prices and has been an extremely fun project to work on. I wanted to share with you all and believe this could serve as useful of a tool for you guys as it has been for me :)

**Not a popular stock on social media**

Adobe is only being mentioned a handful of times per day on social media platforms such as Reddit and StockTwits. But the bullish sentiment is high, currently sitting at 78%.

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, we can see some minor growth with about 20 new followers per day on Facebook and 320 new followers on Instagram.

**Traffic is going up**

Despite the “low interest” on social media, web traffic for Adobe is significantly up. [Adobe.com](http://adobe.com/) had an estimate of 129M visitors in February, up by almost 20% since September last year.

The Adobe Target product is growing in popularity which could be an indicator of growth for Adobe’s Marketing products.

**Customer Satisfaction remains high**

Adobe's Net Promoter Score (NPS) is sitting at 39 (a good score since [NPS](https://www.comparably.com/brands/adobe#nps) is a grade from -100 to 100) with 60% Promoters, 19% Passives, and 21% Detractors. And that number gets even more impressive when longterm clients are surveyed. Clients that have used Adobe’s products for over 10 years gives the company a 67.

**Increase in patents**

Innovation never sleeps at Adobe, at least not if you’re looking at patent fillings. Just in the last quarter, Adobe has added over 200 patents to their portfolio. Now this is on par with companies such as Oracle and Salesforce, but it’s still an impressive number. Some of their latest [patents](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0000796343) focuses on machine learning and neural networks - lots of cool innovative ideas!

**Workforce is growing and employees are satisfied**

According to their SEC filings in 2013, Adobe had 11k employees. Last year, they reportedly had over 22k employees. Impressive growth, and around the same growth as Apple. And it seems like Adobe is not slowing down. Right now they have 1,464 open positions, up from 294 in mid December last year.

Current employees are also satisfied, the average employee rating is 4.4 (out of 5) which would mean a higher employee satisfaction than Oracle and Microsoft. Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen, is getting stellar reviews from the employees, 4.9 out of 5.

The stock might a bit expensive relative to competitors and current earnings, but based on the data, and with [ESG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE/sustainability/) Risk ratings being low and revenue almost doubling in the last four years, I think Adobe has a lot more room to grow and so I add the stock to my portfolio this morning.

Note: This is not financial advice. Do your own DD.

I’m fairly new to dividend trading and I’m wondering when I can sell the stock but still get my dividend?

Here is what the companies saying about the dividend:
“

FIRST DISTRIBUTION
The Board of Directors proposes that the final day for trading in shares entitling shareholders to dividend be set for April 12, 2021, and that the first day of trading in shares excluding rights to dividend be set for April 13, 2021. The recommended record date at Euroclear Sweden for the right to receive dividend will be April 14, 2021. If the AGM votes to approve the Board’s proposals, the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden on April 19, 2021.
“

Does this mean I can sell on the 13th or do I have to wait until the 19th?
Trading via Stockholm stock market if that makes any difference.

I’m expecting after the dividend the stock will drop again so hoping to sell high and buy back at a low between the next dividend.",

mbx510,,wallstreetbets,post,1616559034,"SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.

Think about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**

I have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

“In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.” – Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it’s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren’t. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out:

&#x200B;

[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market, that’s actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.

For example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‘bank participation report’ which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks’ net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

https://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It’s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).

For further evidence of this theme of, “If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall” look no further than the deliveries data itself,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e

You’ll notice that as long as futures investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you’ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.

And lest you think I’m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

https://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

https://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I’m not saying the silver isn’t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.

This is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.

After the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?

Additionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.

Lets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn’t exist, then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?

Let’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.

https://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.

https://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That’s how tight this market is.

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract’s open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f

It looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.

April’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.

Here’s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May:

https://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can’t force them to sell.

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze.

In the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.

But what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?

There are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.

I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.

Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.

So what are these ‘smoke alarms’?

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‘smoke’.

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.

https://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver.

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16

I in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn’t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature’s money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there’s really no reason it must stop there.**

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

https://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

https://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don’t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation’s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).

The other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It’s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

https://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.

**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**

If you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.

mc3o14,,wallstreetbets,post,1616586403,"Ryan Cohen is going to transform GameStop but for now he's limited in what he can doThere will be an Annual Shareholder Meeting in June 2021.  That's where votes on decisions about GME will happen. It might all go exactly as RC wants. If the Board agrees to decisions then big changes can happen then.  If the Board does not agree then the changes Ryan Cohen wants can still happen but not until after the Standstill period ends which would be around March 1, 2022.

[Agreement between GameStop and Ryan Cohen - January 11, 2021 8-K ](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html#a101-gamestopxsettlementag.htm)

**Shares**

As of January 11, 2021  Ryan Cohen owned 9,001,000 shares, or approximately 12.9% of the Common Stock issued.

This percentage matters because when someone owns 15% of GME then they are an ""interested stockholder"" and there are burdensome legal requirements and restrictions on activities between the large shareholder and the company. [The agreement](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html#a101-gamestopxsettlementag.htm) expands the percentage to 20% without triggering this.  In exchange RC is agreeing to not do a hostile takeover.

Note the difference of 12.9% - 9,001,000 shares and 19.9% shares - ~13,930,000 We don't know if or when RC will purchase shares up to this limit.

**Composition of the Board of Directors**

- The Board temporarily increased from 10 to 13 directors, This created three vacancies filled by Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube to fill the resulting vacancies.  The terms expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting probably in June 2021

- Mr. Attal was appointed to the Compensation Committee of the Board, Mr. Cohen was appointed to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and Mr. Grube was appointed to the Audit Committee of the Board,

- Current Board members Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck will not stand for reelection at the Annual Meeting.

- The planned slate of director nominees for the Annual Meeting are: Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aimé, Jim Grube, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner, and Kurt Wolf.

- If a Board member must be replaced during the Standstill Period and RC owns at least 4.0% of the Company’s then-outstanding Common Stock and (y) 2,789,878 shares of Common Stock RC can recommend a person to be on the board (clairfication: to replace RC, Attal, Grube or other Replacement Board members - if needed.  Thanks u/OG_Kushions)

- Ryan Cohen is not accepting any compensation as a Board member

- RC cannot seek, alone or in concert with others, representation on the Board, except as specifically permitted

From u/YouAreAPyrate

- The Slate of Board Members is not definitive. [From the 3/23/21 ER](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109)
 
>As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck. The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.  

**Ryan Cohen agreed to a Standstill Period.**

Standstill Provision

From January 11, 2021 until either 30 days before the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s 2022 annual meeting OR 120 days before the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting whichever is first.  So around March 1, 2022

*Calculation of time* 
If the meeting is June 1, 2022 and the nominations must be submitted 60 days before that April 1 hten the 30 days prior to that would mean March 1, 2022
or 

If the meeting is June 1, 2022 the 120 days before that is March 1.

**Limits on what Ryan Cohen can do during the Standstill Period**

During the Standstill Period, Ryan Cohen cannot:

- nominate or recommend for nomination any person for election at any annual or special meeting of the Company’s stockholders or otherwise seek representation on the Board

- submit, participate in or be the proponent of any proposal for consideration at, or bring any other business before, any annual or special meeting of the Company’s stockholders 

- seek the removal of any member of the Board

- initiate, encourage or participate in any “vote no,” “withhold” or similar campaign with respect to any annual or special meeting of the Company’s stockholders or encourage anyone to do so.

- vote against directors nominated by the Board or recommendations of the Board UNLESS both [Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.](https://www.issgovernance.com/) and [Glass Lewis & Co., LLC](https://www.glasslewis.com/) recommend otherwise, then RC can vote in accordance with the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations; and RC can vote in its sole discretion as to publicly announced proposals relating to a merger, acquisition, disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company that requires a stockholder vote.
- Take over or buy out GME  to own or control more than 19.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock without prior board approval. He also cannot encourage a third party to join in a merger, tender (or exchange) offer, acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring, disposition, business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company.  

- If Ryan Cohen buys more than 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares without prior Board approval, he will be an “interested stockholder” of the Company (normally its 15% ) and be subject to restrictions on any business combination for the next three years 

- cannot form a group or solicit proxies to consent or to vote for the election of individuals to the Board or to approve stockholder proposals, or become a “participant” in any contested “solicitation” for the election of directors

- cannot call a special meeting of Stockholders or make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company, 

- make a request for any stockholder list or other Company books and records



Of course none of this is financial or legal advice. I can read and had some extra time so I wrote this up. Use it however you wish. And if I got anything wrong, let me know.

>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J.

Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


This means that at the annual meeting, 8 of 10 incumbent directors are leaving. Someone else will have to weigh-on on how this impacts voting, because at that point the Cohen's team (Attal, Cohen, and Grube) outnumber the original directors left (Sherman and Wolf), and there will be 4 seats to fill to meet the new limit of 9.",

mbtpwa,,wallstreetbets,post,1616547682,"With regard to the ""they're just defining a short squeeze"" and ""this language is common in SEC filings"" response to the GME 10-K filingHere's the thing about legal filings and CYA turns of phrase- the lawyers who craft these documents do so based on precedent and are encouraged to reuse legal terms as much as possible in order to avoid misinterpretation. Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10-K filings for specific phrases. Let's see just how common this language is, shall we? First, the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety:

&#x200B;

>**The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.**  
>  
>Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  
>  
>  
>  
>**A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.**  
>  
>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.

Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales will occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.

There are eerie similarities between the Volkswagen Squeeze and the GameStop situation.

October, 26, 2008, Porsche announces their extremely high ownership of VW's free float:

""Porsche has decided to make this announcement after it became clear that there are by far more short positions in the market than expected. **The disclosure should give so called short sellers - meaning financial institutions which have betted or are still betting on a falling share price in Volkswagen - the opportunity to settle their relevant positions without rush and without facing major risks.**""

OK. You've made it this far. Does history repeat itself? Yes, it can. Does history rhyme (as in, does it *seem* eerily similar.) Yes, it can.

HERE'S THE RUB \[Hint: It's in the comparison of how they hinted at short sellers\]:

GME:

To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, **investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common** Stock.

VW:

We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled.

Wow did anyone see this? A prediction of what’s to come. It’s in the filed 10K! 
Thoughts and comments please? 

 it's in the 10-K as plain as day.

Speculation on the price of our Class A common stock may involve long and short exposure. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A common Stock available for our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A common Stock for deliver to lenders of our Class

For your convenience, I've copied the author's summary (TLDR) below. It sounds smart, so maybe someone with a curvy brain can explain what it all means.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/19/gamestop-were-the-short-sellers-routed-does-it-matter-beware-the-gamma/?sh=27867674dae9

""Regarding the specifics of the GME event – 

* The “liquidation” of the overdrawn short interest in GME contributed to the January surge, but was not decisive
* The short interest played a minimal role in the February surge, which was a more pure example of the gamma process 

Regarding the broader significance of all this:: 

* The gamma process seems to be quite powerful. The option-cost-to-share-price leverage is real and significant
* The process does not depend strictly on the short interest to fuel the “squeeze”  
* The maneuver may therefore soon be extended to other companies that do not necessarily have a large short interest.""",

This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**


*This indicates four more board members than previously announced are planning on leaving. Additionally, a little further down there is a caveat under the description of the formation of the Strategic Committee that indicates additional senior executive changes may be in the cards:*


>Our Board of Directors has formed a committee of directors called the “Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee” (the Strategic Committee). The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of our operational objectives and corporate strategy, capital allocation priorities and other opportunities for maximizing stockholder value. Our Board, through the Strategic Committee, is currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm to assist it in its evaluation and exploration. **This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of our senior executives.**





*******
`````Updated since some incorrectly believe this is old news`````

Here is the [original section of the 8K filed for the agreement with RC Ventures Jan 11](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) that shows the four additional names listed as leaving today were at that time expected to stand for re-election:


>Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company has agreed to increase the size of its board of directors (the “Board”) by three directors to a total of 13 directors and appoint Alain (Alan) Attal, Ryan Cohen and James (Jim) Grube (the “New Directors”) as members of the Board, each with a term expiring at the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”). The Company has further agreed that, effective at the 2021 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced by four directors to a total of nine directors. The Board will nominate each of the New Directors (or their replacements appointed in accordance with the terms of the Agreement) and **current directors Paul Evans, Reginald Fils-Aimé, George Sherman, William Simon, Carrie Teffner and Kurt Wolf for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting.**

********
Edit 2:
Just spotted another minor change from the same section of the 10-K:

The previous CFO is out as of tomorrow, not the 26th, with the previously mentioned interim CFO picking up his duties until a replacement is announced. Not really new info, just moved the timeframe up 2 days. I wonder if this means there will be a new CFO announcement sooner because his end date moved up, or if it means they are still searching and the interim will be in place for a while.

>Mr. Bell’s cessation as our Chief Financial Officer and Ms. Saadeh-Jajeh’s assumption of the role of interim Chief Financial Officer will occur on March 24, 2021

********
Edit 3:
One last edit because I'm seeing a lot of articles coming out in the media where they lean heavily on the fact that Gamestop retains the ability to issue shares:

From [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under 

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**


>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**


Yes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans.",['MS']

&#x200B;

Even if the rudder was midships, the ship would have veered off to one side. The direction of rotation of the propeller pushes the vessel in one direction or the other. Even if they had lost power, the prop would still be turning for a while.

&#x200B;

   Indian crew of 23. Evergreen are notorious for terrible crew. I wouldn't be at all surprised if some mission critical equipment failed due to poor or lack of maintenance. There are plenty of backups on a ship but you need to really know what you are doing and be able to do it quickly to recover from a major incident.   

&#x200B;

The Suez canal is transmitted by (perhaps unsurprisingly) Suezmax ships at the largest. They for the most part carry Oil Products rather than Crude. So most of the Crude is on its way round the long route anyway. 

&#x200B;

 HOWEVER. Almost all Gas, Petroleum and Diesel will be stuck in that gridlock now. Invest accordingly.   Deviating around Africa will add at least a couple of weeks onto a voyage and charter terminology is pretty restrictive - it's unlikely any ship at the traffic jam will turn around.",['TWTR']

NSCC-801 is the companion amendment to DTC-003, which was recently filed and effective as of March 16th. Here are links to the filing and the notice of filing of NSCC-801.

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-05993.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-05993.pdf)

[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf)

# 🦍💬  What the fuck am I looking at? Words and numbers scare me and opening that link made me have a momentary seizure!

**DTC-003 TL;DR** — “Report your positions on a daily basis. Furthermore, liabilities arising from the misreporting of positions fall solely on the misreporting party.”

**NSCC-801 TL;DR** — “We will use the position reports received via DTC-003 to calculate if it is necessary for you to contribute a supplementary liquidity deposit due to your positional risk. Furthermore, if multiple members have supplemental liquidity obligations in excess of $2B each, we can decide if it’s all on them, or if it should be split up pro rata among all members.”

# 🦍💬  Have mercy! You're hurting my feeble brain meats!

**DTC-003 TA;DR** — “You tell us what’s on your books every day instead of every month. If you lie about it and that lie causes us to lose money, you’re paying the bill.”

**NSCC-801 TA;DR** — “If your positions are retarded enough that you’re at risk of losing so much money it'll fuck us all over, we’ll margin call your ass so fast it’ll make your head spin. If two or more of you assholes were that much of a dipshit, we can make you pay OR we can make everyone in the gang have to chip in. They're going to fucking hate that and they going to want to prevent the possibility of that happening, so they’ll probably turn on your ass.”

# 🦍💬   So, when is this going to happen?

Here are possible outcomes:

* SEC does nothing. It takes effect 60 days from the date of filing.
* SEC approves it. It takes effect whenever the fuck that happens.
* SEC requests additional information. Countdown restarts at 60 days as soon as they receive that info.
* SEC asks for extra time because their brains have grown smoother by the day in the current market environment. They get an extra 60 days.
* SEC objects. It does not take effect. (In my personal opinion, I find this unlikely, as this amendment was clearly written as a companion/follow-up to DTC-003.)

# 🦍💬  Anything I can do while I sit on my ass and wait for this?

The SEC invites interested persons to submit views, data, and arguments for or against NSCC-801. You can submit it by either:

* Using the form at [http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml)
* Emailing them at [rule-comments@sec.gov](mailto:rule-comments@sec.gov) with File Number SR-NSCC-2021-801 in the subject line.

Please don’t fill their mailbox with apespeak and emojis, but making your opinion on NSCC-801 heard is never a bad thing. You are a participant in the market, one who may be affected by this rule if it passes, so your voice matters, and this is an opportunity for the SEC to hear from retail investors, who historically don’t speak up much on these things.

# 🦍💬   Hey asshole! You fucked up your DD!

Please let me know ASAP so I can make the correction. Most of this was written around 2AM CST, so I can't make any promises that I didn't flub one of the details when reading these filings.

# 🦍💬   This is handy info for a chimp like me. Can I have more of this wisdom?

If there is interest in me writing more informative posts in the TA;DR style on market-related subjects including but not limited to implied volatility, options, technical/fundamental analysis, options greeks, or portfolio sizing, please feel free to make requests. I would be happy to write them.

# 🦍💬   This is still too many words! I'm confused and I hate this.

Feel welcome to ask any questions you may have in the comments. I’ll try to get back to everyone to the best of my ability, and I'll add crayon drawings if you really need it.

&#x200B;

So BlackBerry is going to announce their Q4 earnings report next week (3/30).

It has been tough times for BlackBerry since it dropped from $28 down to sub $10. However, I believe there's a good chance that we are in for a nice surprise 🚀

What should we be looking for in the upcoming ER? Well, I made a list below with the things I'm looking forward to.

* Facebook settlement (Not sure if this will be included in this ER. This could be huge)
* Huawei patent sale. This one could turn out to be the most important thing because it could help us to better understand the value of BlackBerry's 38k patent portfolio.
* AtHoc and Spark customer growth.
* IVY updates. Any actual numbers here would be golden.
* Rebranding + ongoing strategy to gain more customers
* Next year guidance of course

The technicals are looking really good and with a good ER, we could be in for some delicious tendies. Currently, BlackBerry is heavily oversold on the hourly, with a lot of room for the MACD to really spike up. We have a strong trendline dating back to November 2020, every time we touched that trendline it bounced straight back up!

Last ER John Chen gave us a little hint regarding the revenue, John Chen is known for being a man of his words!  A $20M beat on revenues before the Huawei patent sale, and without the FB settlement. The picture below is from the last ER (W3 2021).

Right now IV is super low on BlackBerry, which makes it much better! You can buy $11 calls expiring next week for only $0.33 Which's only 13% OTM! Or $10 calls for $0.57 🚀🚀🚀

Here's my thinking. 

PLTR and BB are the two key players in this space right now. PLTR is heavily government focused and expanding to consumer world. 

Big data is already everywhere but is incredibly painful to mine for anything useful. The ability to mine for actionable information is critical to large companies wishing to stay competitive in the marketplace. 

RSI was around 30 this morning indicating this was oversold, as of about noon EDT it was in the mid 30s, still indicating a great buying opportunity. 

PLTR's last demo day popped the underlying to around $45, my planned exit point is $30 to $35 for the click day in April. 

I've decided that I want to put my kids into private school and need to pay off my truck to free up some money for that each month. Working more hours sucks worse than the Wendys dumpster, so I figured I'd YOLO what I could into PLTR and average down as required. What started as a couple hundred shares and with contracts has morphed into this.

mbwwlb,,wallstreetbets,post,1616558212,"Corsair is undervalued and common stock has plenty of fuel for significant CRSR growth.CRSR has 91.9 million outstanding shares, @ $32/share. CRSR has a market cap of $2.9B. In 2020 CRSR had total revenues of $1.7B, and 2021 revenue is  expected to match or exceed 2020’s 55% yearly growth year over year.  This means that Corsair's market cap trades at a modest 1.7x yearly revenue. For reference LOGI had twice the revenue of CRSR at $3.7B in 2021, but has a whopping 6.1x larger market cap $17.87B. Logitech is definitely not an overvalued ticker, and has a history of steady moderate growth. It is in fact Corsair that is drastically and exceedingly **UNDERVALUED**.

Add to this CorsairGaming Inc’s $160 million cash position and on financials alone it’s simple to see why this company is a prime  candidate for continued heavy accumulation. Due to inevitable  exponential growth of product market share and impending increase to appropriate company valuation from current levels, I sincerely believe it is just a matter of time before both institutional investors and opportunistic retail buyers swallow up the few **CRSR** shares available.

To make it even more attractive factor in that CRSR products have a cult like following and are to the PC world the equivalent of what ""Jordans"" are to the sneaker market. *As a heads up I gladly want to share that I currently have holdings of CRSR common stock, this may or may not influence my bias and/or analysis; Anything  herein stated does not constitute nor is intended as professional  financial advice.*

A large majority of the best builds on [r/battlestations](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/) use CRSR products in one way or another. A quick search on Amazon for Corsair products and you can see that:

1. They are very highly rated.
2. They have a lot of reviews.
3. They sell products at better margin than competition.

Customers are willing to pay a premium for certain products or brands, similar to AAPL or LULU buyers don't mind shelling out extra for the cream of the crop. Corsair can be described as a blue ocean millennial stock since  there is no comparable peer competitor that is publicly listed. While long term growth seems a given, there is also optimistic news in the near term.

[CRSR Products](https://preview.redd.it/ki8oyd0ulwo61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=49e633fe5d01c0a06c802edae93bef2c086d6f97)

In the next couple of days Round 3 stimulus money is gonna post to Robinhood accounts and is expected to magnify the Reddit sweetheart stocks (NOK, PLTR, NIO, CRSR, AMD, AMC, BB, TSLA etc.). **CRSR** has a synergistic multiplier as a result of aforementioned stimulus  funds; Stimulus money will be used to purchase both Corsair Shares and Corsair products.

I was excited about Corsair way before it was publicly traded, but extensive due diligence into the company's financials and knowledge of corresponding product market trends facilitates very **Bullish**  speculation. Based on both public facts and personal assumptions, now appears to be a favorable time to dedicate a sizeable long position into  CRSR.

\*Earnings per share estimate was $1.35, the actual was $1.34 - they met expectations.

\*Q4 online sales were up 175% for the quarter, and 191% for the year.  They have already started the pivot to e-commerce.

\*They paid $57 million in debt and still had $635m in cash.

\*They cut operating expenses by 18% in Q4, and 21% for the fiscal year.

But the real value of this stock comes from its future, not its past performance.  If they were killing it, you wouldn't get it at a discount.  You make money by being ahead of Wall Street, and right now Wall Street focuses on old measurements and mature companies.  You only hit it big if you can see what most people can't, or won't see.

I'll admit, it sucked to see the price drop after-hours below my cost.   Let's just say I have a material portion of my net worth in GME.  But ultimately, you either believe in the company or not.  I have 35 years of accounting and executive mgmt - I've studied up on this company.  Considering the success and expertise of the people driving the GME rocket, I'm all in and I'm not folding.  

The gaming industry is bigger than movies and all North American sports - COMBINED, and these are committed customers trust me.  It's like asking an addict if they plan to buy drugs this year.  Duh, they are going to buy more.

When you think about what is on the line for these hedge funds, did you really think they were just going to fold?  Those bastards only win if you quit.  Hold the stock because it's a really good investment, not because it's a short-squeeze opportunity, though that's some nice icing on the top.  Patience, nothing good ever comes easy.

mc0q2m,,wallstreetbets,post,1616574319,"A take on GME's short term futureHello, fellow apes,

I come here with some analysis that I did in my free time because I was intrigued to apply some things that I have learned over the course of time. This is not financial advice, I repeat: **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**. This is merely an analysis I did for fun and I advise you to take it with a grain of salt because I might be very wrong.

Also, I didn't really have the time to make very pretty-looking graphs since I spent most of the time hunting for data and about 20 minutes compiling all this together so please bear with me.

First, let's look at the failure to deliver the GME stock. (Data was taken from the SEC: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm))

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8tfms7p91yo61.png?width=4200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6ec55a6e5052031649dbd4482fe9c252306fc4

We see that most failures to delivers were during mid-January when the stock shot up to about 480 bucks a stock. We also see massive failure to deliver during the period of mid-October, if someone could think about a reason for that, please let me know as well because I can't really think of any right now.

The point I'm trying to make here is that failure to deliver isn't really that bad as of February 26, 2021, with a mere \~300k stocks being failed to deliver on that day. (For context: u/DeepFuckingValue owns 100k of GME stock in his portfolio, also if you're reading this you are a legendary man, I have mad respect for you.)

But does that mean the shorts have covered? Maybe, but it gets better. In the image below you will see a simple ordinary least squares model I ran with the stock price at market close (adjusted\_close) as the independent variable and 3 dependent variables, i.e. Quantity (Fails) which is the number of stocks failed to be delivered, volume\_traded\_in\_millions that is the quantity of stock being traded in millions on that day, and Volume\_of\_Options which is the average options that were in the money on that day.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nl8hd93c1yo61.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba5091c0665c656c12258a0a3648eb90dcdf52b

We see that failure to deliver isn't statistically significant in this OLS model. But the volume of stock traded and the volume of options traded in the money is. If I do not include the volume of options in the model, we see a positive effect of the volume of stock traded on the stock price. This means that for each million that is added to the trade volume, the GME stock price on average goes up by about 70 cents. But as soon as we add the volume of options traded in the money to the model, we see a negative effect with the price of GME dropping on an average by a dollar for every 1 million increase in stock being traded.

This is rather interesting because what it's telling us is that there might be a correlation between the volume of options being traded in the money and the volume of stock being traded. The argument I'm trying to propose is that even though the private enterprises (HF's, IB's whoever it is) shorted the stock, they don't have to deliver a lot of stocks unless some shady shit is going on. BUT, as long as they continue to short the stock or even sell covered calls, and these calls expire in the money, the stock will stay up in price. How up? I don't know, no one does. The more options expire in the money, the more this gamma-squeeze will continue to happen. It may also lead to more failure to deliveries in the future since a lot of stock is held by retail investors.

Only time will tell about contracts expiring in the money, and if these contracts were shorted, well, the shorts are going to have to cover driving the price up due to scarcity in supply and increase in demand.

By the way, the data runs from August 3, 2020 to February 26, 2021 and a snapshot of my data is attached below.

Godspeed to all of you. Good luck! Also, let me know in the comments what you all think and if this is a shit DD. I'm very aware that my analysis may be prone to omitted variable bias and may be complete bullshit so please take this with a grain of salt.

That is all for now!

Regardless of the FINRA short interest report figures, institutional ownership remains far in excess of 100%, being at least 167.96% of the available float as of December 30th (info from Yahoo Finance). The rampant naked shorts have PERMANENTLY created a scenario where this stock is so scarce that at least 70% of owners out there are holding fakes - and likely significantly higher with everything that’s happened since these numbers were reported.

Any excuse for a share recall will create real problems, be it a dividend, a vote, or simply taking them off of the market by switching to a cash account instead of margin.

mbkb9h,,wallstreetbets,post,1616521599,"Gamestop Can Only Go Up&#x200B;

Technical Analysis doesn't mean too much to GME, but it certainly tells us something. I think most of us here can agree that something could certainly happen due to the insanely low volume we have been seeing as well as the Earnings Report coming later today. Here are some a few key indicators why GME can and will go up dramatically soon.

&#x200B;

[1 Hour Technical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/007anng09to61.jpg?width=1895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aff7be90f38ab719c4288d31a1ff33f04b32cd8f)

&#x200B;

1. **RSI -** The first point I'd like to touch on is RSI. As you can see, the RSI is extremely overbought in the bottom left of the chart when GME was making it's comeback from the drop to $40. Now look at the RSI **AT THE SAME PRICE** today and you'll see that we are heading towards being oversold. What does this mean? It's simply an indicator that we are oversold and due a huge price increase.

2. **Trend -** In terms of the month, we have seen insane gains from the $40 price point we were sitting at for weeks. From the start of this chart to the end you can see an upward trend. Now if you look at the first pennant formation indicated by the white lines in the red highlighted area, it's starting to look awful familiar to the current correction we are seeing in the second red highlighted area. The current trend we are in is a Bullish Descending Triangle, much like the Pennant we saw earlier.

3. **Volume -** With GME, when volume goes up, price goes up. If you look at the volume you can see that whenever it dries up, the price tends to skyrocket. Right now volume is extremely low, a sign that people are holding strong and shorters are having a difficult time dropping the price further.

4. **Turning Point -** With the RSI, Trend, and Volume all pointing towards future rapid growth, I'm inclined to believe we will see massive gains soon. I do not see the price dropping below $150 at this point, and the only way I see it getting to that area is MASSIVE short selling to artificially drop the price.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** The technicals point toward GME skyrocketing in the near future. Take this all with a grain of salt though, the price could very well drop below the areas I've mentioned before going up. Above all else **HODL** and the tendies shall come!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE - 3/23/2021 - 6:58 ET:** Looks like the price was driven down after a relatively good earnings report, can't say it was totally unexpected but it certainly threw many of us off. The price was starting to break upwards only to be violently thrown downwards. iborrowdesk shows that 50k shares were borrowed and likely contributed to this selling pressure. [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

The price did bounce off of $150 like previously mentioned after getting down to around 15-20 RSI. They're now in a very oversold territory, but it wouldn't surprise me if they kept trying to artificially lower the price. The shorts aren't going to give up so easily. So **HOOOOODLLLLL** fellow apes.

However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*

&#x200B;

So, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.

""Millionaire"".

Congratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.

Fear.

Slowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!

&#x200B;

*""What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?""*

This guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.

&#x200B;

*""Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?""*

Great question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.

So, without further ado, let us begin.

\-----

# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival

Chapter 1

Protecting it from everyone else

&#x200B;

**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...

**DON'T.**

**TELL.**

**ANYONE.**

This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, “look at Moneybags over here”, “must be nice”, or “remember the little guy”, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You’ll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)

On top of that, they’re gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.

They're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.

By that point, you’ve lost. You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, “no”. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.

There's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.

To put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can’t take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.

*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Protecting it from expenses

&#x200B;

If you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.

*""Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!""* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.

So, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.

Meanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Protecting it from yourself

&#x200B;

Yes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**

Yes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.

\-----

# Part 2 - Economic Survival

Chapter 1

Taxes

&#x200B;

Roughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective ""*ouch*"" from everyone reading.

That's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!

With that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Debt

&#x200B;

If you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.

Now, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

FIRE

&#x200B;

FIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.

Now, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.

This would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:

* **Lean FIRE** \- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year
* **Fat FIRE** \- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)
* **Barista FIRE** \- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.
* **Coast FIRE** \- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Investments

&#x200B;

Before I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...

I believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*

**Stock Market** \- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.

**Real Estate** \- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.

**Businesses** \- ""Small business is the backbone of our economy."" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.

\-----

# Part 3 - What Comes Next?

Chapter 1

Spending

&#x200B;

Alright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!

&#x200B;

Chapter 2

Building a cabinet

&#x200B;

Now, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.

&#x200B;

Chapter 3

Giving

&#x200B;

And now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.

&#x200B;

Chapter 4

Sources for you to perform your own Due Diligence

&#x200B;

In this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!

[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.

*Graham Stephan - YouTube* *:* Graham Stephan is a self-made millionaire who achieved financial independence in his 20's. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)

*Dave Ramsey Show - YouTube* *:* A religious millionaire who hosts a radio show revolving around teaching people how to get out of debt and take control of their personal finances to become (and stay) millionaires. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)

[https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/](https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/) \- A resource for a more detailed description of FIRE.

[Windfall - r/personalfinance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) \- Lots of good resources on advice for people who receive windfalls.

\-----

So there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...

To close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***""The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.""***

Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.

And if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.

Oh who am I kidding. You're the apes on Wall Street! You will all be fine. Just be careful, my friends. As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life.",

the bull case is that the SEC continues to be weak (at best) at chasing down narratively driven EV snake oil salesmen and they continue to spin tales of a chrome future where NKLA is a real company. In that future, current bagholders will be able to sell their stock to people who don't know NKLA isn't a real company.

aside from that, no lol it's just a $0 company that the major players haven't figured out how to take a loss on in an advantageous way (imo).",

mbfm99,,wallstreetbets,post,1616508808,"Sir Isaac Newton secretly wrote about GME, and was a 💎🙌 💪🦍 who gave us a target share priceIsaac Newton is known as being one of the biggest smart smarts in history. 

But did you know he secretly wrote about the GME rocket ship in his work ""*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*"", 297 years before Gamestop was founded?

&#x200B;

That means ***he was even smarter than we thought***, and here's the proof:

&#x200B;

𝕹𝖊𝖜𝖙𝖔𝖓'𝖘 𝕷𝖆𝖜 𝖔𝖋 𝖀𝖓𝖎𝖛𝖊𝖗𝖘𝖆𝖑 𝕲𝖗𝖆𝖛𝖎𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓 (𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓐𝓹𝓮 𝓛𝓪𝔀)

Newton stated that there was a universal law of gravity, and many interpreted his writings as a way to calculate the force of gravity on Earth.

Looking at his equations, they assumed he was speaking of things like mass, radii, and acceleration: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

They took this to mean that the gravitational constant of Earth was 9.8 m/s² and thought that they were the equally smart smarts for understanding Newton's work:

>gₑ = (6.67 \* 10⁻¹¹ N•m²/kg²)(6.0\*10²⁴ kg(/(6.4\*10⁶m)²  
>  
>gₑ = 9.8 m/s²

&#x200B;

However, while this interpretation was heralded as a breakthrough in physics, it was WRONG, and they were actually 𝕭𝖎𝖌 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇 𝕯𝖚𝖒𝖇𝖘 who misunderstood what Newton was saying.

To understand what he really meant by the equation: 

>gₑ = GMₑ/Rₑ²

&#x200B;

We have to do a bit of re-arranging, because he didn't want his secret code to be found out too easily:

>GMₑ= gₑ \* Rₑ²

&#x200B;

Next, we have to change the little ""ₑ's and g's"" to big ""E's and G's"" since Newton wasn't a small minded hedgie:

>GME = GE \* RE²

&#x200B;

See what that says??? [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/) [🤯](https://emojipedia.org/exploding-head/)

&#x200B;

Newton's target price for GME was the price of GE, multiplied by the squared price of Everest Re Group Ltd (Ticker: RE).

&#x200B;

That gives us a target price for GME of:

>GME = $13.01 \*  $243.29²  
>  
>***GME = $770,062***

&#x200B;

So there you have it, Newton's secret code has been given to us. 

&#x200B;

His Law of Universal Gravitation was never about forces that would pull things down to Earth, it was about things that would rocket past the moon  [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

mbq28m,,wallstreetbets,post,1616536979,"GME: My easy to understand and short fundamentals analysis March 24Not a financial advice

I did company valuations before and have gotten pretty accurate estimates. While I’m doing this valuation on GME, I can tell that I like the fundamentals of GameStop. Just think about it:
1) stating the obvious but would any of these senior leadership with massive backgrounds go work in a sinking ship? Of course not. GameStop for the long run
2) the gaming industry is growing on a compound annual growth rate of 11% and no one is positioned to take over that market like GameStop now with all their existing members and experience in the industry
3) e-commerce sales of GameStop accounts for 32% of all sales in just a year. This is insanely good. Reducing the brick and mortar side of business and increasing the online one is how it’s gonna be going forward. And this is all done under the supervision of e-commerce geniuses who built startups from scratch
4) when GameStop closes many of their stores that cost a lot of money per year, they’ll cut down on staffing, rents, and utilities which in turn will reduce their overall costs and increase their margins. They can even reduce margin on consoles and other accessories to the extent where it’s perfect competition with Amazon and ignite that huge used products market. 

It’s late here and I have to sleep but there’s a lot more that makes me believe this company is worth much more than chewy, zalando, and other e-commerce platforms.

**Why Bullish?**

1. Cybersecurity is a hot topic right now. All the stories of hacking in the news keep the topic relevant. 
2. They no longer make devices or phones. They are now a pure software play.  The software sector  is experiencing strong double digit growth. BB’s transformation and earnings should reflect the growth potential.  
3. Leadership: John Chen backed by Prem Watsa – the Warren Buffet of Canada. Need we say more?
4. Five key products in Blackberry's stable 

* QNX: Embedded system Operating System (OS). QNX has the highest certification for security available.  QNX is Device agnostic and can be installed on any Internet of Things (IoT) device, not just cars. 
* QNX Hypervisor: Helps consolidate multiple OSs in a virtual environment. Think of it as Linux environment inside of Windows machine
*  IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles. When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
* Spark: Endpoint management. 
* AtHoc: Non-enterprise communication system targeted at Government, healthcare, education  etc. 
* SecuSUITE: Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication 

**Stay cautiously Bearish**

1. Revenue and Market share: While BB has been transforming, its revenue growth hasn’t yet improved its market-share. 
2. Patent revenue: BB sold a chunk of their patents to Huawei and settled with Facebook. Remember the stock-price jump in January 2021 after the settlement was announced? However, the company didn’t follow up with financial details of the settlement
3. Competitive threat from automakers. A few large automakers like VW have announced their own OS that could reduce demand for QNX. And there are only so many cars being sold in the world. 

**DD beyond earnings** 

BB has been in the limelight this year. It was seen as a “meme stock” ripe for a P&D. All said,  BB is a fundamentally strong but under-valued tech company. [Zacks just upgraded BB. Price Target $29](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldrlmd/zacks_just_upgraded_bb_price_target_29/) 

* Continue to look for details on cash balance (patent settlements should provide a nice bump) 
* Revenue from new and existing partnerships including the recent deal with Amazon.

I am LONG on BB even before it went from $7-8 to 25+ and back. I sold my holdings on the way up at $20 and entered back on the way down at $19/$18.

mbsicz,,wallstreetbets,post,1616544005,"Description of ATM Offerings for confused GME apesPer the title, I'm seeing a lot of confusion regarding what an at-the-market (""ATM"") offering entails, and what the consequences of such an offering would be. Lots of GME apes are seeing the following language (from the 10-K) and are confused/scared:

*In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an ""at the market offering"" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock.* 

Apes are worried the share price will decline, etc., so I thought I'd do a (relatively) brief post to provide some info and hopefully calm some fears. **TLDR at the bottom.**

**First, what is an ATM offering?**

In a sentence, an ATM offering is an offering where the Company issues securities over time directly into an existing trading market at the market price.

**Why do Companies conduct ATM offerings?**

For $$$. Basically, it gives companies the opportunity to raise measured amounts of equity capital over time by allowing a company to tap into the existing secondary market for its shares on an as-and-when-needed basis. 

**How are ATM offerings unique from traditional underwritten follow-on offerings?**

In contrast to traditional underwritten offerings, where a Company issues a fixed # of shares at a fixed price, all at once, in an ATM offering, the Company retains control over the timing and size of each sale.

Sales of the Company’s shares, which can be newly issued “primary” shares and/or “secondary” shares held by existing security holders, are made through one or more registered broker-dealers who act as agents on the issuer’s behalf.

**What are the advantages of an ATM offering?**

**Minimal market impact.**

This is likely the *MOST IMPORTANT* advantage for us apes

Because in an ATM offering program, the securities are sold in small batches over time, the Company can incrementally sell shares into the natural trading flow of the market, without having to market and/or announce the offering. As a result, shares are able to “trickle” into the market, limiting the impact on the issuer’s stock price. Additionally, investors cannot short the issuer’s stock in advance of the offering since the timing of any particular sale is not known.

**Flexibility.**

The timing and size of an ATM offering are at the Company’s discretion, which means the Company can match its capital structure to its ongoing needs. For example, the Company can implement a limit price below which sales will not occur and/or a percentage limitation on daily sales to reduce downward price pressure on its stock, as well as dilution.

**Low Cost.**

The distribution costs for ATM offerings typically are less than for traditional follow-on offerings, and the absence of a company commitment to sell means that there will be no sales below acceptable share prices.

**What are the disadvantages of an ATM offering?**

The main disadvantage is that because ATM offerings tend to be substantially smaller than traditional follow-on offerings, they aren’t as useful to companies trying to raise a large amount of capital.

This disadvantage doesn’t really impact GME nor does it impact us stockholders. In fact, we could read this as a positive in that GME isn’t trying to raise a ton of money right now because they don’t need it!

**TLDR**: Don’t freak out over the fact that GME adopted an ATM program allowing the Company to issue more shares. An ATM Offering is a much more favorable alternative to a traditional underwritten offering and in reality doesn’t impact stock prices in any significant way. If anything, the fact that GME would choose an ATM offering over any other type could mean they’re thinking about us apes ;)

**TLDR to TLDR**: HODL 💎🙌

**Disclaimer**: This is a very scaled-down overview of how ATM offerings work. Do your own research if you’d like to learn more – there are a lot of memos and articles out there with good information.  Also feel free to comment/PM me if you want to correct and/or supplement this post with more info.

**Edit**: Thought I should post my position - holding 88 shares @ average of $97.29.

**Edit 2**: Thought people would read the blurb above taken from the 10-K, which states that the company initiated the ATM offering program in **December 2020**, but it looks like they're not so I wanted to highlight that here. This means the option to have an ATM offering has been around since LAST YEAR. They didn't initiate when the stock price was rocketing up to $400+ and frankly, there's nothing to indicate that they plan on conducting an ATM offering any time soon. See below from the Liquidity & Capital Resources section of their 10-K to help calm your smooth brains some more:
