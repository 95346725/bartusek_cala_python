I am new to this. I got in at the peak as well (like some of you). I was up 20% in Feb, but now down to maybe 2% up if that ( I don’t want to check).

I am in it for the long. I still panicked, and made some changes, selling at a loss and rebuying to diversify my profile a bit. 

I think what would be helpful is to hear from people who were in this in the past , how they handled it and how they got out of the rut.

I am also convinced the so called analysts on TV don’t know jack. Even Cramer... (as an example , 2 weeks ago he was saying PLTR was a good buy at the dip, now he is saying it’s too expensive... I mean seriously)

I’ve got my eyes on Tesla which I don’t own any of, although there are many other stocks I want to get in on. Are you holding out until this volatility passes? It seems very possible we could plunge deeper, or equally as likely to shoot back up 20% in a day. 

I’m in the edge of deciding whether to hoard cash for a few months or keep buying in until I’m broke. Indices like the NASDAQ are making moves above 1% daily yet the VIX somehow is going down. What are your plays? Any really cheap stocks that have been beaten down more than they deserve? 

I currently own AAPL, PLTR, NIO, XPENG, VACQ, ARKF, ARKG and am down significantly. Sure the recovery stocks may have a 10% upside at the moment but long term, they are stagnant and can’t expect much growth from them if they don’t drastically change their business plans.","['NDAQ', 'TSLA', 'AAPL']"

mcwq5a,,stocks,post,1616674115,"$TSM - Fundamental Analysis - Still The King vs INTEL?**Hey there investors! In this post I am going to share with you my Due Diligence on the biggest semiconductor foundry in the world, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company!**

**\[Very Long Post\]**

# What’s the story of the company?

[TSM](https://imgur.com/0IJCk3R) is the biggest chip foundry to provide 7 & 5 nanometer chips that became very popular after Apple moved their chip design in-house. Apple isn’t the only company that works with TSM with other big names like AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Qualcomm and even companies that also build their own chips like INTEL & NXP use TSM do increase their capacity.

Late last year the company also received approval to build a $12B chip plant in Phoenix, which will be a welcomed by the US, as chip demand has far outpaced the supply currently available around the world.

I know it might sound weird, but guys, in my opinion, I believe this $500B [company](https://imgur.com/gMPb0Pb) which has risen by more than 150% in the last year after the 2020 lows, still has some room to grow 

# Competition & Product 

I believe that TSM has a great advantage compared to companies that operate in their industry, as they have invested huge amounts of money in capital expenditures to gain competitive advantages compared to Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Broadcom & others.

We can also take a look at what Seeking Alpha Quant Factor [grades](https://imgur.com/KIQyCtO) the company, and we can see that TSM does pretty good in all 5 categories, Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum & EPS Revisions.

One other thing we can see here, is that after the huge spike in price, the dividend yield of the company still has room to recover, as the 4-year average yields stands at over 3%, second only to Qualcomm

# MOAT – Easy to replicate? Branding value? Dominance over Marketplace? TAM?

You are also probably wondering what is the MOAT of the company? Do they have a branding value or some kind of dominance over the Marketplace?

Well, from my point of view, TSM has a significant MOAT against most of its competition as they’ve been able to collect huge amounts of knowledge from its diverse base of over 500 customers which have helped them leap ahead of other companies since the 7NM move in 2018.

TSM pretty much [supplies](https://imgur.com/l5ekttM) all the big companies I mentioned earlier which later pass on the technology to their customers, so it’s very likely that you are using one of their chips in some of your devices, maybe your iPhone, your car, computer or anything else.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/M9MMUfn), the MOAT TSM has over Intel, as Intel is still a long way back, working on older generation chips, while TSM is leading the pack.

I believe their market dominance in the 7NM & 5NM chips will continue to keep TSM as the preferred manufactured for most fabless companies just like Apple which currently [represents](https://imgur.com/TkAR5kR) over 20% of TSM revenues, it seems to me that TSM is the best foundry to own for the next decade, as the worldwide revenue of semis [topped](https://imgur.com/X9iqLlY) $40B to start 2021, with [TSM](https://imgur.com/3unNxtB) being the only one of its pears to see a significant growth, with a big chunk of that coming from the huge demand Apple will provide them for the 5NM chips, which accounts for over 50% of their 5NM [sales](https://imgur.com/OyfFsEN).

Friends, this is just my opinion, but I even dare to say that their total addressable market it’s pretty much limitless in the foreseeable future.

Semiconductors are here to stay as technology will only continue to evolve, with smaller & smaller chips in the future and competitors still struggling to catch up with the 5NM technology that TSM already has, so TSM should be poised to remain one of the biggest companies in the world for the foreseeable future

I believe now is the time we need to get to some of the company’s financials & metrics

# Company Growth & Balance Sheet

Revenue/ Net Income Growth? Profitability?

Let’s start by taking a [look](https://imgur.com/mvUGLnO) at how the companies revenues and gross profit have evolved in the past years, and we can see that with the exception of 2018, TSM has seen a continued growth with 2020 being a booming year as gross profit increased by more than 50% with operating income also increasing by more than 60%, which in my eyes is pretty remarkable given the size of the company.

[TSM](https://imgur.com/jHWdJrY) has managed to post a positive net income in the last 10 years, seeing an increase of over 400% in that same period, so, I hold the opinion that this will continue on the same path for the next 10 years as well 

# Cash / Debt / Net Debt & Dilution

Looking at the balance [sheet](https://imgur.com/MUCFRtx) of the company, we also find that TSM has an excellent financial situation, with over $38B in current assets, which can easily pay off the $22B in current liabilities or the $32B in total current & long-term [liabilities](https://imgur.com/kE1mKDV), so the company is way more than solvent.

# Lastest Earnings Reports & Predictions of Revenue Streams / Cost of Sales & Others

It seems to me that TSM [posted](https://imgur.com/mmqloyJ) some terrific numbers yet again in Q4 of 2020, delivering almost $13B in revenues up 22% YoY with 5NM technology already accounting for 20% of wafer revenue as the 5G technology and super-cycle is just starting, with telecom companies struggling to keep up with the increasing demand.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/ZGM9b2N) that the 5NM was already the 2nd biggest revenue stream for the company in the 4th quarter and I would say that it’s pretty likely only going to increase, as this only accounted for 8% of 2020’s [revenues](https://imgur.com/RJmakFU), especially as Smartphone [account](https://imgur.com/B7UHPHO) for almost half of TSM revenues from last year, with only the automotive sector seeing a small decline, which was expected, but should recover in the next years, as cars had a bad year given the events of 2020 and they will also very likely contain more & more chips as companies continue to innovate.

TSM also provided a revenue guidance similar to last quarter as gross profit margins are still expected to come in at over 50% 

# Dividends?

One last thing that we should look at before moving on to future projections is how the company is continuing to growth their [dividend](https://imgur.com/Kxhyy2b). 

As far as I am concerned, dividend investing is not really my favorite but this is an important thing to look at when looking for companies to buy to maintain a balanced portfolio.

TSM only offers a $1.79 dividend but this has seen a 13.5% growth rate in the past 5 years and given that things are only getting better, I think this can continue as well.

I guess now’s the time to move on to what is the current upside and the long-term potential for TSM

# Current Upside / Long Term Upside?

First, let’s start with my [expectations](https://imgur.com/r87yUGF) of the revenue streams, costs of goods, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

I believe we can continue to see a steady growth in their total sales, that will end up doubling by 2025, reaching over $108B. On the other side, I also believe we can continue to see a gross margin of 54%, similar with what we saw last quarter.

The other operating expenses from R&D and SG&A I pretty much expect to remain the same, as this has been steady over the years, so, a 2.7% of the revenues should go in SG&A and 8.3% should continue to go into continued R&D to keep the companies MOAT.

I would say that TSM is very likely to continue to invest a lot of money in Capex to keep up with the increasing semiconductors demand, so this should continue to grow at around 2.5%/year.

All of these numbers should get us an operating income of almost $27B for 2025, though, there are other things like interest income & expenses that we should account for, but for TSM, this should add up to a slight gain of $400M in 2025.

Finally the effective tax rate of the [company](https://imgur.com/pkOEifS), has stood under 12% for the last 3 years, but, for safety reasons I will imply a small increase each year, which would [result](https://imgur.com/KbtxhZG) in TSM having a net income of just over $24B in 2025, paying out a dividend of $3.24, while also not diluting their shares, as TSM hasn’t [diluted](https://imgur.com/oflEVtF) their stock significantly since 2005.

# Price to Earnings (PE) Valuation

PE Valuations are my favorite way to quickly & pretty accurately determine reasonable future prices for stocks. 

Taking into account all the numbers we went through earlier, my [view](https://imgur.com/gwgvpXI) is that we can see TSM trading anywhere between a 25 and a 40 PE by 2025, which given the $4.64 EPS for 2025 would mean the stock can trade between $116 and $185, but, before moving on to the final price targets let’s also take a quick look at TSM discounted free cash flow valuation.

# DCF 

I [implied](https://imgur.com/hNWP9E2) the same growth rate for TSM revenues and actually lowered their EBIT as a % of their revenues each year by .5%, and after taking into account their effective tax rate, their D&A, capital expenditures and net working capital I arrived at a $71.5B free cash flow by 2025.

As always I also added their net assets and used a 3% long-term growth rate just to be conservative and for the perpetuity approach we got a price target of $86, meaning the company is potentially overvalued at the moment, though, on the other hand, the EBITDA approach, using a 20x multiplier, would results in a price target of $178. 

I like to use an average approach of this numbers, which would results in a price target of $132, or a 21% upside in the next 12 months for the company, not including any additional dividends received.

# Technical Chart

Looking at a short-term [chart](https://imgur.com/qgvPpXM), we find that TSM is pretty underbought right now with an RSI of 36, but the volumes in the stock are slightly increasing.

It seems to me that the next support level for TSM stands at $103 while the next resistance is just above my 12-month price target for the company, as TSM had a fake breakout over $135 in the middle of last month.

# Wall St. Opinion

I always take a look after I’ve finished my DD to what analysts say, and in this case, they have a $137 PT for the [company](https://imgur.com/xAVfqN4) slightly higher than my own DD, so it seems I was pretty accurate with my expectations.

[Analysts](https://imgur.com/l6EndWo) also expect a 72B on average, while my estimates are the top end of their range, but on the other hand, I only have an EPS of 4.64$ in 2025, compared to $5.6 expected by them by 2023.

# Weaknesses

When looking at what companies you should invest in, it’s recommended to also take into account their potential weaknesses.

I have no doubt that TSM does have some weaknesses, but probably the biggest one is that they really so much on their Apple revenues, though, it’s hard to believe Apple will move away from TSM anytime soon, or even if that happens that TSM won’t find other customers in need of their products in a short period of time, especially now with the huge worldwide chip shortage.

While writing this post, we also received [news](https://imgur.com/MCjAWXZ) from INTEL that they are planning on building 2 new foundries in Arizona. This might provide even more pressure on the current price of TSM, but, in my humble opinion, i think this just more buzz, with Intel still laggining behind in technology, not even having the 7NM available, while TSM is already working on 2 & 3NM developments. So, i'd take this as another opportunity to ""buy the dip""

# Short Selling? Institutional Holding?

The company has such a solid future that the percentage of [shares](https://imgur.com/wl06zGs) sold on the short side is under .3%, which is one of the lowest I have ever seen in a company.

Though, on the other hand, the stock isn’t that largely [owned](https://imgur.com/ndoKXcs) by institutions, with JP Morgan leading the pack with under 1%, buy, my guess is that’s because this isn’t a US based company, which does make it less attractive to big investment banks & funds.

I bet that you are just waiting to see the final price targets and my final opinion, so let’s jump to that right now

# Final Opinion & Prediction!

In my [opinion](https://imgur.com/P7OQKtb), TSM is a must have stock in most portfolios, brining some balance, with good growth ahead of it. TSM might helped lower the beta of most portfolios that are way to heavy on the overhyped tech stocks right now.

Remember, this is just my humble opinion as a retail investor, this is not an investment advice, but my view is that we can see TSM moving towards the $132 range by early next year, with TSM likely to be jump-started again around their next [earnings](https://imgur.com/ClXzJZG) report in April 

Regarding the long-term [view](https://imgur.com/dgQTLy7), my base TSM target is $150 by 2025, meaning an ROI of 38% which is not that great, but when taking into account the expected dividends received from TSM, that can jump to over 50% 

Speaking personally, my 2025 Price [Targets](https://imgur.com/9ZWdcb5) for TSM range from an average of the 25 & 30 PE multiple, my base case from the 30 & 35, while my bull case averages de 35 & 40 PE multiple prices.

mczt4d,,stocks,post,1616683320,"$FNKO – Their Future of Margin and Revenue Expansion**TLDR** (posting at the top since this is a long post and I am occasionally a nice guy): FNKO sees the future of the collectibles market and is preparing for it. The company will see much better margins and likely a higher multiple as they become more tech-driven, which should make the stock go up to reflect their pivot. I believe the margin of safety is solid while the potential upside is very high, thus giving this an excellent risk/reward profile.

If you have ventured into your local GME store or visited their website then you are likely aware of or even potentially a fan of Funko’s products. FNKO obtains licenses from well-known franchises including movies, sports teams, comics and more in order to make their very recognizable and unique collectibles as well as apparel, games, and accessories.

Before talking about the future, let us look at the present. Their last quarter was fantastic, here are some of what I consider are the key things to be aware of:

* Net sales increased 6% to $226.5 million
* Gross margin increased to 37.2%
* Cash flow from operations increased 69% to $46.9 million
* Net sales of non-figure products grew 30% compared to 2019, primarily driven by strength within its Loungefly branded products which increased 51% in the quarter
* Funko's direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to prior year driven by continued strong demand on its e-commerce sites
* 68% of sales were attributable to evergreen content

**Here is my interpretation of the points above:** Sales are up and direct-to-consumer is a growing share of their sales as well as ‘evergreen’ content which essentially represents their products that are not tied to fleeting events. Additionally, they are growing revenues in product areas outside of the collectible figurines that they are known best for. The business as it exists today is healthy, which gives us a positive outlook for the future as it is as well as a good margin of safety for the stock price because of this since it appears to have a trajectory towards continued success and stockholder returns.

**But we are here for the big wins, now aren’t we? Let me pose a few questions:**

*If you wanted to take a healthy company with a loyal fanbase and have it earn more money without straying from what makes the company successful in the first place, what would you do?*

I would say that you would try to delight your customer base with new options to choose from to keep them happy and boost revenues while also doing what you can to not let those new options turn inventory management into a nightmare.

*If you had a company that made its money from physical products, what would you do?*

The way to make more money from physical products is to increase margins by cutting manufacturing and/or selling costs or by increasing prices.

*Who are FNKO’s primary customer types and what are some key characteristics of those customers?*

FNKO has a mix of customer types from people who like specific products that relate to a specific license to collectors who build complete collections of products to either keep or sell for a higher price. For either type of customer, I’d say FNKO is quite able to encourage multiple purchases over time (seriously, I haven’t seen an owner of a FNKO product only own one FNKO product) but the collectors are who I want to focus on for this post. Collectors want to build and complete collections, so if they are passionate about doing so with FNKO products, it would behoove FNKO to provide new ways of doing so in a way that makes it easier to verify and trade those collections if desired.

*Bro, what the fuck. Are you ever going to get to the fucking point?*

Now that I have shared the key things that I think is important to the environment FNKO is in today, I can now share what I believe will make FNKO rapidly grow their earnings: **NFTs**

*The fuck is a NFT?*

I think of NFTs as digital collectibles with built-in verification systems. These verification systems are essentially digital receipts that use blockchain technology to make forgeries more difficult and reduces the time it takes to check the legitimacy of a collectible when exchanges are desired. These are built into the collectibles themselves. For collectors, this is big. NFTs are still not very mainstream but amongst the collector community, I think these will be the future and will become extremely relevant. I personally do not collect things myself but it doesn’t take more than a couple brain cells to realize that collectors would want it to be as easy as possible to know that what they are buying is legit and as easy as possible to show people that what they are selling is legit. NFTs enable this to be done much more easily and quickly, leading to less fraud and a less painful experience for those who are into building/trading collections.

*How would NFTs help FNKO?*

As briefly discussed above I would say that if you want to improve upon an already-successful business, you would want to keep your customers happy while expanding margins and opening new revenue possibilities.

If FNKO begins to tie NFTs to limited-run physical items or sells limited numbers of the NFTs themselves, they could create a win-win for both themselves and the segment of their customer base that likes to collect, while also pulling in new customers who see a well-known company with well-known licenses creating content to collect and trade. With NFTs, FNKO can delight customers with new ways to collect while also streamlining the experience and solving some of the issues that make collecting difficult (verifying goods and trading them).

For FNKO, items tied to NFTs can be sold for more money which increases their margins since digital goods do not cost as much to build and scale (that is why tech companies trade at high P/S and P/E multiples). Because items are digital, it becomes easier for FNKO to react to trends in what customers want and can create limited release items and sell the NFTs right away and build/ship the physical items at a later date. Hell, they could also become a middleman between collectors and hold the physical items on behalf of whoever owns the NFTs and deliver at the request of the NFT owner (while picking up storage fees along the way for saving the NFT owners the trouble of holding/shipping the physical product while they wait to trade the NFT to a buyer. I do not know exactly how FNKO will implement NFTs into their business but you can see that some massive potential for fantastic customer/business win-win scenarios exists.

**Conclusion:** Because FNKO has a healthy business today, I believe that it has an excellent risk/reward profile because even if they totally botched the NFT rollout their existing business will be fine. I think NFTs provide a very enticing opportunity for the business to keep current customers happy, bring in new collector-customers, and increase margins while increasing revenues which would logically make the stock price go up due to both better earnings per share and a more tech-related multiple on those earnings.

*Is FNKO even planning on using NFTs?*

You’re damn right they are: [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html)

*Are there other NFT-related stocks?*

Yes, but most of them are just penny-stock garbage and none of them to date have a combination of track record plus logical business sense anywhere close to FNKO.

**Disclosures:** I am not a financial advisor, I’m just an everyday idiot like everyone else here. The only difference is that I drink so much coffee that I occasionally become a functioning human. I am long shares, 4/16 20c and 25c as well as some 11/19 20c. I personally consider $50 my minimum target (both because I firmly believe it plus it is a lucky number for me since I had the same minimum PT for GME back when it was below $20). I have no idea what the ceiling is, but I just know that NFTs have way too much synergy with the existing business for me to ignore. I like this stock, my opinions are my own and I should probably be ignored because I ran out of coffee halfway through writing this.

Good luck to all, please have some semblance of logic with your plays if you decide to pick up some FNKO positions.",

mcoy9k,,stocks,post,1616643355,"Be careful with what you read on r/stocksYikes.....That’s all I gotta say. 


It’s been noticeable that the quality of posts and comments have gone down with the influx of novice investors. It’s due to a lack of experience, however thanks to the Dunning-Kruger Effect these people often feel superior to seasoned investors....including Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and academics. 


It used to be that I’d come across down right nonsensical (worse than bad) posts or comments every other week. However in the past month that number has increased to once every other day....and sorry but it mostly comes from the dividend investing crowd and the TSLA fan-Boiz. 


Edit: Apparently I need to explain this to the TSLA fan-boiz. First, I’m not saying Cathie is dumb, where in this post do you see her name? Second, I’m mostly referring to the boiz who say “I’m new to investing and I already made ____ in profit with TSLA (or other meme stock), you just don’t know how to invest.” 


Today I was trying to explain to someone what Dividend irrelevance theory is...and somehow this person determined that you can have a 13% “guaranteed” rate of return no matter what the stock price does; meaning the stock can crash 90% and your rate of return is still +13% or more for the year. Well turns out this guy calculates his rate of return by the number of shares bought buy his DRIP per stock....rather than growth/loss in the value of your investments. And ofc he felt like he cracked the investing code of ancient wisdom that us plebs don’t know. So his idea was to buy high yield stocks, hold on and never sell....according to this user it was impossible to lose money with a dividend stock because it always pays a dividend.....I think this takes the cake for worst advice/logic I’ve seen on this sub and that’s saying a lot. 


So I think it’s a great time to remind people. Be careful whom you take advice from. Especially on Reddit and YouTube. There’s a few users out there that are good, but the majority don’t know what they’re doing half the time.",['TSLA']
mcoy9k,gs5gyo3,stocks,comment,1616664055,"You should be careful with what everyone says. This is why rhetorical thinking matters. People are very biased and will try to convince you into thinking in a way that best suits there own agendas. The color of the candles are forms of manipulation. Stocks imo are a big psychological game.

Wanna know my recent example? With the Chinese delisting fears once again being brought up. My friends who are NIO bulls will say the SEC delisting fears are nonsense. Then my same friend will sell and try to time the bottom and try to create fear by making a big deal about it. But once he buys back into the stock he goes around saying it's no longer an issue and it's just ""noise"". 

Another example is all these articles being posted. This is why I always want to know where investors are coming from. I wish there was more transparency. I don't use WSB like I did years ago. But I loved the ""position or ban"" rule. Then you can see why someone is bullish or bearish on a stock. It makes much more sense why someone says certain things.

mc91ew,,stocks,post,1616600802,"Motley Fool and many other financial news sites are SEO plays.They are not designed so that one makes goods decisions.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-march-25.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures turn lower after Fed chief Powell comments

> * U.S. stock futures turned lower Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition” that Covid economic stimulus and vaccinations allowed the U.S. economy to recover faster than expected and that central bankers, at some point, may be able to pull back emergency support.

> * Late-day selling reversed gains and dragged the S&P 500 down 0.6% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped lower in the final seconds of Wednesday’s session. The Nasdaq dropped 2% after a slightly higher open gave way to a day of selling. Tech stocks were lower despite the 10-year Treasury yield holding below recent a 14-month high as a market rotation out of high-flying growth names continued. The Nasdaq last closed at a record last month. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs last week.

> * The Labor Department is set to report its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the stock market opens. Economists expect 735,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down 35,000 from the prior week, which saw an unexpected jump even as many states relaxed Covid mitigation restrictions on businesses.

*****

> # 2. AstraZeneca revises Covid vaccine data with lower efficacy rate

> * AstraZeneca late Wednesday issued updated Covid vaccine numbers from its late-stage trial in the U.S. and Latin America after U.S. health officials earlier this week questioned the accuracy of preliminary data. The U.K.-based drug giant now said its vaccine is 76% effective in protecting against symptomatic cases of virus. A release issued on Monday reported an efficacy rate of 79%. AstraZeneca reiterated its two-shot regimen was “well tolerated” among participants and no safety concerns were identified.

*****

> # 3. Biden to hold first news conference of presidency

> * The White House announced Thursday that it’s dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural communities. More than 25% of the entire U.S. population received at least one vaccine dose, including 14% who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two shots, while Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is only one shot.

> * Against the backdrop of rising Covid cases in many states and more than 30 million total U.S. infections, President Joe Biden is set to hold his first news conference. He’s expected to point to a surge in vaccinations, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the latest sweeping stimulus package. He’s also likely to face a wide range of questions from U.S.-Mexico border security to gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia.

*****

> # 4. Oil prices slide as Covid concerns outweigh Suez Canal disruptions

> * Oil prices fell Thursday as fuel demand concerns re-emerged alongside worries about steps back in the global fight against Covid. Prices of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude and the Brent international benchmark each dropped roughly 2%, one day after they both surged nearly 6% on the crude shipping disruptions caused by the grounding of a giant container ship in the Suez Canal, a major trade route. It could “take weeks” to clear, according to the CEO of a Dutch company helping with the salvage efforts.

> # 5. Lawmakers to press tech CEOs over speech, misinformation

> * Big Tech leaders Thursday are scheduled to testify at a virtual House panel hearing on efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns Google and YouTube, will face increased pressure following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the rise in Covid vaccine misinformation. There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted online.

So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.",

Apple has retraced every single ATH gap up that I can remember since 2007ish. Apple has had plenty of gap ups, but the concerning ones are gap ups that take the stock to an ATH.

Yes, 300 residents (homes) which equals about $60,000 per house which is a marvel in Austin, TX.",['AMP']

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

mcx8tv,,stocks,post,1616675865,"Coinbase IPO 

I think everyone at this point knows that Coinbase will be going public and there is a lot of interest in getting in on the action before they actually go public.

There is actually a german based crypto exchange FTX that allows you to create a smart contract which will be tied to fractional equivalents of the Coinbase stock once it goes live. So that is how people are already buying / trading the Coinbase stock. 

As of today these contracts are going for about $404 giving Coinbase a valuation of around $70B. o.O

I know this is confusing for a lot of people not familiar with the crypto world and if you live in America you are technically not even allowed to buy in on these contracts.

So here is another way to get in on the Coinbase stocks early

Cathie Wood the founder and CEO of ARK investments is known to be a bull on Crypto and especiallly Bitcoin.

One of the funds that ARK controls is their ARKF or ARK Fintech.

I think it is a very fair assumption that once Coinbase IPO's that this fund will be picking up a large cache of Coinbase stock.

So if you want to get in on Coinbase early I suggest you load up on ARKF it is a safe bet to get in early on Coinbase without having to mess around with smart contracts. Get in while the price is right!",

mcx8tv,gs64jqe,stocks,comment,1616680098,"Mostly I trade crypto in America.  The in America part is one of the reasons I am not interested in coinbase stock.  Because it is so over regulated, great cryptos are not listed on coinbase until much much later, if at all.  American investors in crypto often have to jump through hoops to be able to get cryptos that are not listed yet on American exchanges.    I've been annoyed particularly at coinbase for not listing Theta token before it was 1 USD , therefore taking the opportunity away from investors in America to benefit from a tech based in America. While people across the globe had access, over regulation shut it's own country out.",

Now I'm in a really confused place, 2-3 month ago during the tech all time high, I was reading how tech is the future, all those analysts giving price targets (example NIO, I saw a lot of price targets to 70-80$). I was reading how Palantir is the future of data analysis, and how it signing big contracts, I was reading how Biden will push renewables, and that renewables are the future, solar, fuel cells act.. Now over night, I'm reading how tech is overpriced, SPACs are in a bubble, you most rotate to value stocks, Palantir earnings are decreeaimg making bigger loses, workhorse is fake company, and lost a big contract. NIO is at a risk of being delisted because it's a Chinese company (like we didn't know this before), chip shortage will slow down the production ect..I feel like I'm being manipulated by all that news and lied.

I am familiar with the wash sale rule. The wash sale rule affects your cost basis when you buy a security you recently sold if you had originally sold at a loss. It doesn't affect whether or not you can claim a loss once the security is sold, it affects how your gain/loss is calculated.

If you buy at $100 and sell at $50, you've recorded a $50 loss. If you buy back in at $45 a week later, the $50 is added to your cost basis and the loss can't be claimed because it's accounted for in your cost basis. Instead of a $45 cost basis, you have a $95 cost basis. If you sell at $50 again, your new result is a loss of $45 and this can be claimed for tax purposes. If you buy back in though the whole process repeats.",

md20ir,,stocks,post,1616689090,"WMT DD best stock in my portfolio?\*disclaimer: this is my first DD... I'm taking time out of my office job to hear thoughts about my analysis.

Looking at my portfolio that I built in the past 4 months, WMT seems like the most undervalued stock.

I am not talking about any get rich quick stocks. Looking at you TSLA, PLTR, NIO, GME. (although I am invested $20k in these stocks and am about 20% down)

# 1. Why it will win in the next few years

The market volatility is here. We don't know if it's going to stay, but I am unsure about investing heavily in tech. I want a company that can weather the storm. Grocery/food retailer, especially low-cost chain, seems like a great place to invest in since their business model will bring even more customers in challenging times. The $1400 stimie is a boost that will flow into this sector while we move past the pandemic. 'WIN' here doesn't mean doubling stock price in the next few years. 'WIN' is beating the market. My goal is 4%+ annual.

# 2. On-line business model

Let's be frank here. Walmart doesn't have the greatest online presence. They are trying their best with Walmart+, but it's not there yet. Good news is that I don't think their online presence is 'priced-in', which means that the current valuation of the company doesn't account for how big it can actually get. The company still makes great revenue and margin in the space and there's room for growth.

# 3. Current valuation

The stock is currently down about 10% since the ATH (all time high) in Dec 2020. Not gonna lie, grocery stores did get a boost during the pandemic since a lot of people cooked more meals at home, but look at the 50 day moving average. The stock moved higher faster than anticipated, but it's trending well with the average line in the right direction. In the past 5 years, the stock has dipped below 50-day moving average a very few times.

While we are at it, let's look at some of the fundamentals:

PE: 28.14

PS: 0.67

PB: 4.66

These are some of the lowest number I see in my portfolio right now.

# 4. Is there a bear case?

From what I can see, very little. If WMT is down, I am pretty sure the whole market will be down. I also don't foresee them making poor business decisions in the coming future that will cause WMT to inverse the market growth.

# 5. Is there a better alternative?

Maybe Costco? but Walmart fundamentals are better with higher performing chart data. (I own Costco as well).

TLDR: WMT has solid fundamentals, is down 10% for no reason, is seriously undervalued right now, there's no bear case, no rising competition, potential huge growth with online presence, it's a BUY.

md20ir,gs6sk7c,stocks,comment,1616690173,"The bear case on Walmart is really two things, first and foremost it’s seen relatively weak revenue growth as a percent of revenue and secondly that Walmart+ hasnt really been making strong inroads against Amazon. As a result it has underperformed the market over this bull run.

It’s best hope of really growing revenue is China and east Asia. Now the thing here is that the business model really lives or dies on its supply chain, profitability really comes from a large number of stores feeding off the same supply chain infrastructure. The cost of running the supply chain scales nicely with more stores. In this regard it’s doing better than Costco in east Asia but the total number of stores is still low and they aren’t expanding rapidly. This might pay off long term but it’s not in the bag.

Long story short, it’s obviously a solid company but it faces serious challenges in reaching new heights.","['AMZN', 'WMT']"

Walmart could grow year upon year, but a P/E that high doesn't need regular growth, they need break-out growth. Keep in mind retailer's margins aren't tech company margins, even most of Amazon's profit comes from AWS.   

Is Walmart a good buy? I have absolutely no idea, but you're definitely betting on something big at the current price and there absolutely could be a correction (in particular as they're priced like growth rather than value).","['AMZN', 'WMT']"

I don’t really think it’s going to grow that much. Way to many competitors. I’d be careful with investing a lot into them.

Plus they are going to be needing to spend a lot of money because of nonsense laws California just passed requiring all trucks to be diesel alternatives by 2035 which isn’t going to be cheap for them.

I operated CNG tractors for awhile and they were very expensive to maintain as well as they broke down a lot, not to mention it’s difficult to buy CNG for them in the state of Florida so doing a Miami - Lakeland run you’d run out of CNG and be stuck on the side of the road. You’d think you can buy CNG for semi trucks in Miami but there’s actually only a few CNG stations that trucks can use across the entire state, none of which run along highway 27 between Orlando and Miami.

California is a lot more remote than Florida and if you’re having to make a run between Los Angeles and Reno it’s not going to work out very well. Yet Schneider and other companies are going to be forced by Californians nonsense laws to figure it out.

Sure they might not use CNG and might go for electric but have you seen how tiny electric parking lots are? There’s no way you’re turning 70’ tractor around in one of those and charging it. They will have to convince the owners of Flying J / Pilot, Loves and TA’s to replace the diesel stations with electric stations. That’s going to be expensive infrastructure for them to do.

The company I work for moved back into diesel tractors after realizing alternatives costed more to operate due to break downs and not being able to buy CNG as easily as diesel.

The keystone pipeline that Joe Biden cancelled is also a brick to the trucking industry by causing diesel prices to skyrocket again.

Democrats have continuously shortened the hours of service laws such as Barrack Obama administration requiring drivers to take a 30 minute break during there on duty time every 8 hours. Meaning freight can’t move and drivers aren’t going to want to be hot / cold they’ll idle there trucks requiring use of diesel to run.

I personally believe this will all be over within a month - I strongly believe the bull market will return - but until then, I... don't know how to make money with swings.

md08ge,,stocks,post,1616684469,"Time to update my investing strategyBefore I begin, let me just say that for the most part, I've had my head in the sand regarding recent market movements.  This is not a reaction to any correct that might be currently happening, but rather to a sudden (but very welcome) change in my personal financial status.

Up until recently, I've been unemployed, but with a couple thousand USD put aside in a roth IRA and invested in a moderately concentrated spread of tech stocks, growth-focused ETFs, and some REITs.  I don't regret my past decisions, but since I've recently secured a well-paying job and I'm living with very low expenses, I'd like to start putting aside a few hundred dollars a month to grow my investments.

Since I'm going to be dealing with much larger quantities of money very soon, I'd like to lower my overall risk a bit and diversify my portfolio so that it's no longer 60% tech stocks.  Ideally, I'd like for some large portion of my wealth to be a very passive core set of investments, while a smaller part is set aside for more active management in case I find particular opportunities I believe in (with a share of these profits reinvested into the safer core instead of reinvesting them into risky trades).

Would it be wrong to just pick a low-expense ETF like VTI and use it for the vast majority of my investments?  It seems like an easy way to get diverse exposure to the stock market, but I might be better off adding in exposure to other asset classes as well.

md08ge,gs6iqjj,stocks,comment,1616686204,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

md1tvt,gs77041,stocks,comment,1616696069,"Here's the little I know about this. In IPO (initial public offering) the initial amount of stocks and initial price are decided. There is some negotiation. Big investors committed to participate the IPO have their say about the price. I don't think there is one optimal target price for single share. Those responsible just try to engineer the share price and amount offered so that the company gets the amount of capital it wants, the existing ownership is diluted acceptably but the IPO price will still remain attractive. Having said this, I don't think anybody wants to make the initial price $1 or less. No one willingly creates a penny stock - it is a result of stock price falling.

The stock price after IPO is a different thing. There are studies suggesting there is an optimal share price for market cap. I've heard examples between $5 - $8. Example: company trades at $20 when the stock is split in two. The new stock price settles somewhere higher than $10, causing the split to increase market cap. According to theory anyway.

md1fii,,stocks,post,1616687598,"Where to put money - for a long term investorSorry I don't have the answers to the question in the title...this is mostly thinking out loud & hoping to spur productive conversation.

Like many of you, I have been somewhat baffled to see my portfolio getting crushed, while the indices continue to trade near all time highs (obviously Nasdaq a bit lower than S&P500 and Dow).  Sure, my portfolio is tech-heavy, but I've got ~40% of my portfolio in non-tech.

So the question is: if these stocks are all getting smashed, where is all the money flowing to? I checked out the YTD returns of the S&P500 components, which can be found here: https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance

Just from skimming through that list, I noticed a few themes: oil stocks, bank stocks, a few industrial stocks sprinkled throughout, and some reopening stocks (i.e. retailers, airlines).

So that answered some questions for me.  My portfolio has no oil, bank, or industrial exposure.  I've previously been bearish on oil and banks and I don't feel like I innately know enough about industrials to invest intelligently in those stocks.  I'm thinking a lot of fellow amateur investors are at least somewhat in the same boat, so this market rotation seems to be driven by professional money managers into territory that the rest of us aren't super comfortable with. (Over simplification - I know. Just trying to piece together a story that makes sense at a high level).

So this obviously leads to the question - where do I put my money?  I'm lucky enough to have some excess cash, so I have the option to double down on my big tech names at these lower levels.  I've already averaged down multiple times, so the tech allocation in my portfolio continues to grow, so I hesitate to repeatedly throw money in as the techs keep getting pounded.

One of my fear with this is that 10 year bond rates are sitting around 1.6%.  I feel like we'll have a very slow, creeping climb to around 2.75% or so.  So are tech stocks going to continue to get beaten up every day we see a 0.1% increase in bond rates?  I don't think thats sustainable, so at some point when bond rates rise and growth stocks don't get pulled down, that could potentially be a sign of a bottom and that may be time to dump money into high quality growth stocks as they start to climb back up.

The other option is to join the crowd and invest in oil, banks, or industrials.  I feel like I've missed the run-up in oil stocks and that seems like it'll be a diminishing industry over the long haul (though not over short or mid term). So maybe throw some money at industrial or bank stocks to hopefully create some offset in tech-heavy portfolios?

What do you guys think?  If you're a long-term investor, where are you going to put your money at this point?","['NDAQ', 'DOW', 'SPGI']"

Most of the time it doesn’t matter so there’s only a small difference in price for different shares. Some classes also have different payout rights that can offset voting rights.

I’d imagine if someone was trying to gain a controlling stake you’d start to see a premium for higher voting rights, but it’s pretty irrelevant otherwise.

Edit: The case with the A share premium for Berkshire is totally different, FYI. They have greater claim to earnings and assets than the B, besides better voting rights. You’d have to look at the disclosures, but those shares are completely different as regards economic power. There is probably near zero voting premium on them. Why? Buffett has enough to control, so only his shares would have a voting control premium on them. If he were to arrange a sale of them all, all at once, you’d see that (they’d fetch a massive amount above where Berkshire is now).

You can see the same stuff when there is a takeover bid. The share price increasing is coming from someone paying up to get control all at once.",['BRK.B']

Yes I know there's no guarantee and there's always risk when playing the stock market, but what stock(s) would you recommend, that is the **safest and most likely** to have >10% gain a year from now?

I'm leaning towards going all-in AAPL again (yes I also know never to put everything in one basket but it's AAPL - *right*?) because I feel it's a solid company with excellent management and unbelievable customer loyalty and partly because I cannot afford to lose much of this 30K

mczf3l,gs6bg91,stocks,comment,1616683191,"the thing is no one knows the answer. In general, yes they say lower is better, but a lot factors play a role. For example:

\- If a company isn't doing so well (fundamentally speaking), then the valuation multiples will reflect that (a value trap). On the other hand, there might companies which have low multiples, and you determine that the market is wrong on that (value).

Then you have cyclical factors that play a role, for example when the economy is expected to perform better than current market conditions, an investor would be willing to pay more to buy the stock (multiples expansion). When the economy is expected to do worse than current market conditions, an investor investor would be willing to pay less (multiples contraction)

\- For a startup company that isn't profitable, the P/E multiple doesn't make sense (P/S or P/EBITDA might be more suitable), whereas for a mature company, P/E or P/B makes more sense.

\- Industries also tend to have homogeneous factors which impact multiples e.g. tech (high) vs utilities (low).

As you can see there's a lot of detail that can go into multiples, there's no hard number which can tell you whether Stock A is overvalued or undervalued. You have to consider a lot of factors to determine whether the multiple is too high or too low",

Bear Case: Niche retailer who took a large impairment charge in 2020 which took them to a sizable loss. Will face ever increasing competition from online mega giants, and they have a material debt overhang.

Bull case: Even the absolute worst retailers are trading at a 30%+ revenue multiple premium from JOAN’s current levels. Even at my absolute most bearish valuations, where they’d still be the cheapest retailer I can find in the market, there’s 8-10% easy upside. When you consider they’ve generally turned a profit, had been consistently growing revenue YOY, and it’s being reported will be offering a $.40 dividend this looks like it may be another CARR situation where there’s 100% upside just to normalize valuation.

I just decided to download the app on IOS and it blew my mind because it put everything in one place.

It lets you add a list of your favourite tickers so you can see them all on the same page in real time.

It also lists upcoming earnings reports for your favourite stocks.

And if you scroll down on any page it lists news articles related to the stocks on your list as well.

mcfim3,,stocks,post,1616617041,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 24, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.

Market participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. 

After a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. 

The rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

I'm 20 and from Eastern Europe which means a lot of US index funds aren't available to me. I'm looking to build a diversified but low risk portfolio, I'm not looking for day trading and I just want to buy and hold for 20+ yrs After doing my research, I came up with a plan of how to invest, and I think I'll follow the 80%-20% rule or 70-30% but I would really like your opinion on this and if you think my portfolio is balanced enough or too repetitive etc. Tell me what would you take out/keep and how much would you allocate because I keep hearing different things😫

1.VWCE FTSE All World - this is the one I'm gonna start with because now I have limited funds and slowly keep building my portfolio. But seems the safest to start investing in with the small amount I have.

2. AGGH iShares Bond core global aggregate UCITS (I still can't decide between both because my currency isn't € or $, but I think I'll go € as it's more used in EU)

3. WSML iShares MSCI World Small Cap 

4.DPYE iShares Developed Markers Property Yelid UCITS ETF.  Here idk if I should go DPYE or IDWP?
 Is it worth it more to reinvest it or keep it as distributing? Anyway it's a long time until I'll invest in this and I'll do it just because I want a more diversified portfolio and not to put everything in one basket in case something happens. Also I would like to get into real estate but still have to do more research to see if it's worth it.

What do you think about this plan long term?What would you take or what would you add? From my research, it seems solid. Now idk how much should I put into them. I was thinking 62% VWCE 20%AGGH  8% WSML 10% DPYE. 

But when just starting, until I get WSML and DPYE , I'll buy 70% VWCE and 30% AGGH. What's your opinion on this?",['MSCI']

mcwwb2,,stocks,post,1616674693,"NEED ADVICE ON A PORTFOLIO TRANSFER MESS UP!!!Hi Guys... In a bit of a pickle, can you please help?

I'm based in the UK and have had a Lloyds share dealing account for about ten years - their service is very basic, plus the support is very bad also, and so about 2 months ago I started a transfer over to a new broker called Interactive Investor. 

MY ISSUE

Here is where it gets interesting and where the problem lies... My US stocks immediately disappeared from my Lloyds account (meaning I couldn't trade them) yet did not appear in the new brokers account! This has been like this, with my shares effectively in limbo for over 2 months (coming up for 9 weeks at time of writing) and as you guys know, the market is dropping hard!

MY MAIN QUESTION

Should I have still had the ability to trade over this 9 week period? I appreciate that US shares may take a little longer to transfer over, but 9 weeks?? Surely this shouldn't be the case as I am now about 25k down because of being unable to trade?

MOVING FORWARD

I want to go after Lloyds for compensation for these losses, but need to know that normally you would still be able to trade whilst this all taking place (I appreciate there maybe a small bit of downtime, but surely not 9 weeks!)?

Any help here would be greatly appreciated from anyone with experience in this?

TLDR

Lloyds have left my shares in limbo, leaving me unable to trade for 9 weeks, market has dropped big time - I want compensation!",

If the rates go up too much the housing market crashes due to the amount a person can get a loan for goes down.  Company start defaulting on debt more since it’s harder to rollover their current debt.  Then it spills into the stock market since share prices will drop and you will have margin calls go out. 

Now you have to ask what does it mean when something defaults on a debt.  Well that active money destruction since that money is taken out of the system.  This process is called debt deflation and it’s what happens when a debt bubble bursts.

He maintains that long term inflation will not be an issue and that their target is 2% inflation. 

Personally, I think the fed has to make some changes to current policy as I do not think the current level of inflation is sustainable and will cause long term inflation to rise. I think we are printing way too much money and by end of 2021 we must begin raising rates. Intrest rates being raised as a preventive measure will do much less damage than interested rates being raised as a defensive measure if inflation is already to high.",

Summary:

\- Most of the article is about VW (maybe sponsored by VW? :-) )

\- VW become the #1 EV maker in EU last year

\----EV cars sales in EU: Dec 2019: TSLA: 110K , VW 46K;  Dec 2020: TSLA: 96K, VW: 174K

\- VW CEO (Diess) using the same strategy as Musk (creating media hype, ""power day"" similar to ""battery day, etc), stock has gone up 80% ytd, meme stock potential

\- This year, VW plans to deliver 1 million plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and Diess aims to surpass Tesla in EV sales no later than 2025. Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.

\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).

\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.

\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years

\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)

\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models

\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)

\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from ""legacy"" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves

\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think ""only EV after year xxxx"" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider

&#x200B;

Opinion:

\- would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is one of the main thing that TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with

\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)

&#x200B;

What do you think?

I thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour.

PS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.

EDIT 1: Just for the heck of it, I just bought a couple of TSLA at 655.

EDIT 2: added 2 more TSLA at 638.

mcl00u,,stocks,post,1616631498,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) Has anyone actually seen the financials of this company? FIRST DD

Drug Manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, this place is made of money  (45 billion) and spends it too (37 billion). 100$ per share is pretty low considering it is a young company (Founded 2013). I see them all the time on commercials for Humira and they have dozens of other drugs available and many more under research and development.(source seeking alpha)


ABBV focuses on immunocology, oncology, neuroscience, eyecare, virology, women's health, and  anesthetics. They are investigating drugs for diabetic nephropathy, cystic fibrosis and many other areas.

CORONA VIRUS

ABBVIE has partnered with global authorities to help determine the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, while managing supply chain resources around the world. They have took a hit financially because of covid 19 and ""operations remain uncertain"" (SEC filings FORM 10-K, Item 1, Buisness).

I think this is a undervalued company that could literally be one the biggest pharmaceutical company in America. A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AT ALL TIMES

But, most of there revenues (60ish%?) come from humira and many competitors are developing and about to sell their own version of humira which is going to rape ABBVIE financially. Thats why they are prioritizing their cash now to undergo millions of dollars worth of construction and revamp research, development, and production to create the next big thing.

ALLERGEN

They recently purchased 60% of Allergen... further investigation required by yourself. too lazy, last minute edits.

PLUS LOOK WHO OWNS THE STOCK

Biggest institutional holders: vanguard, blackrock, JP Morgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway, etc.

Biggest Mutual Fund Holders: 
Vanguard total and 500
SPDR S+P500
Fidelity500 Index Fund
I shares Core S+P 500 ETF
Etc.


I'm done writing basic DD, this took way too long and I'm just a dumb GME ape who just got into stock but love em like my kittens. But lastly, I think this is a longer hold and there may be a better time to buy, like after competitors start selling versions of HUMIRA and the stock hits harder, idk any of these time-frames this is prior research but valid nonetheless. OK BYE tell me what you think.

tl;dr this company made 45 billion last year, keeps increasing revenues and spending BILLIONS on upgrades to r&d. longer hold but very young company (2013) already making billions and many big name institutional, and mutual fund holders invested heavily recently also works globally to determine efficiency of COVID-19 treatments while managing supply chains, NBD.

How does the price go up and down?Say I buy 1 Apple stock on Charles Schwab for the market price of $200. Did that come from someone else selling the stock for $200 (that’s what I figure) or did I buy it from Schwab? If it’s between people, than that means for every buy there is a sell, in which case it seems the supply and demand would always be an equilibrium. I figure supply and demand is ultimately the reason for how the price moves, but how exactly does that work? More people offer to sell the stock so the price goes down even before they the sale goes through? How is it that there’s always buyers and sellers available? Is there ever a time where basically nobody wants to sell apple so buyers can’t buy, or nobody wants to buy apple so sellers can’t sell? If it’s through the brokerage, how is it getting all those stocks?

If the market price is exactly 200 and I buy 1 share how much would the new market price move up or down? Perhaps we have to know how many shares their are in total? What is that called when I look it up?

mcl06w,gs48h7m,stocks,comment,1616633257,They are traded between buyers and sellers whether that been individuals or institutions.  Most trades are done through limit orders not market orders and those limits set the price.  If you say you are willing to buy something with a limit of $200 and someone else is wiling to sell it for $200 or less it will trade at $200.  However if no one is willing to sell it for less that $201 then no trades happen until someone gives in and agrees to buy it for $201 and then $201 becomes the new price.  The same thing happens on the way down where someone is willing to sell it lower than the current price because no one else is willing to buy it at the current price.  If you place a market order you are saying you want to buy/sell no matter what the price is so it will trade at the closest bid/ask which is just someone else's limit order.  Supply and demand set the price because of more people want to buy than sell the buyers will give in and pay higher prices.,

mcl06w,gs4p2bp,stocks,comment,1616641877,"There's many parties/players involved in the stock market; and some entities play multiple roles (for example, a brokerage may also be a market maker and hedge fund). I'm aware of the following below:

1) retail investors - people like you who use brokerages to perform trades. Retail investor trading only make up between about 15% to 30% of the market transactions (ref: [https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-01-29/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-01-29/factbox-the-us-retail-trading-frenzy-in-numbers) ).

2) dark pools - performs algorithmic trading on large transactions (and additionally hides ""bids"" and ""asks""). This is a service that is provided for wealthy clients (e.g., hedge funds).

3) market makers - use algorithmic trading to create liquidity in the stock market. They make money on the spread between the bid and ask. They engage in the practice of payment-for-order-flow, because it helps them determine the ""bid"" and ""ask"" price. Note, they may hold excess shares.

4) institutions - hedge funds, mutual funds, banks, etc.",
mcl06w,gs46ufl,stocks,comment,1616632466,"Long story short there are different types of orders when you buy a stock. For example if you buy at market there’s some wiggle room in the price and is executed at the quickest time of delivery, but your price isn’t entirely locked in. Limit orders you set your price floor or ceiling and are put into a transaction queue until the underlying value gets to that point. Generally brokers will protect you to match your order with the closest available one. 

So let’s say you try to buy a single share of AAPL at $200, you’ll likely just get on the first available purchase order that meets sufficient volume to execute. You won’t pay $200, but I wouldn’t make it a practice of it. This could become a VERY dangerous practice if you were to buy in large volumes on a smaller less active share. The ticker reflects the last transaction price. If demand is low and price comes down to meet supply it’s red and vice versa. If the price were precisely $200 and you bought for $200 nothing would change. Changes reflect a differential in what’s being paid and what’s asked.

**TLDR** At a very fundamental level a stock’s price is really only driven by supply and demand.

There’s a lot of interesting theory behind it depending on your interest in mathematics and statistics. A lot of the terms thrown out so often now, <insert squeeze or sell off here> are just edge cases of extreme activity of limit demands and supply. This is why I’ve found GameStop interesting as an example. Theoretically there’s a limit to any share value relative to the underlying equity, growth, implied risk, sentiment, and any other factor. Then if you abstract it a bit to a buyer and seller level this changes at an entirely different level since many people are deterred by a stock like Berkshire or Amazon with high cost. 

As an example of a completely recalled estimate I made a few weeks ago so numbers won’t be perfect. At $350 a share and around 70m in outstanding shares with ~$6.5bn in revenue GME’s market cap to revenue ratio was 3.79. As a contrast, Amazon is around $3.1k with around 440 million shares floating (which don’t rotate as often) and $386.1bn in revenue so a ratio of around 3.526. Effectively GME was more valued than Amazon without any of the intrinsics. When people boast pipe dreams and expectations of $1000+ this is why I found it interesting that people valued a company well beyond that ratio. There are definitely other factors, but at it’s core I find that to be an indicator of a price limit. Nobody looking solely at business expectations and growth prospects would value the two companies equally.","['BRK.B', 'AMZN', 'AAPL']"

mczdt4,,stocks,post,1616682141,"Fidelity or Vanguard? (Read below)So, I've got a complicated situation going on with my address. I would be able to open a Vanguard account right now (I have the application filled out and waiting), but Fidelity will not verify my identity and want me to mail something; I did mail it, and they said they need MORE address information.

I have about $50 to get started, $100 if I stretch, and realistically I'm more than happy to throw money in and let it grow. Ideally I'd love to get something in Tesla or Microsoft that should grow fairly consistently for a long while.

But, as I understand, Vanguard doesn't have fractional shares, while Fidelity does. So there's my dilemma.

Should I get vanguard, and find some small stocks to grow my money until I can sell them and buy bigger stocks? Or should I try and call fidelity and suffer through that? I'm just not sure if it would be worth it, since I don't really intend to be a super active trader.

Microsoft has a monopoly over the business world and has a subscription-based business model with products that are timeless (Word, Excel, PowerPoint). Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations have been used for centuries if not millenniums and we will continue to use these methods of communication for centuries more. PLUS the shift to cloud is driving demand for their cloud offering Azure (50% growth in one year). It's intelligent cloud segment revenues grew 23%+ a year and quickly gaining market share. Ever since they pivoted to SaaS, their revenue and earnings have been stable and increasing so consistently - it's beautiful. Businesses will always choose Microsoft!

Apple relies more heavily on consumer products and its total revenue and earnings haven't grown that much since 2015. What’s next after the iPhone? Car? Glasses? We're betting on them innovating in a massive way. But can they replicate the vision and innovation of Steve Jobs? Many men and women have tried... Only person doing it right now is Elon Musk. But that's besides the point.

Check this out - financials support Microsoft as a better growth company than Apple.

2015 to 2020 Revenue (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - $93.6B to $153B (+64.5% - $59.4B growth) $AAPL - $233.7 to $294B (+25.8% - $60.3B growth)

2015 to 2020 EBITDA (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - $33.6B to $71.7B (+113% - $38.1B growth) $AAPL - $77.9B to $85.1B (+9.2% - $10.5B growth)

2015 to 2020 Operating Profit Margin (June 2015 to Present): 
$MSFT - 19.4% to 33.4% (+72%)
$AAPL - 30.2% to 21.7% (-28%)

Microsoft is a cash cow and sales and profits are increasing at double digit rates. Apple is even more of a cash cow but sales and profits are slowing. Microsoft has a new core offering (Azure).

NFTs-
A collection of digital art from an unknown artist sold for 69 million via NFT. If you don't know this new emerging market i encourage you to check it out. 

From Benzinga
-----------
NFTs Coming: Playboy was attracted to the NFT space given its huge collection of content and the economics of being able to monetize on the initial and each subsequent sale. Kohn told viewers that Playboy has a 68-year-old archive of content that could be valuable in the NFT space.

“That’s a perfect example of a new revenue stream that has emerged and really leveraged this phenomenal IP we have,” Kohn said.
-----------

From the earnings call yesterday from Chief Brand Officer, Rachel Webber-
""Lastly, we are sitting on almost 70 years of the most incredible and iconic art and photography. We are actively working on our non-fungible tokens or NFT, and digital collectible strategy to enter the space in a thoughtful way, designed for long-term growth and community adoption. We are thrilled by the runway ahead and the wealth of opportunities afforded us by our priceless intellectual property.""

Kohn on fox news stated today that there will be an announcement soon regarding NFTs and it's not just their 68 year old archive that will be utilized. He started throwing out some of the most influential artists of our time that have collaborated with Playboy and are available for NFTs. This is the hottest sector on the market right now and the only sector that is completely ignoring the volitility of the overall market currently. 

Even if you're not into emerging markets, their financials are beautiful. Their earnings call yesterday posted 89% growth in revenues year over year. They generated over 1 billion this year in sales on digital commerce platforms in China alone.

Their magazine is dead, but their brand isn't and I'm bullish on how they are transforming their company.

I was wondering if a person could be successful in purchasing a call for a stock that's gained the most since closing time, since the Call Option's price may not have adjusted from the previous day's close to the next day at 9:30 AM ET, since the option markets are not active. 

Here's an example of what I mean: [Intel's price appreciated by 6.6% after 4:00 PM ET on Tuesday, March 23rd.](https://imgur.com/a/2qVoKUu) The option prices are still, from my understanding, going to be based on March 23rd's price fluctuation, which was minimal, and therefore, the option prices should be relatively low. However, I use this 6.6% price gain to my advantage: I quickly put a BID for a Call Option for Strike Price = $65.  In the morning of Wednesday, March 24th at 9:30 AM, if my BID was within the range of the Bid-Ask spread, there's a great chance that my order would execute, and I'm the owner of a relatively cheap Call Option for a stock who's price increased by 6.6% but who's underlying option doesn't reflect this increase. 

A few minutes later, the call options increase dramatically.

mck8mm,gs41o0l,stocks,comment,1616629942,"Gamble by buying calls near close after a series of shitty days. Usually limit sell orders are cancelled by the broker at the end of the day. If there were any looming low limit buys, you can bet the firms who can see the order stack and are directly tethered will get pick of the litter. Market orders are adjusted to reflect the change in prices based on the Greeks. It’s very unlikely you’ll get that order through on open. If you get something at morning surge prices after a big after hours I’d be on the watch to be ready to dump at first sign of profit. Unless it’s a deep position bought cheap that’s secured a large enough margin I tend to dump at anything over 20%. The only thing worse than selling early at a solid profit is missing the window entirely and losing.

Usually it’s a high IV period, so you really don’t want to be buying options during those times if it can be avoided. A lot can be said for betting on the next day’s open after a prolonged period of contraction. There’s risk and if you play this strategy don’t go over 5% of your available account balance.",

mclfm7,,stocks,post,1616632753,"Bullish DD on Canadian Pacific Raliway ($CP) - some bearish points too First DD, so I'll try to do my best! I only have a small position in this, 1 share, since it's expensive ($356) but wanted to share it.

&#x200B;

Bullish points:

* Entered a merger agreement with Kansas City Southern (another railway) to purchase them for US$29 billion. This will be the first direct railway that connects the US, Canada, and Mexico. Canadian Pacific Railway stock dipped from $385.87 to around $353 on this news they were purchasing the Kansas City Southern railway. I think this is a good buy-in opportunity as I think it'll recover slowly in the next few weeks or so.
* In the last 1 year, it has gone from $206.82 to $356.10 and in the last 6 months, it has gone from $300.39 to $356.10 (it was $385.87 at its all time high before dipping on the KCS railway purchase). Doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be the same in the future but generally, it has been a bullish stock during the COVID-19 pandemic and will probably continue to grow as the pandemic is over
* According to wsj ([https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CP/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CP/research-ratings)  
), it has bullish price targets. High price target is $591, median price target is $495, and low price target is $460 **(currently $356).**
* Quarterly net income gained 20.7% in Q4 2020 compared to the same period Q4 2019, and also set an all-time record
* Their board recently approved a five-for-one split of their shares on Jan. 27, 2021. They will seek shareholder approval at its annual meeting on April 21st and I imagine that they'll probably win with the majority of shareholders approving. While stock splits don't change the fundamental price/values of a company, it definitely makes it more accessible for people to purchase the stock (if they don't have fractional shares on their platform) and even if they had an option to get fractional shares, the psychological effect of seeing a stock at a lower price will be more encouraging to some.
* This is just a personal prediction of mine but imo, I do think that trade will start to increase as COVID-19 starts to go away and that there'll be less trade disputes over what Canada's importing/exporting to the US.

&#x200B;

Bearish Points:

* The Kansas City Southern merger deal is great for $CP in the long run but what if the Canadian or American governments decide to cancel the merger due to some antitrust laws or something? I don't think it'll happen because there are other major railways in the US/Canada and this merger doesn't make Canadian Pacific Railway a monopoly/even close to a monopoly in terms of railways.
* Yearly income was the same in 2019 and 2020 - around $2.44 billion Canadian dollars (though you could argue that during COVID-19, they faced some challenges initially at the start of the pandemic). Someone has commented that CP was never given approval in their last couple of times to merge with a US railway so I have to do more research on that and you should take this into consideration. 
* Current unstable market conditions and general bearish sentiment (I'm a bull though) currently could decrease the price of the stock. However, it's honestly been holding up pretty nicely in the month of March, where a lot of stocks have decreased or hasn't moved that much up. Except, until they bought the Kansas City Southern railway, where they dropped about $27 from their all time high. Other than that, was going up/stable up to that point during this month.

They got the approval in late February. The stock jumped from 180SEK to 215SEK and then proceeded to crash nearly 34% down to \~143 SEK, where it is now.

What surprises me is that only good news has come from the company ever since it hit it's all time high at 215 SEK. They're delivering this drug to patients, they're hiring and rapidly, and this quarter they're going to start generating revenue.

The first few days after the announcement I saw the OMX Stockholm 30 was down and I thought that the general market being down is what was causing the stock to slide. Then the OMX Stockholm 30 started going up, and the price of the stock continued to decline.

I looked at analyst price targets and according to Yahoo finance and the average price target is 217SEK, which is above it's all time high.

The only rational conclusion I can come up with for why the price is trading so low is possibly high short interest. But I can't find any short interest data on the stock. Yahoo finance has N/A for anything related to short interest.

Only 25 out of the 50 states have legalized sports betting with several set to legalize this year. For all the apes out there who are heavy in weedstonks. 27 out of 50 States have decriminalized and 16 states have legalized weed to put this into perspective. 

DraftKings is current trading at under 70, and has a price target of 87. They had a 25%-30% annual growth in 2020 despite most sports being shut down and or limited in a large capacity. With major sports returning to a sense of normality in the coming months I believe the 87 price target is relatively low. Adding in all of their partnerships they’ve made in the past few months, some being exclusive and some not. Their target total revenue for 2021 is 1 Billion Dollars. 

In 2021 so far, Michigan launched online sports betting. As well as Virginia. Partnership with the NFL expanded to Canada. The all knowing Cathie Wood purchased half a million shares. Dish Network announced a strategic agreement where the Sportsbook could potentially be accessible for the degenerate dad sitting on the couch who doesn’t know how to work his phone and operate the app.

Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

I have typically made wise investment decisions since getting into the game March of last year (great time to hop in that's for sure). Although I jumped into the NIO train with insufficient research back in mid-February and have averaged -27% as of today.

I know the golden rule is to ""buy low, sell high""....but is NIO just a dying fish that I should dump at this point or do you guys actually think it is worth holding onto other than for the sake of ""holding to the moon""?

mcku23,gs45kxr,stocks,comment,1616631851,"When you look at a stock quote there are actually three prices.  The bid, ask and last.  The last is considered the price so in your case $10.  This is the last price anyone bought/sold the stock but for you to buy it for $10 someone else would have to be willing to sell it for $10.  That may not be the case (this is what causes stocks to go up).  The ask is the lowest price anyone is currently willing to sell it at.  If you put in a market order you will by it at the ask price no matter if that is $1,000.  Obviously that is not likely on a $10 stock but could happen.  If you place a limit order then you will buy it at the current ask as long as your limit is higher than the current ask and if it is not then you will be a bid at the new price.

Example:

Bid 9:55 Last 10.00 Ask 10.10

If you placed a market order or a limit above 10.10 you would buy it for that.  If you placed a limit order for 10.03 you would not buy it but the current bid would now be you and change to 10.03.  The same thing is true for selling.  If you want to sell you would have to place a limit below the current bid so if someone placed a sell with the limit below your ask of 10.03 you would then buy it at 10.03.  In most cases either the bid or ask will usually be at the last and the spread (difference between them) is usually only a penny or two but for low volume stocks the spread can be much larger as in my example.",

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['NDAQ', 'TSLA', 'TWTR', 'AAPL']"

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

>The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above. 

>An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

I’m quite torn; 

1. S&P 500
- I love listening to Jack Bogle and Buffet talk about purely investing in the US as it makes sense to back a country which such great innovation and stable economy etc. 
- Historically the S&P 500 has destroyed the MSCI world index 
- I’m in Australia and the management fee for s&p500 is 0.04% vs 0.19% for an all world index. 

2. All World Index 
- offers diversification, in the case the US doesn’t prevail in the future 
- doesn’t take any bets on countries or sectors, just purely let’s successful countries run through as winners. 
- perhaps a greater sleep at night factor? 

Let me know your thoughts
- I know this all depends on risk tolerance etc. so for clarity I’m 18M, who’s very tolerant to risk. Currently hold a largely tech weighted portfolio and looking to expand to a more diverse etf.","['MSCI', 'SPGI']"

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['AMZN', 'INTC', 'MSFT', 'QCOM']"

mcqwym,,investing,post,1616650283,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Yahoo finance: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-record-q-1-results-201804235.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-record-q-1-results-201804235.html)

Company announcement: [https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021](https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021)

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

mc095v,,investing,post,1616572099,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably.

[March 4]    
>Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
>....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

My question is: what's the valuation and potential upside of LGL shares in this?",
mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['NFLX', 'AMZN', 'GS', 'FB', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'CRM', 'MSFT', 'IP', 'NI']"

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

In the *trial*, QR-421a demonstrated benefit on multiple measures of vision that moved in concordance, including visual acuity, visual fields, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging, after a single dose. QR-421a was observed to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Based on these findings, the Company plans to advance QR-421a to two parallel pivotal *Phase* 2/3 *trial*s by year end 2021 – one in early-moderate patients, one in advanced patients.

""We're pleased to have met all the objectives we set for the *Stellar* *trial*, including determining suitable registration endpoints, the dose, dosing interval, and patient population for the *Phase* 2/3 pivotal *trial*s,"" said Aniz Girach, MD, Chief Medical Officer of ProQR, ""With just a single dose, QR-421a demonstrated *clinical* proof of concept with benefit observed in treated eyes compared to the untreated eyes in multiple concordant measures of vision.

Based on preliminary Regulatory guidance, we plan to submit protocols to advance QR-421a to pivotal testing. This is our second program targeting a severe inherited retinal disease that is moving into pivotal *trial*s, which we believe further validates our RNA therapy platform and our capabilities to design and efficiently take these programs through *clinical* *develop*ment.""

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",

mbvs0e,gs1o9xi,investing,comment,1616592794,"~~Can you give the table number? Table 7 on pg 379 of the full prospectus is maybe what you’re looking at?~~

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']

Surely this amplifies the return of the underlying and you don't need to worry about rebalancing yourself.

Now say instead of an individual investor, you pool together other investors and buy non-leveraged ETFs.

mc8nea,,investing,post,1616599768,"Fluent (FLNT) - Highly volatile + Market Psychology play 

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

\- It has been recently (17.03.2021) **downgraded from 'Outperform' to 'Market Perform'** by Barrington Research, due to the slowdown in the growth for the fourth-quarter. The management claims that their decision ""... to limit its business to higher-quality advertising traffic..."" **may result in being beneficial in the long term** ([Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/why-fluent-stock-was-slammed-on-wednesday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)). Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

**Information worth noting;**

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['ADI', 'JPM']"

They also own a variety of other ventures including Wanlimu a   luxury consumer brand as well as 30% of Secoo with which they have a strategic partnership. Recently Qudian has invested in an early learning   education company (TAM $700B), as well as nearing completion on its   business park which will be completed this year.

Much like some other stocks was last year Qudian has been beaten to a pulp by the market. As of today (13/03/21) the company has a market cap of \~$490M. It’s shareholder equity? $1.655B. Yes, that’s not a typo this company has a price to asset ratio of 0.33. But now I hear you ask but what   about its earnings? In the three months to September 30 it made 87 million. Yuan? No, DOLLARS. Oh, and did I mention it has $219 million in cash?

The company has been through some tough times the last couple of years, with its regulatory   environment unstable and its earnings shrinking, that and its asset   quality decreased due to the rapid rise in delinquency rates during   COVID. I believe the company is turning the corner on this front,   however when you buy the stock you are not just buying a credit business, the CFO and CEO have stated they want to acquire companies   much in the same vein as Warren Buffet did with Berkshire Hathaway.

However   recently the CCP has stated that the next growth engine for China will not be an increase in factory capacity it will be from domestic consumption. What drives growth in an economy switching from production to consumption? Credit pure and simple. Qudian has outlasted a lot of   it’s competitors by tightening it’s lending policy, whilst this   conservative strategy has impacted it’s short term earnings it is now in   a place it in a position to capitalise on the new direction the government is taking on the economy.

Their current fair value is $415 and the sit at $350 they pay some of the highest dividends on the market as well at 3%. Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). 

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers. They will make most of the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I'd take this over a savings accnt anyday.

mb7dzn,grwejpc,investing,comment,1616478641,"LMT is about 10% of my portfolio and I have high hope for it, but there's really no guaranteed easy money. I initially bought at 370 and keep buying more and more on its way down to 320s, so now I just broke even.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop. Overall, I bought it because i think it'd be a great loooong term hold (i'm thinking 5-10 yrs), so I'm ok with the volatility. But there's really no such thing as guaranteed easy money.",['LMT']

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['NDAQ', 'HD']"

Canadian Pacific is buying Kansas City Southern in a ~$25B deal - ~22% premium to Friday's closeKansas City Southern ($KSU) was the last class 1 railroad after the big 6 (BNSF, Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific, and Canadian National) that had not yet been acquired or taken private. There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)  
Here is the [powerpoint presentation](https://ssl.lvl3.on24.com/event/30/20/89/4/rt/1/documents/resourceList1616341384560/cpkcsannouncementdeck32110amfinal1616341383050.pdf) being shown in this conference call

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['NSC', 'UNP', 'KSU', 'CSX']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

I wouldn't be surprised if you threw some money at them and the first couple little ones payed off, just to make you comfortable putting in bigger chunk of money. That one would disappear and you'd have no recourse. Realistically, it's all fairly small dollar - you couldn't possibly retain a lawyer and track these folks down for less than you'd be investing. Not that it would get you your money back if you did track them down.

No transparency, no updates, no reliable recommendations. No.

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BNGO/earnings/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BNGO/earnings/)

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

I know this is a long post and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I don't really have a specific question, I would just like to hear any feedback (besides, your an idiot, and don't ever buy stocks again), advice, even similar stories.",

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

ma29dn,grsamuq,investing,comment,1616394655,"Perhaps my story can be instructive. I am 55 years old. I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Would love to hear your feedback on the above.",

That'll happen when you compare a global fund vs a US only fund and focus only on the US part of the US/ex-US cycle. I can almost certainly point to times where VTI would have been worse than IWDA.

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

Furthermore, taking a quick glance at their financial statements, marketing is by far the largest expense item on their P&L. A potential green flag is their marketing expenses are much lower for the T9Ms in FY20 vs FY19. But, has Management indicated they are going to cut back on that spending and think they are starting to get some stickiness in their user base? They managed to grow revenues soundly, despite spending less on marketing, which is why I'm curious what has changed in just 1 year, given these expenses increased over 50% from FY18 to FY19, while rev only grew 30%.","['FB', 'EBAY']"

Most Poshmark sellers sell their product through other marketplaces as well (ebay, mercari, grailed), that offer less fees for both seller and buyer.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to. We are reaching the point of saturation, and so in this situation the biggest or the best are going to be what survives. This one doesn't have enough of a moat or a big enough size to make me think it will be one of them right now. Its definition of ""active"" users also seems a bit suspect to me (someone buying one item over the previous 12 months does not an ""active"" user make in my opinion... if they were giving information on repeat customers and sellers that would probably be more useful).",
m9adbw,,investing,post,1616257440,"Understanding China's economy & the embedded risks: This video has a surprisingly balanced and good take describing a lot of the risks and drivers of the Chinese economy.Watch the video here please [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg)

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

* Brazil
* India

The only one that is moving forward economically with much strength is China.  Those other three have fallen out of favor for a variety of means.  About 5 years ago, we we were seeing an exchange rate of 5.6 RMB to one USD.  Recently it's transposed digits to 6.5 RMB.  The same can be said of the Russian Ruble going from 56 to one USD, and now 74 to one USD.  

When your investments are analyzed and brought back, understand the FOREX component which can inflate (or deflate) your gains.  

The WSJ used to have an ""arbitrage"" portion in their paper to describe the cost of common goods like a cup of coffee or a BMW X5 (which was massive exported from the US market to the Chinese market for gain due to demand and currency price differences)  to let people know how much they're getting here, and abroad.",
m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",
m9adbw,grrytsx,investing,comment,1616385176,"Chinese politics aren't as one sided as folks might think.

- PBOC and other finance folks are the smart ones in the room.

- Military is filled with war mongers who don't understand economics. 

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0. US will fall back to Latin America for cheap labor, etc. 

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity. The island itself is worthless. You take Taiwan by force and you gain nothing but a small piece of land. Taiwanese will leave en masse.",

I didn't know about Ordos City the video talks about, so I googled it, turns out it's a city located in Inner Mongolia, which I know from my textbook back to high school, the extreme dry, windy weather and high latitude Plateau(ah, words might be redundant, but you got what I mean). I understand that the video might be true(as I said I didn't know the city, and I believe many Chinese don't know it either, and this is the point!), but it's biased to generalize the whole country, then talk about the economics of the whole giant China(financially, it's a complex, multi-dimensional system after all), this doesn't make sense to me, anyway, this is not the first time political motivated... But, seriously, people living in this side of the world(mainly America and Europe) should at least understand how big geographically china is, and why the northern west part of China is less developed.  Mostly, minorities live there with their own languages, majority people from southern/northern east part of China where full of mountains and rivers won't choose the live there, while all the youtubers like to take this special rare sample as prove base to show the world what China is like and will be, tbh, seeing modern houses/apartments building there is actually encouraging.

Like I said, I didn't know this city, but I do know a famous singer who is from Inner Mongolia, like many others coming to southern/Northern East of China for their career, seeking opportunities, making their stories known to everyday Chinese people like me. So we know how hard it is living there, and the government is promoting/making policies that keep encouraging us fresh graduates/investors to go there help the local economics by bringing the tourism, donation, building house, utilizing the wind resources for electricity generation and teaching/educating homeless kids/orphans there etc..  Of course their lives are getting better, and still because they are minorities, the weather is just not suitable for living  in long term, not many people would like to move to live there.

With that knowledge in mind, let's come back to the video and reviews, it just makes no sense to make any conclusions/judgments about the whole Chinese economics based on those rare less developing cities while they are improving, but people buying whatever those youtubers feed to their reviewers. I'm making this comment to pint it out, as I saw so many posts and videos use this same strategy to get the attention especially on YouTube, generating revenues for themselves, while brainwashing people who don't know about China, just keep it in mind, be open and the so called democracy is defined differently in different minds of people, although we all use the same word ""democracy""!

Please don't attack me or call me CCP bot whatever, it will hurts me, makes me sad, because I'm a legit human, I have feelings, I'm just here to provide you more information. All those hates and conspiracies are from misunderstanding, and I don't like to argue with people, always choose to be positive.",

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

m8o362,,investing,post,1616179606,"On Colombian Cannabis ( Clever Leaves $CLVR )  

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

m8o362,grjfujb,investing,comment,1616198653,"I live in Colombia and there are some key points worth knowing before entering this move:

1. **The regulation is volatile.** The government party does not support completely medicinal cannabis. President only supported it with the condition on being more strict on licenses (benefiting big producers as Clever) because his hated predecesor had a more progressive agenda on cannabis. Two years ago there were rumors about an official request looking for a reduction in our global quota. Never happened.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['PGR', 'UPS']"
m907q1,,investing,post,1616217239,"Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future ChangesThe Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

No debt

Make about 40K to 50K a year

Have an emergency saving account 5000$/10K.

Have 15K cash in a ""high""/lol saving account, this is my future 20% house down-payment account as I add more cash to it.

Contribute 6000$ every year in the beginning of the year to max Roth IRA in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund

Used to do 6% every check in 401k to get work match, but now upped to 15% as that was too little. Maxing it to 18K is too much for me though. Its trough Merrill Lynch in my work 401k in a Retirement fund, should I change to another 401k company? Or do I leave it as another forget it until retirement account?

Get 140$ taken out of every check to buy Walmart stock, this is bi-weekly. I get free money out of this that's why I do it, not versed in the single stock market, so its for the free money and Walmart is a pretty safe stock for the most part.

About 70K in Index funds by Vanguard. 24K in VTSAX, 12K in VTIAX, 4K in VBTLX. I use 15% out every check to in invest 60% in VTSAX, 30% in VTIAX and 10% in VBTLX.

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers.

Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

For those who are interested in ethical investing Brewdog is a certified [B-Corp](https://www.brewdog.com/bcorp) and has a growing focus on sustainable production and distribution. As part of their sustainability commitment, [all their recipes are publically available.](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/community/diy-dog)

As of writing, Brewdog does not have an IPO date, although have expressed a desire to go public in the past.

m8ugyr,grmpuy8,investing,comment,1616274792,"I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

* Relatively low downside risk: moderate P/E, decent dividend, no debt, likely very inflation resilient, great moat and overall business model

* Possible growth: video games, movies/series, and other media; still some untouched markets around the world (most of Asia), general trend of ""nerdy"" stuff becoming more mainstream

Disclaimer: Games Workshop has been my biggest holding for almost 2 years now, since i started investing.",['IP']
m8ugyr,grlkrn9,investing,comment,1616255601,"Interesting, love the outside the box picks.

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

It also appears they may not be able to meet upcoming long term debt covenants. It requires Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of below 5.5x by June. To me, they’re not going to meet this.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway. 

I don’t think theatres will be able to operate back at normal capacity for years with the move to streaming platforms and lack of big blockbuster productions during the pandemic year. It’ll be a steep uphill climb ... or a drop off the cliff.",

m8p7lq,,investing,post,1616182746,"ESG investing removed from retirement accounts?I was researching ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) or SRI (Socially Responsible Investing) strategies today, something I've been meaning to do for a while but that I am new to, when I came across an article that stated the following:

&#x200B;

""The U.S. Department of Labor released a new regulation in late October 2020 that may limit or eliminate socially responsible investing in retirement plans. While the rule was revised to remove explicit references to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, it mandates that fiduciaries of retirement plans choose investment strategies based entirely on how those strategies affect financial performance. This ruling may have a significant impact on funds and investments classified under ESG and socially responsible investing.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Were participants in these retirement plans not given the option to opt out of ESG investing? or are they now not being given the option to opt in?

Or has this regulation since been removed? Will it be?",

I think that they had a legitimate point that the claims made by some of the funds are not clear and/or hard to validate. However, they missed the point that a lot of people would like the option available to them, particularly in defined contribution plans. There are also literally hundreds of studies now that show ESG integration does not correlate with negative returns. Some ESG/SRI funds do worse than non-SRI/ESG funds, but that is true when comparing any group of funds. There is no evidence that the strategy as a whole is a risk and quite a bit to argue that it can lead to outperformance. 

There was a lot of industry pushback on the rule and it does seem illogical that you would allow a person to select an SRI/ESG option in a non-retirement account and then forbid them that freedom of choice in a retirement account. And if they were concerned about administrators using a social agenda to start the choices...well, my 401K at work is full of high expense ratio actively managed funds (with no SRI/ESG option) when they should be offering a few of those alongside a set of inexpensive index funds.

Right now is a good opportunity to look at the EV and Microgrid sector with some detailed research and decide if investing in this field should fit your portfolio for a long hold. Clean energy is supported at a level it finally deserves with the current U.S. Government Administration. The recent sell-off in clean energy was a needed correction, but companies like Novonix will be severely undervalued soon in being that they are working to support the growing demand for Lithium-ion technology and the resources to support it. China is major competition, but either way you look at it, they may not have enough resources to support their own transition to EV and Microgrid clean energy within the next few years.

This past year has been one hell of a year for this retailer. The pandemic was a driving factor for the growth we saw take place this year with Chewy adding over **5 million new users**. They reported positive growth quarter after quarter leading up to the pandemic (they were poised for success and executed perfectly), in addition to a hopeful outlook on customer retention moving forward as a result of covid. Who wants to switch back to lugging bags of pet food around? They will also benefit from the generational ""trendiness"" of the company as they continue to grow and expand their services. 

""Just order from Chewy"". I remember my dad always telling me to ""just order from amazon"" whenever I wanted something I could not find in stores. He would also advocate for using the service due to their unbeatable prices. The fast delivery was but a bonus as I would have preferred to go to the store and buy my item right away (if it was something I was excited about/wanted). I guess my point here is that pet food really is not all that exciting. It is more of a necessity than a want. If Chewy can compete with in store prices, who in their right mind would go out for pet food? Just order from Chewy and forget about it right? Amazon was but a book store....

# In the works....

**Compounding -** this is service offered by Chewy's pharmacy where they customize pet medications to meet specific needs of individual pets. Some animals can only take certain medications in a liquid form or require very specific doses or formulations of a particular drug. Their pharmacy will formulate these medications to meet a vets request for a pet and can deliver said formulation for consumption. They plan to eventually offer this service directly to vets so they can offer the service to their ""in house"" patients. 

**Connect with a vet -** pretty self explanatory but has more implications than meets the eye....once they have the ability to consolidate their customers needs into one service, hopefully their own service, I believe the revenue jump will be huge. 

&#x200B;

**- Some key figures -**

>**2.8% in net sales increase per customer ($363/customer)**  
>  
>**5 mil new users added in 2020 (40% increase YOY)**  
>  
>**25.5 gross margin (increase by 180-basis points as they spend less on customer acquisition and see an increase in brand recognition)**  
>  
>**Free Cash Flow positive at 32.9 mil compared to -12.8 mil the year before**  
>  
>**Net Cash from operating activities up to 63.4 mil from only 1.6 mil the year before** 

&#x200B;

Ownership is an interesting topic here. Back in 2019 Chewy was acquired by BC Partners who also owns PetSmart. They own approximately 63% of the company. BC Partners acquired Chewy as a strategic move after seeing revenues slip due to losing market share to the online retailer. Chewy is NOT a subsidiary of PetSmart or vice versa. BC Partners own each of them separately. 

Technical Analysis - consolidation in the 50-60 price range was very strong...this is where i started my position and have been tracking support and resistance for some time now familiarizing myself with the stocks movements. The price peak back in September to around 75 created a strong level for us to monitor. The 75 resistance was broken, followed by strong price action to the upside. We are now coming back down to test the 75 level for new support before pushing higher. The weekly chart is in play, using the 180/200 ma as a buy level. 

Chewy was modelled with Amazon in mind. The CEO stated that he used the 1997 letter to shareholders by Jeff Bezos to model the building of his company. This has proven to be very true as they offer 1-2 day delivery for orders over $50, prices beat out brick and mortar stores, the bonuses and discounts for signing up and sticking with them, as well as their expansion into different fields of pet care. Chewy customer service is outstanding, something not even Amazon can compete with for the time being. The personalization is second to none. Chewy also has a 1 year return window vs Amazon's 1 month window. Chewy's pharmacy is something Amazon does not have. Amazon may sell flee or tick medications, but they do not fill scripts. With purchase experience varying with Amazon from one experience to the next due to different dealings with vendors and individual sellers, the experience for the customer at Chewy is one Amazon simply can not compete with. 

We may see some minor pull back in revenues as the 2020 surge may be hard to keep up with. Will this effect the stock price in a negative way? Possibly. But i doubt it. I believe this is being priced in as we speak. The long term outlook does not change. I believe this company will continue to grow over time and will continue to increase their margins and revenues.",['AMZN']

Would say 2020 is a banner year for Chewy — lockdown + Chewy’s ability to grab market share in recent years contributed to strong revenue growth. But why is EPS still negative? At the same level of maturity even AMZN would have already turned a profit

Imo many of the drivers propelling revenue growth will start to reverse and with the pet food market being just this large, upside is capped, unless they manage to expand into other aspects of pet care and do well there too.

I have a pretty high risk tolerance due to time but would ideally prefer to have some ‘safe’ investments to balance it out [currently thinking to buy some index ETFS?], and I have no current holdings or debt.

A parent is letting me use their Robinhood account [not the best but I can really only afford mostly fractional shares]. Obviously planning to read more before I start, but I’m interested to hear your thoughts!",['MO']

After some buzz in media with some quite heavy players investing I thought I'd reach out too see if I could join in. Seeing as I'm no millionaire this will be one of the few times I'm able to particiapte. I belive in their business model bigly and honestly think they have a very good chance of succeeding.

Up until now I've only invested in stocks and mutual funds so when it comes to investing in privately-held companies what pitfalls and financial key metrics should I look at / ask them?

The company today:

* Current outstanding shares: 6m
* Implied equity value: 23m USD

They are about to initiate another round of funding, this will be a large round where they are trying to raise 440m USD since they are scaling up substatntionally from local to national distribution and sales in order to supply demand , if sucessfull it will change the numbers to:

* Outstanding shares: 15.5m
* Estimated valuation: 440m USD

Estimated earnings/projections look good but what specific answers should I ask them before jumping the gun and what key metrics should I try and calculate?",

The third question you should be asking yourself is what is the exit plan. Going public? Acquisition? Selling your shares back? Profit sharing? 

Beyond that, you need to see audited books, projected sales, general business plan etc. You need counsel and accounting. Do these shares come with voting rights? Are you already under NDA? How easily can the product and/or business model be copied and improved upon? What have they identified as gaps?

Towards the end of 2020 however, the Antitrust division did sue to block the merger between [Visa](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/V:NYSE) and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). And this morning, news was released on a [new investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-investigating-visa-over-debit-card-practices-11616164525?mod=latest_headlines), dropping VISA's stock again.  

The current Administration is [making Antitrust enforcement a greater focus](https://www.wired.com/story/lina-khan-ftc-antitrust-biden-administration/) over at least the next 4 years. Recently, a lot of focus has been placed on the rising rates of the 10-year treasury, the spiking Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500, and the post-COVID new normal run up of Tech stocks. All these are certainly large contributing factors in recent market activity, but could the greater focus on antitrust activity be having a larger than expected impact as well?   


Supporting this idea, [Apple](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AAPL:NASDAQ) is down nearly 18% from its peak over the last year. Countering this idea, [Facebook](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FB:NASDAQ?window=1Y) is on its way back up towards its 52-week peak.   


What does everyone think? Is increased focused on impactful antitrust enforcement contributing to the recent drop, especially in Tech? Will small and medium Tech and Financial stocks see any boost relative to those with massive market capitalization? Or is this all not having much of a market impact at all, and we'll see even Visa's and Apple's stocks jump back up later in the year?","['NDAQ', 'FB', 'AAPL', 'SPGI']"

Simply put, it’s one with a high P/E \[price-to-earnings ratio\].”

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

Greetings

**The narrative**

1. Chinese   energy production by source: Coal 58% Petro 20% Hydro 8% LNG 8%   Renewable 5%  Nuclear 2%. Renewables have had an amazing 10 years with   explosive growth, Liquids and Nuclear growth is more modest but Nuclear   curve is steeper. The general consensus is that renewables have a cap   due to commodity pricing. Also production is volatile and cannot serve   as the backbone without significant energy storage (again commodity   pricing affecting a great deal)[General reference](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/CHN) and [deep dive](https://cnpp.iaea.org/countryprofiles/China/China.htm)
2. Emissions  targets for China: Increase and peak at 2030 and net 0 by  2060.Personally,  I find these targets unachievable, but if China meets  them, that will  not be the only miracle they've achieved in the past  100 years.Some background [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/energy-transition/121020-china-zero-carbon-target-2060-emissions-fossil-fuels)
3. There's  broad acceptance of nuclear power and social push for it's adoption.  This is mainly fueled by a generation of urban Chinese citizens  experiencing the explosive growth and pollution that comes with (similar  to 19th century Europe) check this [here](https://www.163.com/dy/article/G4Q5UPCP0538IN0P.html)
4. Technology:  No references here but I'd like to mention that technological  disruptions in more efficient energy storage and renewables are a  macro-threat to nuclear's market share. However the biggest disruptor  for the Uranium market would be a more efficient method of enrichment.

**The fundamentals**

1. CNNC  is the main vehicle for the Nuclear business end to end in China and  their only Nuclear technology export vehicle ""CNNC has  a complete  nuclear technology industrial system, including natural  uranium  exploration and mining, nuclear fuel manufacturing, nuclear  power  technology research and development, engineering design and   construction, equipment manufacturing, as well as the entire nuclear   fuel cycle and back-end radioactive waste treatment and disposal.

Is  it overvalued?How do you expect the corporation's performance if  Uranium spot and long-term contract prices increase?Would you  invest?Would you rather get an ETF with overall exposure or other  individual miner stocks?  


My  background: New to the channel and to reddit, I was brought here by  crypto.I  am looking into subject company, considering that the net-0  emissions  targets are only possible by nuclear energy. I have always  admired the clean and cheap features of nuclear energy, I always  supported it and I anticipate it's golden era.Now, on investing, I would  like your take on  this company, and to initiate discussions which will  circle knowledge  through.Bear in mind that there are some restrictions  to investing in  this company if you are an American at the time of  writing.Last, I  want to avoid the trap of replicating the returns i got  from crypto.

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much, it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

m7icf1,grd5s0u,investing,comment,1616078801,Incredible.  I already posted this below your original post: it reads like the script for a Netflix docuseries.,['NFLX']
m7icf1,grfndun,investing,comment,1616118377,"I'm convinced, I bought April 16th puts and shorted their shares. Regarding the risks, I've managed them in this way: 

1. I shorted the shares. I received the money up front. If their stock tanks, and trading is frozen, wonderful. I'm already up. 
2. I covered my shorts with an out of the money call at a risk in can sustain in case they prop up the stock through manipulation.  Also, 
3. I purchased puts. Worst case scenario, I'm out the money on their puts. 
4. Bonus, if the company actually invents a a breakthrough blockchain product that operates at a reasonable cost, my out of the money calls are probably going to pay for my shorts and my puts. 

If I'm missing a risk here or made a miscalculation lemme know, I would definitely appreciate it.  

This definitely smells fishy. I've tried to their call their investor relations office. No answer. I've left messages, no call back. I've emailed them. No email back. Thats all that their american investor relations office.

Reddit /shorts should be a thing. If 4chan can figure out where Shia Lebeouf's flag was by divining bird calls and viewing portions of the night sky, surely fin reddit and fin twitter can start finding hard evidence that these companies are bullshit. 

We probably need to figure out how to engage Chinese people to help with the due diligence process. Some people on finreddit are enough to drive interest, but we need people who understand how the chinese internet & financial systems work to be able to due better due diligence.   

Has anyone here independently confirmed that their ecommerce shopping mall actually isn't functional? I would have had to create an account, and probably use a vpn to try to create an order, and I haven't done gone that far down the rabbit hole. 

I can reverse my position at any time at a minor loss. What I'd like to see is the company come out and address these claims.  Show the blockchain technology. 

Next, I watched China Hustle last night, and they mentioned that they were able to find Chinese data using the the SIAC findings. I have no idea where to go to find that. These companies are least subject to Chinese law, do they have to report anything there? Can we find it? 

Hypothetically, if we found Chinese filings of financial information on any of the companies they purport to have material agreements with, those would help triangulate and find evidence of fraud. Also - if we can find any Chinese filings of financial information about FTFT itself, and that evidence directly contrasts with the SEC information, that alone could spark a catalyst to cause the share rout I want to see. 

Last, but most importantly, I will feel some remorse for having played a part in pulling the rug out from under the everyday person who has invested their capital in this company. As for the people that blatantly promoting this stock as a get rich quick scheme without having done ANY due diligence... there's probably a special place ready for you in life's wheel. 

Due Diligence Performed Thus Far: Reviewed all sec filings going back to 2019. Reviewed most of their Florida company filings on [sunbiz.org](https://sunbiz.org). Visited their Website, but did not attempt to place an order. Attempted to search for the location of their Chinese offices and due to my ignorance cannot find them, I need a tutorial on their address system...  

Other Information: They had a PR release this morning on a joint venture. I haven't started down that due diligence path, but can anyone find evidence on that specific company, or any of the other companies actually exist? So far the trend is, announce a definite material agreement, then cancel it in an effort to keep the share price afloat. 

Looking forward to seeing the stock price go to less than a $1.",['TWTR']

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

m72q6s,,investing,post,1615994303,"eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive marketI've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['PYPL', 'ETSY', 'AMZN', 'EBAY']"

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['FB', 'AMZN', 'EBAY']"

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

m71yzd,,investing,post,1615992262,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates **TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

With the massive influx of people into ""reddit investing"" I assume a significant percentage to be novice (I'm trying to keep it polite). 

That being said, the less sophisticated the  investor, the more likely they would be to act ""later"" and with less regard to risk and volatility. And yet I believed they WOULD act. 

I really feel as if the last 2 months has created a FOMO phenomenon and that there is significant, traditionally irrational buying. 

I just could not figure out a way to quantify and then be able to act on it. 

You've taken my simple idea and added a brain to it.

Thank you for sharing this!

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

(Market cap calculations used for 50 years out is multiplying by 29.45, which is 1.07^50)",['SPGI']

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings.

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['PWR', 'ED']"
m6w7uv,,investing,post,1615972004,"People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.As I see it:

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

In the current environment, with so much liquidity pouring into the markets, sure, inflation is a great concern.

1. In the last 6 months, their webpage traffic has almost doubled. From 22M in September to 36M in February. More visitors to their webpage tells me that more people are interested in their products.
2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT! ([Source](https://edgar.sec.report/CIK/0001066923)) They have also gone under the name of Cyber Public Relations! ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock. ([Source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/financial-services-technology-corporate-news-greater-china-products-and-services-ownership-changes-6e1794f0cf96194018b5fcb3962c4c2b))

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here. ([Source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html)) Now, if we look this one up, we get a hit from ""The Grid"", some sort of yellowbook for corporations. ([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter","['NDAQ', 'MSFT', 'SBUX', 'GOOGL']"

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

[Full memo here](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['PGR', 'GPS']"

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.

Efficiency also isn't a binary, it exists within gradients in all markets - so something like large cap stock is far more efficient than junk debt, but both are less efficient than treasuries.  Still the idea that efficiency is a perfect condition that exists magically simply isn't a reality.

m6zzhm,,investing,post,1615986444,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['TXN', 'ARKK', 'MMM', 'IBM', 'BA', 'TER', 'INTC', 'QCOM', 'NVDA']"

""What's the market cap?""

""What's that?  I just told you it's 250.""

""Uhhh?""

""Again, it's 250.  So cheap!  It was $300 previously.""

Now, everyone here knows this, so this isn't a 101 lesson at all.  Instead, it's the term that's been coined, that's call the 'Apple stock analogy'.

Companies are notoriously difficult to price.  You have to know all the complex financials, their current and future product line, their management team competencies, the trends in the industry, etc.  I must admit that I've *never* invested in a stock, knowing all of these things *well*.  Particularly the management team competency.  Imagine that it takes month to learn how amazing a coworker is.  What kind of time investment would it take to vet managers from other companies that you've never met?  How do you access information about them?  How much time would it take?  Perhaps you've read their book?  But how much research goes on here for most investors?  Is the information reliable, or is it hyped?  In any case, the point is, it's hard to properly value a company, which is the opposite of a piece of fruit.

That's where apples come in.  Most people generally know the ballpark value of an apple for their location  It's easy to price.  In California, where I live, it's not unreasonable to pay $0.50 to $1.50 for a single apple.  Let's say $1.  Then, it becomes easy to illustrate the absurdity of things.  

""Hey, apples were $300 yesterday.  They are $250 today.  You should buy cause it's so cheap.""

""What, $250 is ridiculous for an apple....that's not worth it.""

""Exactly.""

Anyway, that's the 'Apple Stock Analogy'.  

Now, all that said, the reality is that people are buying $250 apples, left and right.  And then $300.  And then $350.  If apples were going up 10% a month, after how many months would you notice? When would you finally buy in?  When would it be worth it and a fair price for an apple?  Interesting thought questions.

But the talk of FOMO, greed, draw of easy money, broad access to investing through simplified mobile apps, layers of hidden data, hype, fundamentals, value investing, dogpiling, cycles, big players, scored earth, pumping/dumping, and how all these things can affect the market, and how investors should consider them, are totally different topics.

Good luck out there, be careful, and have fun.",['AAPL']

The only thing I care about is buying securities at better than a 20% to 50% discount to their fair value vis-à-vis discounted cash flow analysis.  That is an objective metric... it doesn't matter who performs the math.  The math is the math.

I don't get excited.  I don't get depressed.  I don't get impatient.

I think this is the new paradigm. 

For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars.

> I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars.

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

> I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets.

Is there a Vanguard index fund that encompasses his description of Asian/Chinese emerging markets?
Is VXUS good for this?

Alibaba's internet browser has been removed from several app stores in China, according to a report from The Financial Times on Tuesday.

Android app stores including those operated by Huawei, Xiaomi and Tencent have reportedly blocked downloads or removed Alibaba's ""UC Browser."" CNBC was unable to immediately confirm the report.

It comes after the UC Browser was criticized on a TV show about misleading online medical advertising that was broadcast by CCTV, a state-owned broadcaster.

It comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that Beijing's crackdown on large technology firms was just beginning. ""Some platform companies' development is not standard and risks exist,"" Xi said in an address to China's top economic committee, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

It happens every year. It's been a events for many years. As a Chinese I can tell you it's very common that some big company get some small punishment during this period.

 I check the reason UC browser got deleted from app store is they advertise fake medicines(the drug promise lower blood sugar, or losing weight but it's all bullshit) and that's illegal in China. Not only BABA's app got deleted they are many other app got warning. Including 360(a big cyber security company), multiple job searching app, ford(transmission problem), Infiniti(transmission problem), Kohler, Max Mara(install face recognition camera in their store to analyze customer), and many other companies.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-march-25.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures turn lower after Fed chief Powell comments

> * U.S. stock futures turned lower Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition” that Covid economic stimulus and vaccinations allowed the U.S. economy to recover faster than expected and that central bankers, at some point, may be able to pull back emergency support.

> * Late-day selling reversed gains and dragged the S&P 500 down 0.6% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped lower in the final seconds of Wednesday’s session. The Nasdaq dropped 2% after a slightly higher open gave way to a day of selling. Tech stocks were lower despite the 10-year Treasury yield holding below recent a 14-month high as a market rotation out of high-flying growth names continued. The Nasdaq last closed at a record last month. The Dow and S&P 500 last closed at record highs last week.

> * The Labor Department is set to report its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the stock market opens. Economists expect 735,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down 35,000 from the prior week, which saw an unexpected jump even as many states relaxed Covid mitigation restrictions on businesses.

*****

> # 2. AstraZeneca revises Covid vaccine data with lower efficacy rate

> * AstraZeneca late Wednesday issued updated Covid vaccine numbers from its late-stage trial in the U.S. and Latin America after U.S. health officials earlier this week questioned the accuracy of preliminary data. The U.K.-based drug giant now said its vaccine is 76% effective in protecting against symptomatic cases of virus. A release issued on Monday reported an efficacy rate of 79%. AstraZeneca reiterated its two-shot regimen was “well tolerated” among participants and no safety concerns were identified.

*****

> # 3. Biden to hold first news conference of presidency

> * The White House announced Thursday that it’s dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural communities. More than 25% of the entire U.S. population received at least one vaccine dose, including 14% who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two shots, while Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is only one shot.

> * Against the backdrop of rising Covid cases in many states and more than 30 million total U.S. infections, President Joe Biden is set to hold his first news conference. He’s expected to point to a surge in vaccinations, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the latest sweeping stimulus package. He’s also likely to face a wide range of questions from U.S.-Mexico border security to gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia.

*****

> # 4. Oil prices slide as Covid concerns outweigh Suez Canal disruptions

> * Oil prices fell Thursday as fuel demand concerns re-emerged alongside worries about steps back in the global fight against Covid. Prices of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude and the Brent international benchmark each dropped roughly 2%, one day after they both surged nearly 6% on the crude shipping disruptions caused by the grounding of a giant container ship in the Suez Canal, a major trade route. It could “take weeks” to clear, according to the CEO of a Dutch company helping with the salvage efforts.

*****

> # 5. Lawmakers to press tech CEOs over speech, misinformation

> * Big Tech leaders Thursday are scheduled to testify at a virtual House panel hearing on efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns Google and YouTube, will face increased pressure following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the rise in Covid vaccine misinformation. There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted online.

> **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** – The chip maker’s stock rose 1% in premarket trading after Northland Capital Markets upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “market perform.” Northland called Intel’s (INTC) move to re-enter the foundry business as a “strategic faux pas” and said AMD stood to benefit as a result.

I thought my $8 call was going to expire worthless because it had dropped to the $9 range yesterday. 
But today proved me wrong. When it had continous growth all morning around $9, I excercised my $11 put and got $1100. Then when it hit around $10 later, I excercised my $8 call and bought back those 100 shares and earned an extra $300.

mcwq8v,,StockMarket,post,1616674124,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ($TSM) - Full DD w/ Price Targets**Hey there investors! In this post I am going to share with you my Due Diligence on the biggest semiconductor foundry in the world, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company!**

**\[Very Long Post\]**

# What’s the story of the company?

[TSM](https://imgur.com/0IJCk3R) is the biggest chip foundry to provide 7 & 5 nanometer chips that became very popular after Apple moved their chip design in-house. Apple isn’t the only company that works with TSM with other big names like AMD, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Qualcomm and even companies that also build their own chips like INTEL & NXP use TSM do increase their capacity.

Late last year the company also received approval to build a $12B chip plant in Phoenix, which will be a welcomed by the US, as chip demand has far outpaced the supply currently available around the world.

I know it might sound weird, but guys, in my opinion, I believe this $500B [company](https://imgur.com/gMPb0Pb) which has risen by more than 150% in the last year after the 2020 lows, still has some room to grow 

# Competition & Product 

I believe that TSM has a great advantage compared to companies that operate in their industry, as they have invested huge amounts of money in capital expenditures to gain competitive advantages compared to Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments, Broadcom & others.

We can also take a look at what Seeking Alpha Quant Factor [grades](https://imgur.com/KIQyCtO) the company, and we can see that TSM does pretty good in all 5 categories, Value, Growth, Profitability, Momentum & EPS Revisions.

One other thing we can see here, is that after the huge spike in price, the dividend yield of the company still has room to recover, as the 4-year average yields stands at over 3%, second only to Qualcomm

# MOAT – Easy to replicate? Branding value? Dominance over Marketplace? TAM?

You are also probably wondering what is the MOAT of the company? Do they have a branding value or some kind of dominance over the Marketplace?

Well, from my point of view, TSM has a significant MOAT against most of its competition as they’ve been able to collect huge amounts of knowledge from its diverse base of over 500 customers which have helped them leap ahead of other companies since the 7NM move in 2018.

TSM pretty much [supplies](https://imgur.com/l5ekttM) all the big companies I mentioned earlier which later pass on the technology to their customers, so it’s very likely that you are using one of their chips in some of your devices, maybe your iPhone, your car, computer or anything else.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/M9MMUfn), the MOAT TSM has over Intel, as Intel is still a long way back, working on older generation chips, while TSM is leading the pack.

I believe their market dominance in the 7NM & 5NM chips will continue to keep TSM as the preferred manufactured for most fabless companies just like Apple which currently [represents](https://imgur.com/TkAR5kR) over 20% of TSM revenues, it seems to me that TSM is the best foundry to own for the next decade, as the worldwide revenue of semis [topped](https://imgur.com/X9iqLlY) $40B to start 2021, with [TSM](https://imgur.com/3unNxtB) being the only one of its pears to see a significant growth, with a big chunk of that coming from the huge demand Apple will provide them for the 5NM chips, which accounts for over 50% of their 5NM [sales](https://imgur.com/OyfFsEN).

Friends, this is just my opinion, but I even dare to say that their total addressable market it’s pretty much limitless in the foreseeable future.

Semiconductors are here to stay as technology will only continue to evolve, with smaller & smaller chips in the future and competitors still struggling to catch up with the 5NM technology that TSM already has, so TSM should be poised to remain one of the biggest companies in the world for the foreseeable future

I believe now is the time we need to get to some of the company’s financials & metrics

# Company Growth & Balance Sheet

Revenue/ Net Income Growth? Profitability?

Let’s start by taking a [look](https://imgur.com/mvUGLnO) at how the companies revenues and gross profit have evolved in the past years, and we can see that with the exception of 2018, TSM has seen a continued growth with 2020 being a booming year as gross profit increased by more than 50% with operating income also increasing by more than 60%, which in my eyes is pretty remarkable given the size of the company.

[TSM](https://imgur.com/jHWdJrY) has managed to post a positive net income in the last 10 years, seeing an increase of over 400% in that same period, so, I hold the opinion that this will continue on the same path for the next 10 years as well 

# Cash / Debt / Net Debt & Dilution

Looking at the balance [sheet](https://imgur.com/MUCFRtx) of the company, we also find that TSM has an excellent financial situation, with over $38B in current assets, which can easily pay off the $22B in current liabilities or the $32B in total current & long-term [liabilities](https://imgur.com/kE1mKDV), so the company is way more than solvent.

# Lastest Earnings Reports & Predictions of Revenue Streams / Cost of Sales & Others

It seems to me that TSM [posted](https://imgur.com/mmqloyJ) some terrific numbers yet again in Q4 of 2020, delivering almost $13B in revenues up 22% YoY with 5NM technology already accounting for 20% of wafer revenue as the 5G technology and super-cycle is just starting, with telecom companies struggling to keep up with the increasing demand.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/ZGM9b2N) that the 5NM was already the 2nd biggest revenue stream for the company in the 4th quarter and I would say that it’s pretty likely only going to increase, as this only accounted for 8% of 2020’s [revenues](https://imgur.com/RJmakFU), especially as Smartphone [account](https://imgur.com/B7UHPHO) for almost half of TSM revenues from last year, with only the automotive sector seeing a small decline, which was expected, but should recover in the next years, as cars had a bad year given the events of 2020 and they will also very likely contain more & more chips as companies continue to innovate.

TSM also provided a revenue guidance similar to last quarter as gross profit margins are still expected to come in at over 50% 

# Dividends?

One last thing that we should look at before moving on to future projections is how the company is continuing to growth their [dividend](https://imgur.com/Kxhyy2b). 

As far as I am concerned, dividend investing is not really my favorite but this is an important thing to look at when looking for companies to buy to maintain a balanced portfolio.

TSM only offers a $1.79 dividend but this has seen a 13.5% growth rate in the past 5 years and given that things are only getting better, I think this can continue as well.

I guess now’s the time to move on to what is the current upside and the long-term potential for TSM

# Current Upside / Long Term Upside?

First, let’s start with my [expectations](https://imgur.com/r87yUGF) of the revenue streams, costs of goods, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

I believe we can continue to see a steady growth in their total sales, that will end up doubling by 2025, reaching over $108B. On the other side, I also believe we can continue to see a gross margin of 54%, similar with what we saw last quarter.

The other operating expenses from R&D and SG&A I pretty much expect to remain the same, as this has been steady over the years, so, a 2.7% of the revenues should go in SG&A and 8.3% should continue to go into continued R&D to keep the companies MOAT.

I would say that TSM is very likely to continue to invest a lot of money in Capex to keep up with the increasing semiconductors demand, so this should continue to grow at around 2.5%/year.

All of these numbers should get us an operating income of almost $27B for 2025, though, there are other things like interest income & expenses that we should account for, but for TSM, this should add up to a slight gain of $400M in 2025.

Finally the effective tax rate of the [company](https://imgur.com/pkOEifS), has stood under 12% for the last 3 years, but, for safety reasons I will imply a small increase each year, which would [result](https://imgur.com/KbtxhZG) in TSM having a net income of just over $24B in 2025, paying out a dividend of $3.24, while also not diluting their shares, as TSM hasn’t [diluted](https://imgur.com/oflEVtF) their stock significantly since 2005.

# Price to Earnings (PE) Valuation

PE Valuations are my favorite way to quickly & pretty accurately determine reasonable future prices for stocks. 

Taking into account all the numbers we went through earlier, my [view](https://imgur.com/gwgvpXI) is that we can see TSM trading anywhere between a 25 and a 40 PE by 2025, which given the $4.64 EPS for 2025 would mean the stock can trade between $116 and $185, but, before moving on to the final price targets let’s also take a quick look at TSM discounted free cash flow valuation.

# DCF 

I [implied](https://imgur.com/hNWP9E2) the same growth rate for TSM revenues and actually lowered their EBIT as a % of their revenues each year by .5%, and after taking into account their effective tax rate, their D&A, capital expenditures and net working capital I arrived at a $71.5B free cash flow by 2025.

As always I also added their net assets and used a 3% long-term growth rate just to be conservative and for the perpetuity approach we got a price target of $86, meaning the company is potentially overvalued at the moment, though, on the other hand, the EBITDA approach, using a 20x multiplier, would results in a price target of $178. 

I like to use an average approach of this numbers, which would results in a price target of $132, or a 21% upside in the next 12 months for the company, not including any additional dividends received.

# Technical Chart

Looking at a short-term [chart](https://imgur.com/qgvPpXM), we find that TSM is pretty underbought right now with an RSI of 36, but the volumes in the stock are slightly increasing.

It seems to me that the next support level for TSM stands at $103 while the next resistance is just above my 12-month price target for the company, as TSM had a fake breakout over $135 in the middle of last month.

# Wall St. Opinion

I always take a look after I’ve finished my DD to what analysts say, and in this case, they have a $137 PT for the [company](https://imgur.com/xAVfqN4) slightly higher than my own DD, so it seems I was pretty accurate with my expectations.

[Analysts](https://imgur.com/l6EndWo) also expect a 72B on average, while my estimates are the top end of their range, but on the other hand, I only have an EPS of 4.64$ in 2025, compared to $5.6 expected by them by 2023.

# Weaknesses

When looking at what companies you should invest in, it’s recommended to also take into account their potential weaknesses.

I have no doubt that TSM does have some weaknesses, but probably the biggest one is that they really so much on their Apple revenues, though, it’s hard to believe Apple will move away from TSM anytime soon, or even if that happens that TSM won’t find other customers in need of their products in a short period of time, especially now with the huge worldwide chip shortage.

While writing this post, we also received [news](https://imgur.com/MCjAWXZ) from INTEL that they are planning on building 2 new foundries in Arizona. This might provide even more pressure on the current price of TSM, but, in my humble opinion, i think this just more buzz, with Intel still laggining behind in technology, not even having the 7NM available, while TSM is already working on 2 & 3NM developments. So, i'd take this as another opportunity to ""buy the dip""

# Short Selling? Institutional Holding?

The company has such a solid future that the percentage of [shares](https://imgur.com/wl06zGs) sold on the short side is under .3%, which is one of the lowest I have ever seen in a company.

Though, on the other hand, the stock isn’t that largely [owned](https://imgur.com/ndoKXcs) by institutions, with JP Morgan leading the pack with under 1%, buy, my guess is that’s because this isn’t a US based company, which does make it less attractive to big investment banks & funds.

I bet that you are just waiting to see the final price targets and my final opinion, so let’s jump to that right now

# Final Opinion & Prediction!

In my [opinion](https://imgur.com/P7OQKtb), TSM is a must have stock in most portfolios, brining some balance, with good growth ahead of it. TSM might helped lower the beta of most portfolios that are way to heavy on the overhyped tech stocks right now.

Remember, this is just my humble opinion as a retail investor, this is not an investment advice, but my view is that we can see TSM moving towards the $132 range by early next year, with TSM likely to be jump-started again around their next [earnings](https://imgur.com/ClXzJZG) report in April 

Regarding the long-term [view](https://imgur.com/dgQTLy7), my base TSM target is $150 by 2025, meaning an ROI of 38% which is not that great, but when taking into account the expected dividends received from TSM, that can jump to over 50% 

Speaking personally, my 2025 Price [Targets](https://imgur.com/9ZWdcb5) for TSM range from an average of the 25 & 30 PE multiple, my base case from the 30 & 35, while my bull case averages de 35 & 40 PE multiple prices.

If you used the correct term, competitive advantage, then it would be obvious that they can't meet demand, and Intel is building fabs in Arizona to compete with them, and all they have is good market share.

Calling it a ""moat"" is when a company has something extra that you can't take away; like Apple dedicated fanbois. Another company can't do anything to take that advantage away, or to get people to be as dedicated to them. Not happening. So people started calling it a ""moat."" Few companies have anything like that.

The American companies that sell TSM their factory equipment... also sell it to other companies. It isn't even their IP that makes what they do possible. They have market share, and it is going to decline, even as their own output remains at capacity. That's just the way it is.","['IP', 'INTC', 'AAPL']"

📷

Put your helmets on and buckle up its coming... A roller coaster ride of volatility. Yesterday we had a move of 5.2 points on the spy nearly straight down, and most of it was done with a positive advance decline line. Now consider with all the movement we have had this week are just below where we started the week. The market makers expected move is 396.8 at the top and 382.16 at the bottom, there is a high probability we tag one of those numbers by or before expiration Friday.   That means a huge move today and or tomorrow. The upcoming roller coaster ride will be different, usually roller coasters have a slow tick, tick, tick up then screaming down. The roller coaster the market is about to ride is going to go screaming up then a nice orderly pace down for a good while. This could start today or next week not completely sure but get ready it seems to be on the way which is surprising with the amount of stimulus/ liquidity floating around. In my estimation I though the stimulus would have kept this from coming for months but it's still possible this could be a tremor before the real earthquake move which could still be months away. Now what to expect today, try to identify day structure early we have a trend down day structure setting up so here are the possible outcomes for today.1) Trend day down model set up, at some point we get a have hearted try to fill the gap of yesterdays close of 387.48 and fail to a likely target of 382 area 2) Rounded reversal set up (Trange day). We head straight down toward 382area where we see a turnaround erasing a good bit of the losses of the day. Consolidate between 388 and 393 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. 3) We hold and consolidate between 385 and 388 area before breaking higher or lower. 

1) Trend day down model set up, at some point we get a have hearted try to fill the gap of yesterdays close of 387.48 and fail to a likely target of 382 area. **50% probability** 

2) Rounded reversal set up (Trange day). We head straight down toward 382area where we see a turnaround erasing a good bit of the losses of the day. Consolidate between 388 and 393 area before getting up enough energy to break out higher or lower. **40% probability** 

3) We hold and consolidate between 385 and 388 area before breaking higher or lower. **10% probability**",['GPS']

mceny3,,StockMarket,post,1616614915,"I’ve analyzed the websites of the top 3000 public companies and their traffic. Here are the ones whose traffic is growing the most dynamically.I don’t know how useful this information will be to you, but I see some interesting underrated stocks on this list. Hope it will help you too.

TL;DR: $SAVA, $RIOT, $OCGN, $PNM, $MTCH

**1.** **Cassava Sciences Inc. ($SAVA) -** biopharmaceutical company focused on neuroscience. Traffic has increased due to the rapid progress in the development of a drug from Alzheimer’s disease.

[$SAVA](https://preview.redd.it/afk25x4p31p61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cc0e55b5fc499d0703a6059ac78361fef35b1)

**2. Riot Blockchain Inc. ($RIOT)** \-  bitcoin mining company which maintains bitcoin blockchain. Everything is quite obvious here - the company is associated with bitcoin, so the more world’s interest in bitcoin - the more interest in $RIOT (just my opinion, perhaps the reason is different).

[$RIOT](https://preview.redd.it/heezniou31p61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=453457a1849fbfcebabccbabacce7f7564735d97)

**3. Ocugen Inc. ($OCGN)** \- same as for $SAVA, it’s a biopharmaceutical company. I think the traffic has increased due to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.

&#x200B;

[$OCGN](https://preview.redd.it/j2cjgrny31p61.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc20bb16869b23ae6f090273cd413cfc2404a264)

4. **PNM Resources Inc. ($PNM)** \- electricity provider, energy holding company. The reason for the sharp increase in website’s traffic is not clear to me here. Apparently these guys know how to do their business.

&#x200B;

[$PNM](https://preview.redd.it/hcpgkoz341p61.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=7817a451d49404f61f6c8347a23bf4f4fce90439)

5. **Match Group Inc. ($MTCH) -** The reasons for the traffic’s growth are not obvious here as well. Most likely it grows organically.

[$MTCH](https://preview.redd.it/ms5y7ka841p61.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f03ef31019086fbd983b2e7ba562e3b31cb9420)

I do not have clear statistical evidence that the traffic to the website is related to the stock price, but following the usual logic - if the website’s traffic has increased by more than 1000 times, then it may affect the stock’s price.",

It may not be a huge deal for someone who bought in during the 2020 crash or a few years ago. Even if you were just to have bought into S&P 500 now, you're likely down, possibly by a significant enough amount of money. So it may be relatively benign to you, but to a new investor they likely just entered the market with their savings and have now lost thousands of those savings in an environment where news orgs and big name investors are telling them that there's an impending crash. 

So as much as people like to complain about new investors being annoying, this is actually a very bad situation for them where they don't know how much money they'll lose and have only experienced loss.",['SPGI']

mchh87,,StockMarket,post,1616622067,"The mental struggle for new investorsThis post is for new investors struggling with the mental side of investing. I've personally never seen the market this volatile, and with the little experince I have, I'd like to post my rules for investing.

Half the battle with stocks is the battle in your mind. I find red days, and especially the most recent weeks easier to cope with if I just stick to these rules.

&#x200B;

* **Only use funds that I would not need in an emergency** (Have savings elsewhere eg Bonds ISA's etc, don't have your entire savings into stocks, you never know when your going to need it)
* **A diverse portfolio will have it's losers** (No matter how much of a Wiz you are at the stock market your going to have a stock that fails)
* **Remember your reasoning for investing** (If your down -20% on a stock but plan to sell in 5 years it's not necessarily panic stations)
* **Sometimes it's good to go against the grain** (unpopular one this, but Paper hands will always leave you in profit)
* **sometimes your not ""too late""** (If you hear about a certain company on the news many people would assume they're to late to get involved in the stock. Do some research, sometimes it's good to follow the hype too! Don't get stuck with FOMO)
* **If you find yourself constantly looking at your phone wondering if you should hold or sell take a break**
* **Look at the percentages rather than your money** ( -6% isn't too bad, but -£1,206 looks BAD!)

Read some books about investing, I've read a few and it really does help! (The intelligent Investor is a bit outdated but it's brilliant!)

If anyone else has any advice to give about the mental side on investing feel free to post :)",

mcfiy9,,StockMarket,post,1616617064,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 24, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.

Market participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. 

After a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. 

The rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

I took a few swing positions in 5 of my favorite stocks (all growth stocks) about 10 days ago. Originally I had planned for 2-3 day swing trade. All these companies were trading at a great discount from all time highs after the market wide sell off a few weeks back. I bought in during the rally and of course it was right before the bond yield scare and current chaos plunged the NASDAQ. My entire account is tied up in these trades and I guess I could’ve managed my dollar cost averaging better but I just didn’t foresee a major market correction, especially since the market had just finished selling off a good chunk. 

I’m leaning towards holding out. Since all of my stocks have reached oversold on the RSI (of course that doesn’t mean they can’t continue to sell off) but unless we’re heading for a serious market correction it just wouldn’t make sense to cash out and buy back in.

mcf30d,,StockMarket,post,1616615979,"Robinhood files for IPO despite GameStop backlash Robinhood announced that it has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO), on Tuesday.

It’s likely that you already know what Robinhood is, due to the recent craziness on Wall Street. But if you need a refresher, it’s the trading app that many of the retail investors used to buy up stocks of GameStop, sending the stock up as much as 500%. 

Although the saga created a ton of free publicity for the zero-commission trading app, the company also came under fire from Congress for limiting its trades.

The filing comes as a bold move for the company after its rough start to the year, but perhaps it is its way of bouncing back from the bad press, and capitalizing on its enormous surge in usage—an additional 6 million in the first two months of 2021. 

The company has selected Nasdaq to list its shares on and has filed confidentially with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Other established startups, like Airbnb, Lyft, Slack and Palantir, have also filed IPOs confidentially—allowing them to keep their financial details private for the time being. 

Since its founding in 2013, Robinhood has been steadily growing its customer base, gaining 13 million users by the end of 2020. The California-based upstart pioneered zero-commission stock trading and disrupted the old-school industry of brokerage platforms like Charles Schwab, E-Trade, and Fidelity with its gamified approach to trading.

The company’s flurry of new customers has definitely gotten the attention of Wall Street lately, with its valuation rising from $12 billion in September 2020 to $20 billion by the end of the year, and then doubling to $40 billion in February 2021.

Anyways i was listening to Mad Money from Tuesday 3/23/2021 and it was very subtle but i noticed he mentioned that there will be a rotation back to tech stocks soon. Cramer mentioned around easter is when things rally. I am curious to see what happens 

In addition today and yesterday listening to Fast Money/ Squak i noticed they mentioned the same thing... but in a different way. They mentioned that PE's for ""value"" are slowly  reaching PE's of ""tech"" and that with that people are going to jump back into the tech stocks thinking they are getting a deal now which will effectively cause a rotation back to tech.

This is usually how rotations into value happen; it is a short-lived thing. But that doesn't mean the big tech stocks will re-inflate, just the ones that got left out in the cold during the rotation will recover. The correction won't evaporate, it is just that the continued influx of money into the market will put things back in an upward direction. But probably a lot more spread out now, with a continued emphasis on value; its just that it doesn't take long for it get harder to find obvious value.

Calling it a ""rotation back"" might be an over-statement, maybe it is better to just say that interest will be renewed.

mbqrgb,,StockMarket,post,1616538937,"Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, another generational bull market has begun - The ultimate silver DD. $PSLV $SILJI’ve already posted DDs on silver in WallStreetBets a couple times, but I decided to come to r/StockMarket this time because WSB is completely focused on GME at the moment. 

Note this is not a post to tell you sell your GME. I’m personally still long GME.

In fact I hope I GME hits $1000 after earnings, I salute you fellow Apes.

&#x200B;

Silver however, is the market I have done the most research for, and why I am writing this DD. 

This post is quite long so here’s the **TLDR if you are lazy:** Buy PSLV and get ready to ride the silver rocketship. Alternatively, purchase 1000oz bars of silver at premiums under 5% to ride the rocket.

Quick Bullets:

* Silver will rise dramatically due to a fundamentals-based rally in industrial and monetary demand
* A short squeeze in silver is on the precipice of occurring, and could add gasoline to a bonfire, current short interest is 513%
* SLV is a scam, if you own it then sell and purchase PSLV (and the same goes for GLD, you can buy PHYS instead)
* The banks that run the silver market have been labeled ‘criminal enterprises’ by the DOJ, for metals price manipulation, and these are the same banks entrusted with SLV/SIVR

&#x200B;

There are two types of bull markets in silver.  One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand.  The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze.  Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets. 

**I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.** 

So what are these ‘smoke alarms’ I mentioned? 

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle. 

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‘smoke’.  

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP.  More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/5yh58ntwguo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da878286af614bfa216734371b1b9c257726612

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply. 

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at.  Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver.  

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying.  In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.  

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP). 

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

 

https://preview.redd.it/h6tfe4kvguo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=64a5e124ddf99608ab11470b0492fa9642553df2

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.  

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.  

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high).  Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater).  Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested.  Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation).  This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011.  Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities.  The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period.  Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation).  There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market. 

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples.  And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms.  Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse.  Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities. 

https://preview.redd.it/77j9noo9huo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c794b8d8b8e339ebeac5757add7cf7492a8949a

I in no way think this is coming to the United States.  I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse.  Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn’t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade. 

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91.  Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs).  Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021.  Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.  

&#x200B;

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver.  Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations.  (LN scale because silver is nature’s money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out.  And there’s really no reason it must stop there.**  

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement MMT related policies with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue.  This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring.  Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more).  The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended.  What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices. 

&#x200B;

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates.  And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

 

https://preview.redd.it/dyp2056qhuo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa926d50b73015ff6106b64c546d79c60369ec6

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant.  They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed.  As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don’t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in.  Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation’s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high.  So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself.  They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high).  So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation?  The value of the dollar.  We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform). 

The other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment.  In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies.  Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation. 

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job.  The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years.  At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years. 

&#x200B;

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now.  This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too.  Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well.  There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well.  Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting.  The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates. 

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all).  How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable.  Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well. 

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors).  **The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.**  And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need?  And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It’s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver. 

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input?  Silver. Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable.  So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further. 

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon.  The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation. 

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer.  I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any.  The move back into having even a small precious metals allocation it is what drives silver up by 30x or more. 

&#x200B;

Now it is time to dive deeper into the other contributor to the silver bull market, **the short squeeze.**  

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver. 

Lets dig into the silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself. 

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity.  So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date.  Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn’t exist, then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver.  Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality. 

&#x200B;

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market.  They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass.  They only do it if they really have to.  Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery.  Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market. 

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver.  The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight.  But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers. 

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently? 

Let’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/3o4eda0zhuo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5212d0ec99fa8fadc3e87d7d97da0327f9bd9a06

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered.  This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find. 

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis. 

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is. 

https://preview.redd.it/y0zbsru0iuo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5619336c219421bc93c10be859dd581814fdb7

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic.  While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze.  The 2001-2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x.  In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.  

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0wd4lwgqkuo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf26d8204bc0817457ebe56a6354ba7ede4ad8e

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered.  It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse.  It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell. 

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort.  And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American.  If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX.  That’s how tight this market is. 

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check.  If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher. 

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract’s open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/knr5kwz7iuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07edc45ea6d245cb58ff972cc93b847861d6c6e

It looks almost unreal.  And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves.  That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/pf93niaaiuo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4835e10de33e28790f7c588858c883df25f44949

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x.  Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.  

April’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces.  20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.   

Here’s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/9qehkardiuo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeeaccab17039c03f9b8214dabfce7dea377ea18

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)?  Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May:

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lgflbrhiuo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84d4fe485a9a5a0cafeb7e6d8a40f99a88049a0

https://preview.redd.it/j3u861k0juo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee4cc550f8b790a913f7ce073ae9afe8e6f5230

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%.  Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.  

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations.  This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic.  As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.  

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough.  Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.  

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders.  The GME short squeeze may indeed return, because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can’t force them to sell. 

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, [they forced them to sell](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunt-brothers-trying-to-corner-silver-market-2016-5).  The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing silver.  There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze.  

The regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market.  Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’.  The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each.  There is no cornering the market going on.  This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them.  They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion.  Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors. 

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played? 

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.** – Unless their bluff is truly called, and short squeeze occurs. Which means that the paper supply (contract silver that exists in the form of short futures contracts) has to be bought back at far higher prices to prevent further margin calls and possible insolvency. 

When the silver squeeze began in late January, there was a flurry of media interviews and articles by experts who claimed that a retail driven short squeeze just isn’t possible.  Why were they so confident? Because the banks have owned this game since futures began trading, and retail buyers don’t purchase 1000oz bars, they tend to purchase 1oz coins.

These small unit coins and bars are produced by mints both public and private.  These mints take 1000oz bars and use them to produce smaller silver bars and coins, but there is a limit to their production capacity. In normal times a mint might produce 5 million ounces a year, and in a time like today when demand is surging maybe they run the machines 24 hours a day and pump that production up to 10 million ounces in a year.  Does this add to demand for 1000oz bars? Yes, but the amount that it can add is capped at the production capacity of the mints.  Beyond the amount production can be ramped up, demand simply pushes premiums for these small units of silver higher, rather than the price of silver itself.  The large banks who are short 1000oz bars know that demand from this channel is capped, and thus they feel perfectly safe remaining in, or even increasing their short positions when retail coin and bar demand surges. 

Once small unit silver premiums soar, the next place retail investors start to place money is in silver ETFs, primarily the SLV ETF.  This is where the real fucking over of retail silver investors starts. 

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

“In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.” – Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault.  They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it’s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX.  Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all.  So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren’t.  The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs.  Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors.  He truly meant what he said. 

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF. 

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring.  Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows.  **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.**  When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange.  As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price.  It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits.  Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out: 

 

[Reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/b8patrd4juo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=733303b57df19c5133ea50432dc6068640b543a0)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future.  What does this even mean?  Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market, that’s actually not the case.  What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market.  They will not purchase silver to accumulate additional inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to. 

&#x200B;

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong.  **Purchasing SLV is the best way for a silver investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.** 

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange.  SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural. 

For example, when millions of people buy Tesla stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise. 

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker. 

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows?  Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‘bank participation report’ which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF.  The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market.  The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021.  I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks’ net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

 

https://preview.redd.it/vydektr6juo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68f0678d992f1c30c33a84436034dbabe133f8d

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions.  What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze. 

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It’s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before the squeeze happens. 

For further evidence of this theme of, “If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall” look no further than the deliveries data itself,

https://preview.redd.it/r9jxmp28juo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bfcaa15c404d6e9be8425ea739265c17282b82

You’ll notice that as long as investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed and uptick, the price would begin to fall once again.  This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery.  Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need? 

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you’ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries.  **The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.**  

And lest you think I’m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?  

https://preview.redd.it/igxaamq4luo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a66830bff69ec316cb2c49b5fb2de495777b608

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.  Silver is the best candidate for this to occur. 

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets.  Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

 

https://preview.redd.it/ulkem3jbjuo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f30331fc8817bf081ce4b4fdf316a51765f1396

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur.  I’m not saying the silver isn’t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence? 

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?  

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery).  Further, Sprott buys its silver directly, it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace.  And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.  This is what is starting to happen right now.  And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks.  Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.  

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.  

I’d highly recommend at least some allocation to physical silver through PSLV, and actual physical bars and coins (when premiums come down to earth) as soon as possible. If you are a large player and can take delivery on the COMEX that is easily the cheapest and best route to get exposure as well. 

**Alternate plays with more risk and potential reward include silver miners, silver miner ETFs, and call options on these silver stocks.** 

**Whatever you do, don’t buy any silver ETFs that aren’t PSLV.** 

Silver is about to ride a rocket to the moon, the banks will get what they deserve, screw the suits, retail investors deserve to win for once, whether its silver or GME.  It’s time the banks played by the rules of the system like the rest of us.

So over the next few days we  exchange numbers, she shows off her nice job and how she makes a lot of  money by trading and investing. I always had some curiosity about  trading and investments but never actually got around to learning about  it so I guess I was a easy target. To start things off I invested an  initial amount of $1000 but the website seemed a bit shady, in less than  a month she helped me double my investment and my account had $2k in it  and she constantly kept saying things like how I could make a lot more  if I invested more money, kept saying things like you need to increase  your capital then you can so much more money. There were multiple red  flags and I went looking for answers. All the reviews I found of that  website are extremely negative and the final confirmation was this  website, reading the comments at the bottom was confirmation for me that  I was being scammed

It  was bad news but honestly losing $1000 was not going to kill me but all  those people in the comments probably lost more than that. Basically  they ask you to invest a small amount of money at first, then ask you to  invest in XAUUSD.m which is probably controlled by them, then they show  you how easy it is to make an insane amount of money in a short time,  they'll even let you make a withdraw but then pressure you to invest a  lot more and that's when you lose all your money.

Tried to find if there's anything on reddit about them but all I got was this

More people who got scammed and probably don't know what to do after.

As  for me I convinced her that I'm going to invest another $10,000 but I  need to see how the withdrawals work and I was able to withdraw $1500, I  had already accepted that I'll lose all my money I was just lucky that  this trick worked.

I've never thought that they would just roll over and give up control of the world by letting a bunch of rando's come up with a computer program and system.  People that finally rule the world, naturally want to keep that power.

And that gives them two ways to continue ruling and controlling ""money"" or your ability to buy food and shelter, one is to out right ""ban"" or ""outlaw"" crypto, the other would be to take the idea and co-opted it into there own.  (or both...they aren't mutually exclusive).

mclymk,,StockMarket,post,1616634273,"Lif , super high paying dividend. What am i missing here?Labrador Iron Ore Royalty (TSX:LIF) is a Canadian corporation and owns an interest in Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), which operates a major iron mine near Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador, on lands leased from Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corporation (LIORC).
Directly and through the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Hollinger-Hanna, LIORC owns a 15.10% equity interest in IOC and receives a 7% gross overriding royalty on all iron ore products produced from the leased lands sold and shipped by IOC and a $0.10-per-tonne commission on sales of iron ore by IOC.

LIORC also holds certain leases and licences covering approximately 18,200 hectares of land near Labrador City. IOC has subleased certain portions of these lands from which it currently mines iron ore. In return, IOC pays LIORC a 7% gross overriding royalty on all sales of iron ore products produced from these lands. A 20% tax on the royalty is payable to the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. For the five years prior to 2020, the average royalty net of the 20% tax was $108 million per year and in 2020 the net royalty was about $160 million.
In addition to the royalty interest, the company also owns a 15.10% equity interest in IOC. Additionally, Hollinger-Hanna has the right to receive a payment of 10 cents per tonne on the products produced and sold by IOC. Since the royalty is based on sales, LIORC’s royalty is not dependent on the profitability of IOC.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with bitcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with bitcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular cryptocurrency as a form of payment.

The formation of, xSigma Entertainment was created to acquire assets that will increase shareholder value by targeting businesses that are in growth industries, that have the ability to grow in scale, and that will allow the Company and its shareholders to realize additional growth alongside its existing core business.
--

When we look at the price on the daily chart, where one candlesticks represents one day of a price action, the trend is clearly a strong uptrend as the price on average has been increasing 15 trading days in a row!

This trend however has to break at some point and see a deeper correction as before, possibly forming another bullish formation, a good spot to potentially buy some more ZKIN shares.

When a possible correction occurs, it's forecasted to test 50 EMA, which is located at $6.50 currently! But of course it will not drop so low even if the correction starts today as the EMA is rising dynamically.

But is such correction on the horizon?

In the last bull run to $12.80, the average volume was less than 2 millions shares traded daily.

In this run, the volume is almost 5x that as today's average volume is more than 9 millions shares traded!

MACD is showing no signs of slowing down as the bullish momentum continues to extend.

But RSI is pointing towards a bearish divergence as the price is currently clearly making a new higher high while RSI is making a lower highs, so I would be aware of possible correction.

But do not worry as such correction is nothing unusual in a healthy price growth.",

So home owners will have to refinance the debt against there already over market value home if they capable ie good credit score work history etc. Or mortgage lenders will begin to charge interest and demand payment on 18 months plus of deferred payments making payments unreasonable and leading to foreclosure. Also I have seen first hand the  everyone gets approved procedure back in place for many first time buyers.

You must also factor in that states that will allow you to grow it for personal consumption.

In the short term, you can profit with some of the growers; however in my opinion, the real market are the suppliers to the growers (regulatory compliance, inventory control, pest management (like natural products from $MBII) , etc.) and the derivative market (beverages, edibles, topicals (like the CBD plays), and pharmaceutical actives) - hopefully the ETFs will cover these markets to afford maximum exposure.

mcmvzr,,StockMarket,post,1616637048,"The New Age Stock TraderTL;DR: My take on the new age of stock traders and what the world of investing looks like now and into the future. You can read the full article here: [https://maxxprofits.com/](https://maxxprofits.com/)

&#x200B;

Have you ever read, “Who Moved My Cheese?” It’s a great book that focuses on change. People are afraid of change because it takes them from that sweet comfortable spot that they’re currently in and throws them into the abyss of the unknown. Change can be hard to face and even harder to accept. Most people are pretty stubborn and it’s hard to convince them that change can be a good thing sometimes. 

The market changes every day. We see stocks go up and down, monies exchanged from one hand to the next. One thing that hadn’t really changed until recently though has been the world of investing. 

Investing in the previous decades always seemed dull and boring. You put your money here, let it relax and simmer and watch the wonderful magic of compounding happen. Occasionally something big would happen in the market. Insert Dotcom bubble. 

When I was younger I always envisioned a stock trader like a recluse held up in their office sporting nothing but whitey tighties with a cigarette hanging out the side of their mouth. There’s an old school PC and on the monitor a commodities chart is up. Whose buying all those oranges!?

It’s no secret. Time’s have changed, especially for the world of investing. We don’t have to get our stock broker on the line to place orders - we can do that right from the palm of our hand. You don’t have to order catalogs of data (that’s already borderline outdated) just to understand a company. We are fortunate to be alive and trading in the age of the internet.

If you’re like me, you’re probably subscribed to multiple investor centric subreddits and follow a few Twitter traders here and there. You might have noticed that these once stable communities have started to slowly evolve and align more with the ideals of the new-age trader. 

I see a lot of complaints from fellow redditors arguing combatively that these young traders are pouring money into shit companies that have yet to make a profit. There’s countless posts about why these companies should not be invested in and how they’re going to fail. I don’t necessarily disagree but we can’t ignore the fact that money really is getting poured in to these shit companies. 

The Days of Buffet & Bogle are behind us. I’m not saying this trading style is ineffective because value investing definitely has its place in the market. What I’m saying is you either adjust to the change that is happening or you remain stubborn and miss a lot of opportunity that’s swimming within your reach right now.

Seriously, from one trader to another: Invest some time and effort into what is happening right now and try to see around the corner for what’s next. I don’t think I’ve ever seen or read about this much opportunity available on a daily basis. It’s a plentiful time that surely won’t last forever so it’s important to make some moves quick. 

As the stock market becomes overextended it’s important that you don’t have all your money attached to it as well. When the eventual pullback or bear market comes you want to feel proud that you took action ahead of time to evenly disperse your hard earned cash across multiple investment avenues.",['TWTR']

I also don’t want to just toss it into an index fund as I personally believe I’ll be able to pick the best stocks from each sector (or at least the top 25% in each sector) and outperform the general market as a whole. I also enjoy doing research on companies as it lets me stay up to date on what is driving our society from the business perspective and juxtapose that to my personal perspective.

mc869g,,StockMarket,post,1616598645,"Should I invest in S&P 500 or MSCI World index fund ?Hello everyone,

based on my question, you will notice that I am new to investing. After having a few winners in 2020, I got tired of trying to pick stocks and want to move into a more defensive position: exchange traded index fund (ETFs).

I am trying to figure out if a monthly investment of $300 over the next 20+ years is better in MSCI World (60% USA, 12% Europe, 7% Japan etc.) or in S&P 500 (100% US). 

Why I am hesitating? Of course I want higher returns and historically the S&P500 has been better than the overall world market (if my research on the topic is correct). Also, USA has around 60% weight in the MSCI World and the top 10 holdings in MSCI World are also the top 10 companies in the S&P500 index (except Nestle, which is Swiss). Basically the US is the driving force here. 

Therefore I was thinking, why not invest 100% in the US instead of only 60%. I understand that this question implies another question, which is ""Do you think that the US economy and the US stock market will continue to yield high returns on the long term?"". Difficult question to answer. 

However, I'd be happy to hear your opinions or recommendations on which strategy is the best for long-term investing.

P.S. I know Michael Burry hates ETFs, because he thinks that they are, quote: ""draining brains"". People are giving up on doing their own DDs for single stocks and rely only on the overall market passively. What are your thoughts on this?","['MSCI', 'SPGI']"

Let's start saying that I agree Ocugen is a very risky play because even if the data out there already suggests that it will be a cheap and effective vaccine, covaxin is ENTIRELY depending on getting approval in the US. There are several reasons to be bullish:

1. Biden is relying heavily on technocrats. That's why he doesn't say anything public - he does backdoor deals to try to get policies through, taking the load of Manchin and other centrists. Remember, Biden was in the Senate for decades and was vice-president, that's just him.

2. The technocrats are former Obama folks. Their BIG push right now is the Quad, which is a quasi alliance designed to contain China. South Korea and Japan are the weak legs - they hate each other due to history issues. India is the absolute key to the quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy  

3. Covaxin is India's big Pharma play and they will push it with the other quad members if they want India to help balance China. 

4. India is also one of the world's biggest producers of vaccines (generics). This is important for Modi's economic development model to get his vaccines in the West. OCGN will be able to produce a lot of vaccine for cheap. The problem is PURELY a bottleneck issue, will the US give authorization? I think yes since the Biden people desperately need India in the quad and Indo (Indian Ocean) Pacific (Pacific Ocean) strategy. Those Biden/Obama folks also have a bone to pick with Trump, and are all in on the science/vaccine train. They see no problem with increasing US supply. They don't give a shit about who makes the vaccine.   

5. The US and China just had an AWFUL meeting in Alaska where China was basically talking shit for 13 minutes. US basically said, don't best against us - a threat to China.     Of course, we still need phase 3 data. Until that's out, we just got to wait. But ALL of the geopolitics point to obvious reasons why there will be approval.

mbd33s,grxwr85,StockMarket,comment,1616515168,">Discord recently hired a new chief financial officer as a first step toward a potential IPO, [the Wall Street Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chat-startup-discord-hires-its-first-finance-chief-to-boost-growth-11616086771?mod=searchresults_pos1&page=1) last week.

It sounds like some big companies (Amazon and Epic games are mentioned as potential bidders as well) are interested in capitalizing on discord's future.

I use discord and run a community and am also a subscriber for the past few years. If they go public I am definitely in. While they are firmly established as a place for people to socialize while playing video games, they've got their eye on expanding beyond the video game sphere.

I use slack for work but discord is superior as a collaborative tool. That's probably where Microsoft sees value. They can also provide discord as part of Windows. I think this can be good for both assuming Microsoft continues its trend toward becoming a more open platform than it's been in the past.

Because discord is also still firmly grounded in video game culture, there's overlap with Microsoft's Xbox and PC gaming I'm general. It's hard to imagine more value being provided by the other bidders in this situation. Still, Discord also has done very well on its own and the size of this bid suggests it would thrive even without being purchased. I'd bet that if they went public, Microsoft would buy up a lot of shares. Their futures are intertwined.","['AMZN', 'MSFT']"

mbo9jc,,StockMarket,post,1616532034,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 23, 2021 Stocks pulled back Tuesday, extending the recent bout of volatility, as market participants considered commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Moreover, a rise in COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted a new lockdown in Germany. 

Market participants closely monitored remarks from both Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.”

While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market remains volatile, with Treasury yields rising once again in anticipation of strong economic recovery and inflationary fears that could cause the Fed to reign back sooner-than-expected. We think the fear is overblown, given the Fed’s consistency in this stance. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Early today, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

I've seen more chatter and russle around the Renewable Energy sector then ever before. Energy Storage is the new hot topic of things to come in the near future.

With Renewable Energy the goal is to keep a system Sustainable, in present times the typical energy storage solution has a lithium battery storing energy to release when needed and that's the problem. Lithum Batteries simply dont last long enough, they have a limited lifespan that damages performances over charge cycles active as a 'bottleneck' to the sustainable solution, not to mention the flammable risks.
Doesn't sound very Sustainable.

This is where the next generation of Energy Storage is born. So much talk and chatter around the subject with news outlets sharing light on 'new battery devopment' or articles sharing the latest battery installation at a brand new Solar Farm, for example.

For me, after reading up on the 'next big thing' - I'd have to side with the a Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB). I recommend reading up on the subject and DYOR into how the world will chance stace from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

If you're an investor trying to put some smart money into a stock, I'd recommend reading into Bushveld Minerals #BMN - A company one of the highest amounts on Vanadium reserves in their South Africa mine with alot of side streams actively being very profitable.

The  Russell 2000 is down about 7% from its all time high on March 15th but  still up over 10% on the year to date. This is on top of the 18% return  during 2020. When measured from the March lows, it is now up 87%  compared to the 44% for the S&P 500 and 68% for the NASDAQ.

From  a macro perspective, small caps tend to lead during the beginning of a  new bull market. Based on everything I've read, most predictions are  that it will continue to outperform the broader market for the  foreseeable future and this correction is a very good buying point.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

It’s a good thing -> in the previous ruling right before this one, the DTCC now has the authority to ask participants to post more collateral for any plays that the DTCC as too risky. The participants can’t use the excuse that they haven’t reconciled to the DTCC statements because they could basically do a full months worth of risky plays and participants could have used the excuse that there are variances and will report those variances after month end (sometimes weeks after the high risk trades are done and over with).",

mcs5v4,,wallstreetbets,post,1616655481,"TIL the first market crash at the NYSE was caused by an epic short squeeze[The panic of 1901](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901) was caused by a standoff between J.P. Morgan/James Hill and E. H. Harriman for control over Northern Pacific Railways. Trying to take control of the company, both parties combined bought over 94% of the float. At the same time, other investors were heavily shorting the stock (to sell to one of the parties), until at one point everyone realized that they won't be able to cover their short position because Morgan/Hill and Harriman won't sell their shares. The shorts were squeezed as they fought for the remaining 6% of the shares and drove NP from $20 to $240. To pay for the high covering share prices, the shorts liquidated their other positions, causing mass panic that rippled through the whole stock market. Overwhelming cries of ""sell! sell! sell!"" were heard at the NYSE trading floor. Temporary relief were provided when rumors of Morgan's broker's death were spread, but quickly dissipated and the panic resumed. The whole ordeal concluded only when the two parties reached a truce and the shorts were finally able to cover their position.

Edit: [someone corrected me and NP actually went to an intraday high of $1000/share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/gs6jxro?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), corresponding to over $31K in today's dollars.

Where are we? The boonies.

Where are we going? Let me use some crayons:

&#x200B;

[Keep the $100 resistance mark in mind for later on](https://preview.redd.it/h86fai46d6p61.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8472153e2cb4914ba1fa0c5f324a3f10dc0bc8e)

The $157 handle was indeed important, but as a resistance as it turned out :(

Oh well, onwards and upwards.

[Option sentiment for gme](https://optionsentiment.live/gme) is now bearish AF:

https://preview.redd.it/reg2jugid6p61.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb5ea061c083796cc6e8da66aa2c855abbc1b2e

Huge payoff if they bring this down to $100 for this week (remember I said to remember the $100 handle?):

&#x200B;

[100p doubled to 14k from 7k on Tuesday](https://preview.redd.it/33d4aotrd6p61.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9666ac1fc4f30cb06d6f0f53453e6831a425f3e)

So what does this mean? It means we're probably seeing that $100 handle (is it early enough for those 100p to print if it it hits today? Too lazy to check out the options data).

Once that is done and profits are taken by the puts, we should be at $100 which should be more than enough appetizing for the big whales to come swinging back in, catching the bears in a nice trap and possibly making those 13k 200c print as well.

What does it all mean? Probably get in at $100 if you're still up for it, it's probably where the 'smart money' is gonna jump on-board.

Note though, if the $100 is broken hard, we're going back to $50 bois.

As always, not financial advise, I just make VR porn games.

EDIT:

Well, 11.000 of the 14.000 100p just [went the way of the dodo](https://optionsentiment.live/gme):

mcgskj,,wallstreetbets,post,1616620302,"THIS IS NOT AN INVESTMENT SUB. This is a gambling hub.I’ve noticed a lot, especially since the GameStop drama in January, a lot of people, mostly the newcomers that come to this sub, feel as if they need to tell everybody what a good investment strategy is. Well I’m here to tell you that that is not why this sub exists. 

This sub is for people that can Yolo in FDs on spy cards, this sub is for people that put their entire money enough feeling video game market and getting 200,000% and then somehow still come out losing money. This is not to say that the sub is only for people that lose money but rather this is a gambler sub in that we put a lot of trust and really a lot of retardation into our DD‘s and hope that at least one of them goes to the moon and make us a millionaire. Tomorrow is either a Lambo or a food stamps. 

So while your advice of “Jesus dude you should just buy LEAPs on Apple calls” is appreciate it is not appropriate for the sub. this is not why the sub was  created. we are not investment, I cannot stress this enough, this is not a good investments sub. if you’re only investment is for your 401(k) in a company, you should leave like right now.

You don’t get to have a profile picture of a WallStreetbets logo with diamonds in your hand and then cry every single time on every single post “oh dude you should’ve gotten the leaps call Apple that’s the good strategy”

We venerate people like keepfuckingvalues that made insane amount of money betting on an insane stock. We’ve venerate people like analfarmer that got insanely lucky and insanely dumb at the same time and made so much money and also lost so much money. We venerate people like controlthenarrative who gave us such an amazing run of his own life. These people, were not venerated because they all lost or had massive gains but because they attributed the essence of this sub in its purest form: a gambler hub. There’s nothing “investment” going on in this sup ,at least not that I know of. 

I’m not gonna soap box about “Le new people ruined old feel” but please understand that people are not buying GameStop or such securities the same way you would buy apple. It is fundamentally different. We should not try to make this sub into another investment. Wallstreet treats markets like casino. And this sub was directly made for retail investors to treat it as a casino as well.",['AAPL']

md3080,,wallstreetbets,post,1616691685,"UWMC Follow Through - The Mad Money Interview, Mortgage Servicing Rights, and Bank to Be Made Today :)So here was my initial DD. [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough\_with\_the\_techno\_mumbo\_jumbo\_a/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/)

And here was my YOLO:  [Follow Through on my UWMC DD : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcdlwg/follow_through_on_my_uwmc_dd/) 

I obviously wished to give a status update after the Jim Cramer interview yesterday night, and talk about the rapid price decline (Everything opened down), since it went to 7.73.

So, first of all. The Jim Cramer interview. I liked that the CEO

* Seemed hungry. Aggressive (in a good way). He's a competitor. He's fierce. He wants to be #1, and he wants to make money hand over fist. 
* Re-affirmed guidance even with rising interest rates and with his ultimatum(This is a material statement, so I'm not inclined to believe he's lying) My memory is slightly foggy. But I actually think he said that they were going to have even better quarters ahead. 
* He stated that out of 12,000 Brokers, not even 500, chose to partner with Quickens. This is a -bit- misleading, as only around 4000-4500 were sending business to both. Regardless, it's a wonderful figure.
* Stated that Rocket is mostly Refi's (93% is the figure he gave), whereas UWM thrives on home purchases. He's stated they do BETTER in a high interest rate scenario (especially compared to other mortgage brokers). 

Overall, there were other points, but their hazy and I will need to re-watch the interview. However, this is not just regurgitation, or I wouldn't post this. I want to talk about Mortgage Servicing Rights as an asset, which the CEO has been accumulating more and more of. 

Definition: Mortgage Servicing Rights are the rights to collect monthly payments, allocate principal and interest to each payment, manage insurance fees, and managing property tax payments. A mortgage lender may outsource the tasks to a third party in exchange for a fee (Aforementioned mortgage servicing rights). The payments must still be sent back to the original mortgage lender, of course, but without the fee negotiated. 

Hedge Against Inflation: Mortgage servicing rights represents a significant revenue source for many independent mortgage banking companies, and community banks. Given the dynamic interest rate environments, mortgage servicing rights create a natural hedge or protection on the supply side of the mortgage lending business. When interest rates rise, there are fewer prepayments, and the value  of mortgage servicing rights increases. However, when interest rates are low, the prepayment speed increases, and the value of mortgage servicing rights decrease. Ishbia had been, and is still accumulating, mortgage servicing rights. The value of which will rise as interest rates increase. This is one of many reasons why he's poised to do well in a rising rate environment, especially relative to peers. 

I do not think these mortgage servicing rights have soured, as the majority, if not almost all, of the purchases of homes recently have been by white collar buyers wo have not been affected by Covid and have seen their Net Worth increase due to the pandemic.

I'd also like to look at homebuilders, and furniture makers as KH popped. based off earnings, and yet another homebuilder did well on earnings. (Can't remember the name, as I was watching CNBC for an hour prior to Jim Cramer's interview) 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy, Buy, Buy. Strong fundamentals.

I ended up buying a tiny amount of extra shares at around 7.97. Unfortunately, I was busy on the phone at 7.73 talking about the stock, as well as determining how to move around some capital I had to take advantage of this, and didn't realize i still had 95 shares of GE lying about and i knew the market would correct on the stock quickly since the market is a rational force over a longer period of time. By the time i realized it had already went back up to 8.11 :(. Regardless, I've bought more shares. My cost basis has been lowered, and i expect when I'm approved to sell covered calls on my Merril Account, I'll purchase even more shares. Is it bad that I kind of hope it'll go back down to the 7.70's :(. 

Position: 3,067 Shares, and 17 7.5 Calls for May",['GE']

Like most of you all, I really like Apple. They're a solid company and they keep punching even when it seems like they're a commodity company with commodity products. Barring their crap native macOS apps (cough..calendar) they know what people want to buy and they make incredible margin while they're at it. 

I am overall long on the stock (both equity and options), but very bearish in the short-term. I've taken some big hits and I kept wondering why until I zoomed out. **Apple has retraced every single ATH gap up that I can remember since 2007ish.** Apple has had plenty of gap ups, but the concerning ones are gap ups that take the stock to an ATH. On July 31st, apple gapped up to new ATHs. Obviously it kept going up from there, but it never retraced the original July gap.

Back in July of 2020, [Apple announced a 4:1 stock split.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lcarrel/2020/07/31/apple-announces-4-for-1-stock-split-to-bring-in-new-investors/?sh=62ba0f2b5401) This was around the same time that TSLA did the same thing. There was a ton of market euphoria and guess what happened when apple announced its split? 95 > 108. Nearly a 15% gain in a matter of days. And the stock kept going up from there. Look at that July 31st 2021 ATH gap up. Dang.

**SHORT TERM:** 

So for anyone wondering how low apple will go, my estimate is $95.

I would expect apple to hit $100 close to the end of April - just before earnings

&#x200B;

**LONG-TERM VIEW**  
Once the gap fills, I see a steady climb back to $150.

However aapl has rejected breaking 118 so many times.  Maybe factor in the way meme stocks are behaving and that more and more funds use bots to troll and see what we are buying and talking about. I have added to my position a few times during this crazy storm and it is always at 118s. I had the same thought process some time ago. But market dynamics have changed. So we must adapt to them. I'd also consider a stock repurchase and div hike to not allow that fall off. Just an opinion.,['AAPL']

md6n8s,,wallstreetbets,post,1616701504,"market manipulationMany people are aware that almost the entire OTC Market has been crashing in unison for the past month or so.  Now we may finally know why.  On February 18 and February 22, the Market Maker (MM) JANE appeared on 36 of the highest volume stocks in the OTC.  Some examples include OZSC, AITX, GAXY, TSNPD, AABB, ENZC, INKW, OPTI, NSAV, PVDG and WDLF.  Later that number increased to 78 stocks.  February 22 is also the same day that GME and AMC began trending upward again after a dip that lasted for a couple weeks.

Have you ever noticed that many of your big OTC stocks tend to follow the exact same price curves, dips, spikes and dumps at the same time?  This manipulation from JANE is why, and based on the timeline of JANE's appearance in these high volume OTC stocks, the evidence suggests that JANE is heavily manipulating the OTC downward using tactics of naked shorting, dark pool selling and Not-Held Orders in some connection with the fight against retail in GME and AMC.

Please check for yourself by going to https://www.otcmarkets.com/otc-link/broker-dealer-directory/JANE and selecting ""Common Stock"" from the ""Type"" drop down menu to view the list of stocks that JANE is in.  View the historical charts for many of these stocks and watch them follow the same patterns downward beginning February 22nd.

Significant research has been done on this by https://twitter.com/og_tigress , u/Extlis from the Waypoint Refinery Discord and many others.  Pass the word along and up the chain so that we can stop the blatant manipulation by JANE (Jane Street Capital).",['TWTR']

Palantir isn’t Tesla.

And, that’s OK.

TLDR: They’re both innovative, potentially world-changing companies...but they couldn’t be more different...and that will drive short term stock price/market cap.

TESLA

CEO 
- Genius/rebel/hero
- Celebrity meme factory
- Fearless tweeter...420
- Bit enthusiast
- NTF fan

COMPANY - Easy to understand B to C:
- EVs, solar and batteries.

BUSINESS
- Profitability is questionable...selling carbon credits drives current profitability.
- Competitive moat is being eroded. They still lead in battery tech and production, but competition is no longer years away...many auto companies will be launching EVs by 2022.

PRODUCT
- Their cars are sexy, lust-worthy, amazing tech.
- Battery tech/production is years ahead of the competition.

BUZZ
- Legions of fans...EV owners, stonk owners, Musk/TSLA stans.

STONK MOMENTUM
- Driven by tech evangelists, retail enthusiasm and reactionary Wall St momentum traders.
- Most Wall St pros fear shorting this stonk.

THE FUTURE
Strap-in...TSLA stonk is highly volatile...it already 🚀🚀🚀...then dropped a bit...nobody knows exactly where it will go next...the next moves will likely be huge.


PALANTIR

CEO 
- A genius...but, people see the hair and think he’s an eccentric nerd.

COMPANY - Difficult to understand B to B:
- Beyond data mining? AI? Ontology? 
- You literally have to learn PLTR’s capabilities...not many people are up for that.

BUSINESS
- Overall, a very promising company. 
- Their Global TAM is 500B+ and have a clear roadmap for growth/profitability...likely a conservative estimate. 

PRODUCT
- They’ve been developing potentially world changing software for over a decade...funded and battle tested by the DOD/DARPA...this is how Arpanet was developed.
- Their competitive moat is significant...the AWS and IBM partnerships are proof.

BUZZ
- No legions of fans tho...hard to have legions of fans when most will never use this product/understand the capabilities.

STONK MOMENTUM
Totally dependent on tangible results:
- News...Partnerships/Case Studies
- Demos/Case Studies
- Quarterly Revenue/Earnings...would be great to have a blowout quarter...just to flex a bit.

THE FUTURE
PLTR will 🚀🚀🚀...but, it will take time.

PREDICTION
PLTR will have a larger market cap than TSLA within 10 years.","['IBM', 'TSLA']"
