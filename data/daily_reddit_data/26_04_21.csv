mysz54,,stocks,post,1619425918,"Reviewing the Bear Case on Paysafe (PSFE)JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, recently noted that fintechs pose ""enormous competitive threats"" to banks and SF Federal Reserve board member, Jackie Reses, sees them “taking over and revolutionizing banking” with “a wholesale transition” of “a $16 trillion market cap”.

In this context, fintech Paysafe (PSFE) is newly listed on the NYSE and introduced to the US market. Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:

&#x200B;

Common bear arguments:

\#1 Old business

\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat

\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult

\#4 No growth

\#5 Slow growth

\#6 Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.

\#7 Not profitable

\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell

\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.

&#x200B;

\#1) Old business. 

Paysafe’s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Much of Paysafe’s business is in back-end payment processing so most don’t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method” and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Paysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They’ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Aside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service. 

In preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun & Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.

As Chairman Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab…I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. 

&#x200B;

\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. 

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe’s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,“a fortress. It’s got a moat… We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise."" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion ""unbanked"" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors

From SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: “To be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“To be a winner in this space, you’re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That’s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we’ve entered.”

&#x200B;

\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. 

Synergistic inorganic growth through M&A is a key pillar of Paysafe’s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” (2, 4)

&#x200B;

\#4) No growth. 

It’s true that Paysafe’s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev

2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)

2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).

2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, “exited low value referral channels” and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

—Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

— Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.

&#x200B;

\#5) Slow growth. 

Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe’s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.

Analyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”

In the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:

1 ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

2 ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""

3 New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

4 ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""

5 ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

6 ”Delaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March""

7 ""Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%""

8 “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL""

9 “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year”

10 “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling”

11 “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting”

12 “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear”

13 “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools”

14 ""Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization""

15 “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal”

16 “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think“

&#x200B;

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

&#x200B;

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Notes:

1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.

2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.

3 As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.

4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

&#x200B;

\#6) Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more. 

Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity’s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”

Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: “Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.” Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:

Square: 77.8X

Repay : 8.7X

Fiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X

GPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X

Shift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA

Affirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA

Paysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA

Bill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA

Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe’s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they’ll be able to fund M&A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.

&#x200B;

\#7) Not profitable. 

Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, “Paysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company’s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.”

These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:

Repay: -0.67,

Affirm : -2.18,

Nuvei : -1.08,

Paysign : -0.19.

Bill : -0.62,

Shift4 : -0.43

Average EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69

If you read their transcripts and presentations, you’ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They’ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.

&#x200B;

\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. 

The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it’s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.

Importantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley’s time-tested M&A playbook.

Blackstone itself says (9), “The term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.” With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”

In a recent interview Foley said, private equity’s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the table…All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.”

The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand his both his M&A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the “The Foley Network” (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity’s massive transactional volume). In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, “The thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it’s a great asset.”

But, let's assume these funds do eventually sell a portion of their shares which, given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square’s, but more profitable), would allow index funds to accumulate larger positions. Just as large funds often drive price down to accumulate shares, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and do so via off-market trades, avoiding price slippage. This question is less about real risk than it is about short-term fear, which is ultimately why understanding the context and fundamentals is so critical.

&#x200B;

\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. 

According to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.

Importantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.

Total FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 % 

Blackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 % 

CVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 % 

Other Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 % 

Cannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 % 

PIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 % 

723,734,536 100.0 % 

Below are some examples of the warrant cashless conversion rates per the chart in the S1 (7). Cash redemption is more profitable when commons trade above $18. 

$18 : $6.50

$17 : $6.08 

$16 : $5.57

$15 : $5.05

$14 : $4.54

$13 : $4.04 

&#x200B;

Despite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements without prior notice, to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of “fake sell walls” and HFS “short ladder attacks” as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. 

I think Paysafe is undervalued and, very likely, a 3X from here. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for “sticky” customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds are poised to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.

&#x200B;

Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe’s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:

$360 million revenue

$220 million gross profit

$105 million EBITDA

Apparently in 2016 the state I live in (Virginia) sold the stock as there are some laws that say(I'm terribly paraphrasing as I don't understand this at all) if nothing was done with the stock and it was deemed inactive, ownership of the stock is given to the state of the last known residence of the original owner.  We called the state office and they told us to fill out a bunch of paperwork and submit it to the state to see what can be done about recouping some of the funds from the sale.

myo8zn,gvw3we0,stocks,comment,1619407810,"Love this question as that's essentially all that investing is about. To me the price movement each day should not have an effect on your decision to add/subtract to your position unless the movement itself is a symptom of a newly revealed issues with the company.

Presumably once you have decided that a company is undervalued, you want to build a position that you are comfortable with and stop. Some people think that technical analysis can be helpful to find an entry point (I don't subscribe to tech analysis, but to each his own). I myself will build a position immediately if I truly think that a company is undervalued at market price. This is because if the company is truly undervalued, it's statically likely that every passing day gives it a chance to ""revert to the means."" And this seems true btw, for every undervalued stocks I bought, it took about 2-3 quarters or less for the stock to show outsized gains compared to the index. Remember that your time dedicated to do DD about a company is also valuable. Why waste that value on the hope that the stock would fall even further?

So, if the price drops, you want to find out why. Does anything change with the company that affects your DD. If so, maybe the new lower price is justified. If the price goes up, does it have to do with good news that were not part of your original DD. If so, maybe the new higher price is justified. If it's purely market fluctuation or news that is immaterial to company's bottom line (see Intel's ""scandal"" about using weak password), I will ignore.",['INTC']

I can picture a lot of European cities for instance moving forward with more regulation on Airbnb rentals (or other providers). Berlin had a ban on AirBnB few years ago, that has since been overturned but now Berlin has some of the stricter regulations applied to AirBnB. Other cities to watch include places like Porto, Prague, Amsterdam and Barcelona in my opinion.",

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**

I bought PLTR to be the cornerstone of my long term portfolio (about 50% total) and intended to hold it indefinitely. Over the last few months I have begun to feel that they are perhaps already overvalued and I would be better off in a stock that is more well known and more widely understood. 

With their earnings report due in mid May how close to the actual release should I get before I sell? I'm guessing the small gains it is making daily right now are investors 'pricing in' the news already. 

I do have a number in mind and if it hits I will sell regardless, but to be honest I would be happy to get out at my break even point and would rather see a smaller gain then end up waiting a week too long and end up holding on for another quarter, or until they hopefully release some ground breaking news. 

TL:DR -- If you were going to sell a stock based on the hype surrounding its upcoming earnings report would you get out the day before? A few days? A week? Now? 

Thanks in advance.",

Don't make the long hold in your portfolio something that you can change your mind on in a few months. Your long hold should be something that bad news and short-term price changes won't impact.",

And unlike most of them, it has real, genuine potential to become a force. You sell PLTR for something in the mid 20s and you will spend the rest of your life regretting it imo.

If you have a number in mind put the limit order out now, GTC, at that number.  watch the price action.  you can always modify the order if you think you can get more out of something.

In my life, once I made the decision to sell a stock, 7 times out of 10 I should have just sold it and not tried to eke more out of it.  Especially if I had something else to put the money into that I thought would do better.  In a few cases I got a little more after I was mentally ready to sell by delaying but more often I was disappointed.

Humans tend to undervalue the ecstasy of gains and overvalue the pain of taking losses, especially if you let your gains turn into losses.  But losses are good for tax purposes, so we just need to evolve discipline into what we do offsetting other gains with losses isn't a bad thing and nobody has 100% winning trades.

I know variance is the risk of a stock / portfolio but what is standard deviation supposed to represent? Cause if it is just the square root of variance then why should I even calculate it if I can just worry about lowering my variance? Thanks, also sorry if the question is confusing to read, I’m not sure how else to word it.",
mz30vz,gvyeoef,stocks,comment,1619459776,"I’ve helped teach statistics at the graduate level and have tutored college students professionally. Your question is more or less how to detangle variance and standard deviation.

I’ll keep this simple. I’m cutting corners on showing all the math. 

Imagine if you had a small array of 5 numbers. The mean of this array was calculated as X (the exact number doesn’t matter in this example). 
Let’s determine how far away from the mean each of the 5 numbers in your array are: -3, -1, 0, +1, +3 (pulling this out of the air for example’s sake). In other words, one of your five numbers is 3 integers below the mean. Another is 1 under. Another is exactly equal to the mean. Another is 1 above. The last is 3 above. If you had to sum the total difference each number in the array was from the mean, you would get zero. Try adding -3, -1, 0, +1, and +3. But how do you show there were difference between each number and the mean? Well...you can square these differences.

So with the example, we can square -3 to get +9. square -1 to get +1. Etc.
If you square the differences between each number in the array from the mean   and add them together (sum of squares), you found the variance. Variance works because numbers squared are always positive. But this number is much larger than what we were dealing with (Again, look at a difference of -3 becoming +9). The variance can be reduced by taking the square root. This is why Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance. This is why we use SD because it sort of recalibrated the scale and numbers used.

This has applications in stocks for stuff like price and volatility.",
mz30vz,gvyc4g1,stocks,comment,1619458697,"> The calculation of variance uses squares because it weighs outliers more heavily than data closer to the mean. This calculation also prevents differences above the mean from canceling out those below, which would result in a variance of zero.

> Because of this squaring, the variance is no longer in the same unit of measurement as the original data. Taking the root of the variance means the standard deviation is restored to the original unit of measure and therefore much easier to interpret.",
mz30vz,gvycfbh,stocks,comment,1619458825,"Same thing, different units. Variance is average deviations from the mean of all data points. Standard deviation is the square root of variance (like you said)... the measure of dispersion... so if the standard deviation of a set of observations is 10... that means that 68% of the observations in that group are within 10 of the mean (+10/-10).  


I think its just a preference - if you're a finance major you're learning about modern portfolio theory and they quote variance instead of std dev",
mz30vz,gvyeqg7,stocks,comment,1619459800,"Standard deviation measures the average distance from each data point to the mean. So if you have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10 that means that on average each data point is 10 away from 100. 

The variance is what you get before you square root to get the standard deviation. So it's the average squared distance from the mean. Since it's the average of square distances it can be highly impacted by outliers because squaring big numbers makes very big numbers.",
mz30vz,gvyfts5,stocks,comment,1619460267,"STDEV is the average distance from the mean.

Variance is STDEV squared.

The reason Variance is squared is to remove the +/- from the equation, because if we just add the individual differences from the mean we'd get 0.

Personally I don't know how this relates to stocks I'm just YOLOing heavily shorted stocks that got fucked up in the pandemic.",

mz2i0x,,stocks,post,1619456766,"Great Regenerative Medicine Earnings Play/Investment Opportunity! Mimedx (MDXG)My largest holding reports earnings this week with a conference call Thursday morning before Market open. Mimedx has developed Best in Class advanced wound care products from dehydrated human amnion chorion membrane (dHACM) derived from donated placental tissue. With respect to Advanced wound care applications, these products are used to care for difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers/venous foot ulcers, and for the repair of surgical and other hard to heal wounds (including amputations, dental extractions, and for healing burns without or with only minimal scarring). Reimbursement for Mimedx advanced wound care products was recently approved by the nation's  largest commercial  payor, United Health.

Mimedx is a turnaround play, with an entirely new Board and Management and their Advanced wound care products with 85% gross margins are alone worth the price of admission. But the real potential gamechanger for this company is its micronized injectable products for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.  Phase IIb trial for knee osteoarthritis and Phase III trial for plantar fasciitis are underway with data expected soon. All indications are that the data will show meaningful efficacy with no adverse risks. Other potential indications include shoulders, elbows, hips, etc. Medically, this is an area of great unmet need and Mimedx's Amniofix Injectable product has been given Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation status by the FDA wifh the potential to speed up the approval process. The potential market for these products, if approved, is in the billions annually. 

Again, 1st quarter earnings and conference call for any updates on the injectable product approval process is on Thursday. Mimedx is currently trading just above its 50 day moving average of $10.43 and today's pullback may be a great opportunity for a trade or long-term investment entry point, with a stop limit set below the 50 day moving average (give it a little room or you may be stopped out early).

Shares will be issued within the 15-day period immediately following the record date of the Fund's May 2021 monthly distribution to stockholders.

The German world-wide wholesale retailer Metro AG: $MTTWF (or $B4B in Germany) is overlooked in my opinion.

$MTTWF was originally founded in 1964 and has grown to operate across 26 countries. It was spun-off from $MTTRY in 2017 and the share price has been falling ever since.

$MTTWF shows stable revenue from wholesale (2017 - 2018 dip was because they stopped reporting the hypermarket department revenue, sold in 2020). The wholesaler is leading the pack in multiple countries, and is growing in other countries.

It’s been trading side-ways with 5 - 6 P/E lately so I’ve done some comparison between $MTTWF and $WMT. $WMT is financially doing 20x better than $MTTWF (possibly due to business model diversity + dominating the US market). However, the market cap of $WMT is almost 100x that of $MTTWF

Assuming $WMT is trading at fair value today, doesn’t this entail that $MTTWF is massively undervalued (20% - 30% of fair value)?

Position: I own 572 shares of METRO AG as of today, and got some spare cash incase of a dip

mz0vbf,gvygold,stocks,comment,1619460631,So ETFs are fluid and trade throughout the day so there is no premium at the end of the day.  The price of the ETF changes based on the supply demand of the ETF which should theoretically be reflective of the price of the underlying assets (NAV).  If the price strays too far from the NAV there are authorized participants that can create or destroy shares of the ETF by buying or selling shares of the underlying assets in your example bitcorn (which I am assuming is some electronic produce).  So if the ETF is trading higher than the NAV one of the authorized participants can buy the underlying assets and create a new share of the ETF and then sell it to the buyers for a profit instead of selling existing shares (this keeps the price from getting too far above the NAV).  If the price is lower than the NAV they could then sell the underlying asset and destroy shares of the ETF.  This way the outstanding shares of an ETF is not static but the price should stay close to the NAV.,

&nbsp;

The [items of business](https://i.imgur.com/5wxsOvY.png) for the meeting include an approval from stakeholders to allow the company to **increase the number of authorized shares of common stocks**. This is what is called a [share dilution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp). 

Going further through the proxy statement document, we have the details for Proposal 4 — Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock **from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares** https://i.imgur.com/6Myo5r7.png

&nbsp;

>Description of the Proposed Amendment
Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to **increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the
proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock
for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for
adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.**

...

>If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the
date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

...

>As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed
Amendment **would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for**
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, *expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,
including shares we would be obligated to issue* **in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited**; stock
dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional
capital. Such issuances would occur **without further action or approval of our stockholders** and would be subject to and
limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations.

...

>Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the
potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.

...

>**The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval** of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.

Both consolidate the prices from different, smaller exchanges as well. They both use UDP multicast and very similar binary protocols. These are the ultimate source of equities market data and for either you will need to pay (a lot of) money. The equivalent for equity options is called OPRA and is also a provided with a binary protocol over UDP multicast for a large fee. Futures exchanges like CME and ICE have their own protocols.

Some companies pay to receive this data directly and either write their own programs to process it, hire someone (like me) to do it for them, or buy an off-the-shelf program to do it. You need to do this if you want to be anywhere near the market in terms of latency, which is important for automated trading and market making (where you are required to be within a certain % of the price at all times).

There are also a lot of companies which take the CTA and UTP and OPRA data and others and provide it to others. Bloomberg are a big one - they provide both terminals and UIs for traders and also their own market data feeds in their own format (that is they take lots of disparate market data feeds and normalise them into one format). And there are others.

Websites or trading apps are most likely to pay a third party for market data who does all the backend work and gives them a single consolidated feed with the data they want in a simple format.","['ICE', 'NDAQ', 'CME']"

Sailing all over the planet was too risky for any company during that time. Ships were lost, fortunes were squandered, and financiers realized they had to do something to mitigate all that risk.
* Early stock trading happened at **Coffee shops,** and stocks were hand written in paper and inventors had to trade their stocks with other investors in coffee shops.
* It was tough to make out legit companies to illegitimate companies back in the day, and in many cases companies were able to make tons of money before a single ship was ever set for sail. And because of that a bubble was burst and the government of England banned the issuing of shares until 1825.
* And despite ban of issuing shares, **London Stock Exchange** was established in 1801, it was very limited exchange because of the ban of issuing shares.
* And in 1817, **New York stock exchange** was established and it started trading since its very first day.
* And today, almost every single country has a stock market.  Every day, trillions of dollars are traded on stock markets.

myi7i5,,stocks,post,1619386445,"Selling Covered Calls on Indexes to Beat the MarketThere are numerous studies showing that in the long run, almost nobody beats the market, so investing in various index funds is generally the best strategy.

Wouldn't selling far OTM covered calls on index funds make it reasonably probable to beat the market in most years?

Granted, far OTM CCs provide a small premium, but it is still technically beating the market as long as you don't lose your shares. Even if you do, there is a good chance that the price dips back below the breakeven point at some point, especially if you time CCs with unsustainable spikes.

For example, many indexes had a several week run recently that had at annualized return of over 100%. There is clearly no way that rate is sustainable, so selling CCs on a run like that seems like an attractive strategy. 

I realize the percentage return might be small, but once a position gets large enough (likely if you have most of your portfolio in index funds), this strategy can either provide some extra income or can be used as a DRIP to increase shares every month, week, etc.

Now, there certainly are some risks to consider.  If you do lose your shares, you might have to pay short-term capital gains. However, you could always just close or roll the CCs. While this would be a loss, that might be attractive to offset any large short-terms gains you might already have. For example, I had huge gains in January and February. If my index CCs end up ITM, I can close them to offset short-term gains, while still holding my shares for long-term gains.

The other risk of CCs is that you generally have to be willing to hold the shares until expiration, which doesn't matter for index funds since they are generally held long.

Is there anything I'm overlooking? I don't hear much about this strategy. Normally the advice is ""don't sell CCs on shares you don't want to lose,"" which is good advice, but seems overly restrictive.

TL;DR

Selling low-delta CCs on index funds seems like a great way to slightly beat the market. Are there any non-obvious risks with this strategy?",

my7371,,stocks,post,1619352771,"VTI vs VOO - they are almost the same.I have seen several posts about these two indices and people often say that VTI is a better bet because it is so much more diversified. Well... yes and no. 

VOO has around 500 companies and tracks S&P 500 index. 

VTI has around 3,500 companies and tracks CRSP US Total Market index. 

So yes, 3,500 companies vs 500 is more diversified. However both these indices are market weighted. Which means that the larger the company the more allocation it has in the index. Because of that, and because how giant S&P 500 companies are in comparison to the other 3,000 smaller companies, 95% of VTI is S&P 500. So 95% of VTI is VOO.  Check out their historical performance - very close. I wish I could paste a graph here. 

So their performance is almost identical. VOO has a slightly higher dividend yield. Fee is the same - 3bps. 

Funny thing is that although VTI is more diversified, it has slightly higher historical volatility.

At the end - either fund is fine. However if you truly want to have non-S&P exposure, you should add VXF (or maybe VO) as a complement to VOO. 

Also, VTI is total US market. No international exposure. So VXUS might be a good companion as well if you want some outside of US exposure.",['SPGI']

my7371,gvtyv6i,stocks,comment,1619368410,"I'm going to disagree here and say that VTI is actually a lot better than VOO, and also that any total market fund is better than the S&P500. A couple of important reasons: factor investing and front running. TLDR, but VTI, buy some VXF, get rid of VOO.

First, factor investing, Small caps over time perform better than large caps because of their higher risk premium and the company's size and maturity. Since VTI has small cap exposure, there is should be slightly higher risk, but also higher returns. In recent years, the performance of VOO has outpaced VTI because small caps have actually underperformed due to the rise of large cap tech, but this is not the case historically or from a risk premium standpoint. You can see this if you include periods of small cap outperformance for example between 2003 and 2007. If you include this period, SPY went up 391% and VTI went up 449%, excluding dividends.

Second, front running. Some people might not know that the S&P500 does not actually hold the 500 largest companies in the US. VTI and total market indices actually hold many companies that have larger market cap than many of the s&P500 companies. For example Square (SQ), a favorite around here, has a market cap of 112 billion, or around the market cap of Intuit (INTU), the 76th largest companies in the S&P500. The reason for this is that the S&P500 index itself is not exactly passive but have requirements of market cap, longevity, profitability and quality as well. Why is this important? because since the index changes continuously, you would know when a company will be included or excluded. Since so much money is invested in the S&P500, you would also know that when some company has been included, there would be a ton of forced buying from those passive index funds. And if you know that there will be a lot of buying of the stock on a certain date, investors can and will front run this buying by increasing the stock price and pulling out after the passive indexers have been forced to buy in. The perfect example here is Tesla. It was not in the S&P500 despite having a huge market cap because of profitability concerns. When it was announced that Tesla would be included, the price shot up quickly in January, leading passive S&P500 index investors to not only miss out on this performance but overpay when front runners have finished buying. You can see this in VXF, which holds stocks that are NOT in the S&P500, so Tesla was in VXF but not anymore, and SQ is in VXF. During the same period from 2003, VXF went up 660%, excluding dividends, way better than both VTI and VOO, due to both size factor and lack of front running drag.

Edit: I would like to mention though that despite the outperformance of VXF over many years, I would still be careful going all in because small caps tend to have long periods of consolidation and larger corrections with periods of massive booms. After the recent small cap outperformance, I would be careful not to chase performance.","['SPGI', 'TSLA', 'INTU']"

mz1tdy,,stocks,post,1619454977,"Why Your Looking at The Wrong Numbers When Referencing S&P500 Yearly Gains.To summarize since most people won't read this whole thing:

**Most investment firms, news and posts are using a number to calculate S&P500 yearly gains that does not accurately represent whether the S&P500 had a good year or not. This number is only useful for headlines and an incredibly minute number of people. It appears great on paper but this number is then re-posted all around the net spreading bad faith statistics.**


#####**The Problem**

Alright now into the explanation. Most blogs/news/posts reference the yearly difference from the first day of the year to the last day of the year and put it in their headlines. For example, here is [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/here-are-the-top-performing-stocks-in-the-sp-500-for-2020.html) and [USAToday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/12/31/dow-jones-stocks-were-flat-early-trading-after-year-sharp-swings/4099199001/) claiming the gains for the s&p500 in 2020 was 16.23-16.3%. This makes sense at a surface statistic but once you put it into real situations you realize why it's an almost useless figure. The overwhelming majority of investors ARE NOT buying on the first day of the year and cashing out on the last day. This means the figure being tossed around in the headlines is essentially ignoring the other ~252 trading days of that year. 



[Figure 1 & 2](https://imgur.com/a/cNv8OZS) display two theoretical movements in 2020 with the same starting price and ending price. The media would be reporting the same headline figure of 'S&P500 has 16% growth in 2020'. You can see how this headline year to date figure ignores the actual health and movement of the S&P500. Especially if the final few days in 2020 are a spike like [this]( https://imgur.com/a/VyVJ5EX) theoretical graph.



Since the timing of the average person’s trades are nowhere near this, the publicized statistics on whether the S&P500 had a good year or not does not actually reflect if it had a good year or not. If you held the S&P500 for exactly a year but the sell date was any different your gains are going to be completely different. 



#####**Exploring More**



The one thing all these news organizations highlight is the concept of a year gap between the end date and starting date (253 trading days is what I'm considering a year). This is a really ignored concept that should be explored more. If you have the end date on any other day in 2020 and minus 253 trading days, you are probably going to see a large difference. Let’s look at four examples in [this graph.]( https://imgur.com/a/y2UevmW)


•	Holding from Jan 3, 2019 - Jan 6, 2020 (253 Trading Day Difference) = +32.53% 

•	Mar 21, 2019 – Mar 23, 2020 = -21.7%

•	Oct 30, 2019 – Oct 30, 2020 = +7.37%

•	Dec 4, 2019 – Dec 4, 2020 = +18.75%



Since the common denominator is this exact yearlong hold we should be extending this to calculate averages for the entire year as a whole instead of one single instance out of ~253 possible instances.


#####**The Solution**


So [figure 4]( https://imgur.com/a/y2UevmW) demonstrates 4 examples of holding for exactly a year and selling in 2020. To calculate an average, you need to find all ~253 examples. If you do this, you get a calculation which is best represented by the phrase ‘Average S&P500 Returns In 2020 After Holding For A Year’. It’s a mouthful but a much more accurate representation to the health and movement of the S&P500 on a comparison to a year ago (another phrase is ""Average S&P500 Yearly Gains in 2020""). 



[Here](https://imgur.com/a/uPlsMdu) is a distribution of all of those 253 examples. I’ve taken the liberty to skim off the bottom (lowest) 12 instances and top (highest) 12 instances (roughly 9.5%) to get rid of any massive single day outliers. This doesn’t affect the calculations that much but paints a more accurate picture. The average for 2020 is +10.97% (without the skim it’s 10.58%). You can see in Figure 5 that there is a lot of instances in the 14.6%-16.6% range but in total 71.6% of instances have an increase less than 16.2%. **That’s quite a large chance to be lower than the number being paraded.** I also did the math since 2016.




•	[2016]( https://imgur.com/a/igkjbbb) average of +1.65%

•	[2017]( https://imgur.com/a/1Mt2P4d) average of +16.97%

•	[2018]( https://imgur.com/a/dPSR4j3) average of +12.92%

•	[2019]( https://imgur.com/a/VvVvZbc) average of +5.78%

•	Combining the years [2016-2020]( https://imgur.com/a/HnDCBW3) with a skim of 50 on each end has an average of 9.74%



Let’s compare these to [Yearly S&P500]( https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns) change since 2016


Year | Published Numbers| My Calculations
:-- |:--|:--
2016 | 9.54% | 1.65%
2017 | 19.42% | 16.97%
2018 | -6.24% | 12.92%
2019 | 28.88% | 5.78%
2020 | 16.26% | 10.97%



What I find most interesting is that the published numbers almost always completely miss what’s actually happening in that year (2017 being sort of close). In 2018 if you don’t skim any numbers there is only 8 days out of 251 trading days that had -6.24% or less. **To put that into perspective the entire year is being summarized by something that only happened 3.2% of the time.** Make it make sense.




#####**TL;DR/Summary**


The media and investment firms are using the ‘Year to Date’ to interpret whether the S&P500 had a good year or not. This figure is then spread like wildfire on the internet as the god send statistic. While it is a real statistic it is being used in incredibly bad faith and does not actually represent whether the S&P500 had a good year or not. For example [this]( https://imgur.com/a/cNv8OZS) displays two theoretical movements in 2020 with the same starting price and ending price. Both would be paraded as being good years because of the 16% increase. This one instance of a yearlong gap makes up just 1 out of ~253 instances of the year. To calculate a more accurate statistic you need to average every year long gap for all trading days that year. In 2020 this equals 10.97% not the paraded 16.26%. The most notable difference is the published S&P500 YTD 2018 example above.

One could take the opening price instead, but I chose the closing price. An extremely important concept is holding for exactly 253 trading days, that's what my math takes into account. Not a single day more or less. So if you hold for 255 days the percentages will be different.

Currently, 11% of my pre-tax income goes into said 401(k) with a 5% match from my employer, 3% of my post-tax goes into an employee stock purchase program, and an additional $50 from each paycheck goes automatically into my individual investment account. Also through my employer I get granted stock yearly (usually about $700 dollars), but since that has to vest for a year before it’s mine, I don’t really count it for anything. 

In total, I have about $2k in my individual account and $4k in my 401(k)... not a lot, but it’s more than nothing.

I assume you’re getting the full match by contributing 11% of salary pre-tax. I’d look to fund a Roth IRA before looking to contribute more to the 401k. 

Investments in those accounts are ideally going to continue to be in broad market index funds, covering both US and ex-US markets. 

Only if you took full advantage of the Roth would I look to contribute to a taxable account. I’m a big proponent of keeping things simple and maintaining the ETFs you’re buying in other accounts. This makes it easier to consider a total portfolio (all accounts) approach when allocating investments and asset classes. 

Otherwise, I always recommend to scratch the speculation itch if you have it but allocate a reasonable percentage to buying individual stocks and more speculative assets.

myjj1t,gvvc60r,stocks,comment,1619392145,"I’d argue that inflation doesn’t really hurt the stock market and you shouldn’t change your strategy because of it. Inflation causes people to get out of the bond market, since the money in a 10 year bond won’t be worth as much if inflation is high. Because of this, inflation affects the bond market more than the stock market. 

Inflation is a reason that people get INTO investing. If your money loses 2% in value every year by sitting in a bank account (inflation), you’re gonna want to invest so that your money maintains or exceeds its value over time. Inflation could be seen as more of an incentive to get into the stock market, not less.

I think growth stocks could move anyway since people don’t understand that their stocks should be fine. Not many young investors know/understand this, so (if your worried about that happening) it might be good to get out of young people investments like growth stocks and get into old people investments like Mcdonalds or Coca-Cola if you don’t want THEIR ignorance to hurt YOUR portfolio. 

As for the capital gains tax, that will affect all areas of investing and i don’t think there’d be a sure way to completely avoid it. I suppose less risky stocks (like the ones you mentioned) would minimize the losses though. The big question to ask yourself is “do i think the capital gains tax is actually going to be increased? Should i decrease my risk?”

And the answer to those questions are for you to decide, not some random person you’ve never met on the internet.

my9070,,stocks,post,1619359670,"CTRE (CareTrust) REITI’m long on this position. Currently have ~100 shares. I’m here to tell you why. 

This is a healthcare REIT, I work in healthcare but am not associated with this type of care. 

~75% of their portfolio is involved with skilled nursing facilities. The rest is mostly senior housing. With the aging population this is a great play. They currently own 238 properties in the US. 

FFO growth CAGR: 1 yr 3.1%, 3 yr 16.1%, 5 yr 21.2%. This reflects good income growth over the long term. 

FFO/Share CAGR: 1 yr 1.5%, 3 yr 4.5%, 5 yr 5.9%.  Both of these growth rates are ahead of their peers and indicate the company has good growth towards the future. This is to be expected with the aging population; more people become old and need more help = more customers. 

Price/ffo is a little high compared to the average: 17.67x vs 5 yr avg 14.84x. 

Debt/asset is safe: 36.3%
Debt/ebitda: 3.4x
Maturity of debt is in 3-5 years so they have time to grow more with what they have. 

Dividend of 1$/yr. 
dividend growth: 1 yr 11.1%, 3 yr 10.6%, 5 yr 10.1%. 
Dividend growth is steady and occurs y/y. 
Payout ratio is 72.5% which is good in REITs. 

Overall this is one of my higher convictions and I add every month to it. I believe in it more than most equities out there. They have a strong leadership group and are growing at a good rate without taking on too much debt. This is a stock you buy and retire with. Cheers. 

I got my info from alreits.com. Thanks.",

my9070,gvvaaj5,stocks,comment,1619391136,"Thanks for the DD! I started really digging into healthcare REITs because of this post, so thanks for making me rich in the future! There's a lot of old people getting older out there (source: [https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/65-older-population-grows.html](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020/65-older-population-grows.html)). When you compare the number of people in the Baby Boomer generation versus the generation before it (the silent generation), there's 3.4x the number of people (71.6M vs 20.9M), so I think looking for 3.4x the number of facilities in the US in the next couple of decades is a reasonable expectation. This sector should explode. 

I have 2 questions, on this, though. And I'm new to doing my own DD so I already know I'm an idiot if the below questions have obvious answers:

I think you're right that the price/FFO is considerably lower than some of the other healthcare REITs out there (like VTR, WELL, PEAK) which all have price/FFO nearly 10x what CTRE has. Is the case for CTRE compared to VTR/WELL/PEAK just because it's a smaller company with more room to grow faster?

Also, you say the debt/asset ratio is safe, but is having the lowest debt/asset ratios in something like a REIT a good thing? Wouldn't you want their debt to asset ratio higher because that means more of your money as a share holder is actually going into physical property? Obviously there's some cutoff that's too risky, but all the competition seems to be in the 50% range for debt/assets.",['VTR']

Which investment banks and analysts have you found to be most accurate? Are there any investment banks that you absolutely don’t trust and see their upgrades as red flags? Do you follow any analysts individually? Thank you.",
myhioz,gvuzqkx,stocks,comment,1619385850,"People who say “don’t trust Wall Street analysts” aren’t thinking about it in the right way. Regardless of whether you think they’re smart or not it’s still important to understand what they think because their research is so widely distributed and trusted. I ALWAYS recommend you do you own work and verify what they say - they’re less likely to be negative on a company because they have relationships with management ....unless they have very strong conviction. So with that I’ll say this...

1. It depends on the stock you are looking at - some banks have better health care analysts and other banks have better TMT teams. Really do your research about an analysts track records. Did they work in the industry? Have they broken out from the group in their predictions? What is their track record? 

2. Analysts that cover stocks where THEIR bank was the book runner on an IPO tend to be a bit bias - so look that up and be careful there.

3. Analysts who are negative on companies are more trust worthy (unless they have a known beef with management) because they ruin their chances at corporate access for the bank (roadshows, conferences, etc) if they constantly trash a company. Management will stop talking to them or wasting their time at their events.

4. The group think among fundamental equity research analysts on Wall Street is problematic, but it could pose an opportunity for you. If every analyst for a given stock is talking about issues X, Y and Z, but you think that issue A and B are being overlooked, there are likely a lot of people out there overlooking those issues, So they’re worth spending more time on!! 

5. Reading analyst research can be a really good shortcut for getting the sense of a company before you dig into deeper research. It can highlight trends and issues that might take you a while to find on your own if they’re not heavily reported. 

TL;DR - I wouldn’t base your investment decisions solely on sell-side research, but understanding what they’re saying and what they care about can but a super helpful tool for your process!",

my003t,,stocks,post,1619321921,"Why Analyst Sees AirTags As A $10B Opportunity For Apple""Apple unveiled its Bluetooth trackers dubbed “AirTags” on Tuesday at its “Spring Loaded” virtual event. The product represents a $10 billion opportunity for Apple, according to Raymond James & Associates.

The Apple Analyst: Raymond James analyst Chris Caso has an Outperform 2 rating on the Cupertino, California-based tech giant with a price target of $160.

The Apple Thesis: Caso said that AirTags are akin to AirPods in terms of potential growth for the Tim Cook-led company as they would strengthen its ecosystem and encourage upgrades.

“We believe this product category will have very broad appeal (who wouldn't pay $30 to not lose your wallet?), and as such could grow to become a $10 billion opportunity,” wrote Caso in a note Tuesday.

In Raymond James' estimate, AirPods sell with an annual volume of nearly 70-80 million units.

“At $30 per Air Tag (or $99 for 4), if Air Tags were to sell at a similar unit volume as AirPods, that would put annual AirTag revenue at $2 – 2.5 billion,” as per Caso.

The analyst theorized that it is reasonable that AirTags would sell at a much higher unit volume compared to AirPods as users buy multiple units to tag items such as wallets and keys.

“We wouldn’t be surprised to see AirTags grow to be a $10 billion business over time, putting that product close to AirPods in terms of revenue impact.”

Precision AirTag tracking is only available for users of iPhone 11 and above and provides an incentive for users to upgrade, according to Caso.

This month, Apple said it would let third-party companies use its “Find My” tracking network, which means third-party products can now be tracked using devices made by the Tim Cook-led company.

myevk3,gvuk1ff,stocks,comment,1619378301,"It was volatile during the pandemic because they sell COVID tests, and the market was trying to price that out while QDEL was making money hand-over-fist. That revenue stream is already dying, and it'll go back to a normal growth trend once it corrects fully.  I doubt it's going back to 300 anytime soon.",
myevk3,gvuo6ai,stocks,comment,1619380283,"I’ve been looking into QDEL intently and hope to soon make a full post on my findings.

That being said, what I can say now is that for most of the past 15 years Quidel as a company seemed a bit *meh* when it came to revenue and EPS growth. Looking at a price chart (I use macrotrends.net) we see the stock rangebound for a decade until it first broke out in early 2018. This was no accident; Quidel was finally able to generate impressive YoY revenue growth *and* began to turn a profit because.....the 2017-18 flu season in the U.S. was one of the gnarliest in recent memory.

It’s important as a beginning investor to know what is driving the revenue of the company you’re investing in...for Quidel, it was first the manufacturing of flu tests, and starting last year they were among the first to branch into producing COVID tests en masse. They generated great revenue and profits off of their COVID tests last year, truly unprecedented numbers in their history, and the stock price soared off of these figures. What were the three words most uttered last year if they weren’t “testing, testing, testing”? So while taking a backseat to say, Zoom Video in terms of popularity among investors, nevertheless a robust testing apparatus was as important to the pandemic response as robust remote communications was.

What’s happening with the share price now is twofold...I believe investors are first looking to sell off the companies that most benefitted during the pandemic...think a company like Peloton too along with Zoom and Quidel. The second aspect of QDEL’s decline is that, because of the masking and social distancing protocols we all adhered to this past flu season, well, we didn’t really have a flu season did we? As a result, Quidel had to come out and say their revenue figures would be less than expected because a big moneymaker for them—flu tests—went unneeded this past year. Pair that with the mass rollout of COVID vaccinations, and we could see a *much reduced need* for both COVID and flu tests in the next 12 months. 

While valuations on QDEL are too good to be true at the moment (like P/E of 6 and a P/S of 3, for instance), I would say that it’s important for the stock to have a couple weeks of no further downtrends before deciding to jump in. I personally don’t think flu and COVID tests will be done away with entirely. In fact I think we’ve become a lot more health-conscious over the past 12 months, and more people in the future will look to test for all sorts of infectious diseases before deciding to go to work/school when feeling ill.

TL;DR: Investing in QDEL is basically a decision on whether you think cold/flu/COVID testing will play a big part in our lives in the future. While valuations at the moment are too good to be true, I’d steer clear from investing in the stock until we see some price stability...don’t want to be catching a falling knife!",

I finally got my act together and started investing in late January to build a solid nest egg for retirement. I’m 34. Half of my IRA is in Vanguard ETFs (predominantly VOO), but as I was new to investing, I supplemented VOO shares with VTV (value ETF) and VYM (dividend ETF) for additional diversification.

Is this necessary, or am I better suited to just convert these shares in the more sector-specific ETFs into more VOO? I’ve also considered VTI, but I like the dividend in VOO since the other half of my IRA is in mostly individual growth stocks that don’t yet pay one.

myfrus,gvuoi3g,stocks,comment,1619380437,"As far as VOO or VOO + VTV + VYM I'd say because of your age, the investing zeitgeist dictates you ought to be aggressive and so it would probably suggest you to just stay in VOO and funds like that, perhaps with diversification in emerging markets or well-established international markets following a similar structure as VOO. VTI is also a fine option versus VOO---higher dividend, slightly lower long-term capital gain, but similar downside exposure. VTV and VYM are probably slightly more conservative, but they're still far riskier in the retirement picture versus like bonds/cash and still subject to lose just as much if not more than VOO in a serious market downturn. 

I dunno; I'd probably just slowly DCA mostly into VOO, partly into VTI (maybe), and look into perhaps getting exposure to stable markets outside the US. My retirement is like 75% funds like these and the rest are an assortment of foreign growth, value, and a teeny tiny portion of bonds.",
myfrus,gvwg96m,stocks,comment,1619416557,"Totally up to you but you should understand that the more involved you are, the more research you will need to do. IF you have no time for that, stay in general stuff like what you have now.

If you want to make much more than market then you need to invest time to do that and at that point you want individual stocks. Funds have fundamental issues, such as holding bad companies due to being in a certain index.

Funds usually follow rules and buy stocks based on rules which dont take into account changing fundamentals. For example, anyone without blinders could have told you that brick and mortar retail was going to suffer long term, 2 decades ago and many big names indeed went under... yet they were still part of these big index funds as they decayed... Thus if you could pick your own stocks, you probably would have avoided the things like Sears, Mervyns, Neamans, Brook Brothers, etc etc and your gains would have been better if you had similar stocks but not the obvious long term turds.

Again, it just depends on whether or not you can do the research. Otherwise, trades are free today so there is nothing stopping anyone from simply making their own diverse portfolio that matches any fund they like without any management fees. Your fee will be your time which may or may not be worth it. Depends on how much you have invested and how much you make I suppose.",

This is the first time I've heard of a securities lending program in Fidelity but it's not the first brokerage to do this, IBKR also has a lending program, so the way it works should be similar. The 8.5% example is kind of extreme, but the actual yield you would get is based on how in-demand the stock is to short compared to the float, which is also the ""hard-to-borrow"" fee. For example, not very many people are short Microsoft stock so the stock is not in demand. Therefore, the cost of borrowing MSFT stock to short is not very high, essentially 0%. This means if you lend out MSFT shares, you will get basically a 0% yield.

You have to keep in mind that the Institutions (ie: Hedge Funds) trade against retail traders. A lot of analyst recommendations are just marketing. So you have a stock that looks good to the retailers. That means they want to buy and are willing to buy expensive. So the institutions sell. Which triggers the loss in confidence, analysts changing their mind, retailers selling off their stocks and the price goes down. At which point the institutions buy back the borrowed and sold off shares and voila... they sit pretty.

The thing in the market is that you always have to have someone to trade with / against. If you are buying somebody has to sell and vice versa. And institutions usually hold loads of shares. So what do you do when you want people to act a certain way? Marketing.",

If earnings are good, stock probably rise (of cause Intel fell because its all about growth, not just good earnings). 

Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are safest bet. No matter how bad/good earnings are, stock will go up no matter what (can fall temporary).

Amazon is strong company but it will be same as Netflix? Covid-19 is over, no more huge profit after Covid-19... sure... cloud, video stream but really... people want to travel, spend time outside etc.  I think Amazon won't grow or fall.

myc2xw,,stocks,post,1619369000,"Facebook and Snapchat could be in trouble (Facebook Vs apple)So first of all before I get in to why Facebook is in trouble I just want to say iam a share holder of Facebook.


So there is some reports that apple want to change iMessage and they are going to give it a fresh update. Apple wants iMessage to be more like a social media site and I think this could be a worrying situation for Facebook or it could flop for Apple.
Here's the link for the rumours

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/apple-reportedly-expanding-imessage-to-compete-with-facebook.html

Let's go to why I think this could be a success if apple plays their cards right. 1st reason is apple has good brand loyalty let's look at when they removed the headphone jack and brought airpods In. At first airpods got a lot of hate it didn't look like it was going to be a success but after time airpods itself can be a 100$ billion dollar company. Apples phone are a big success and there's no slowing down and finally iMessage it's self is a big success. Iam from the UK so iMessage isn't that big like it is in the USA WhatsApp is the bigger one and it's the same for the rest of the world but in the USA iMessage is big and that's also were Facebook makes most of their money. When apple release the new update I could see this being a success they could also steal users and screen time from Facebook and the other social media sites like Snapchat. I personally think Snapchat is in more trouble because most people use Snapchat to message only and if apple make iMessage look more attractive people could start leaving Snapchat.




On the other hand this could flop. One reason why I think it could flop is because iMessage is a closed ecosystem and if they keep it closed people wouldn't leave WhatsApp or Snapchat because they still want to message their friends on android. On the other hand if apple decide to open iMessage people could sell their iPhones and buy androids.

Another reason why this could potentially fail is because many companies have tried to compete with Facebook and they have all failed like Google for example they failed their attempt at a social media site.","['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'FB']"

I don't see Snapchat even considering this an upset, for Facebook more (based on their success and purely talking about them as individidual platforms, not the company), but Apples range as far as I remember is still small and the demographic is by far different.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
> Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
> It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
> As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> # The central bank takes the main stage
> “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
> So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
> There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
> The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
> “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
> Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
> Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
> The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
> “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
> Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
> # Tax hike prospects
> Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
> Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
> Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
> “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
> So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
> David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
> “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
> He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
> “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
> “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
> He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
> Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
> “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

> # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

> As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

> Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

> Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

> # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

> The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

> After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

> The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

> “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

> The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

> # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

> “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

> One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

> After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

> “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

> # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

> It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

> We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

> U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

> A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

> # Dips in Short Supply

> While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

> In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

> Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

> # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

> If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**

> The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

> It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

Personally I don't focus too much on individual stocks and instead pay attention to the overall markets. If the Nasdaq goes down, pretty much all stocks go down with it.

Nasdaq currently at 14016 with a 52 week high of 14175. SP500, 4200 appears to be the target number. Guessing both targets need to be hit  for at least a MINOR market correction/dip/entry point. Biden has a big speech on the 28th and he's known to set new market records every time he talks.

My best guess a dip Mon/Tuesday, Wed/Thur new market records because of Bidens speech and Friday no idea.",['NDAQ']
my22w6,,stocks,post,1619330287,"Arrival - UK based EV Startup backed by UPS, thoughts?Hi all, getting ready for a busy week ahead in earnings. I am trying to figure out what to make out of Arrival, an EV startup founded by a Russian guy who doesn't know anything about EVs and they're trying to do bold and daring things such as abandoning the classic approach of manufacturing cars with this new microfactories concept.

I checked their website and they're hiring left and right. About 1500 employees already and they're growing rapidly. Current market cap is around $10B which is 1/6th of Ford and 1/60th of Tesla.

Company looks pretty solid. Currently trading under ARVL. Any thoughts?

Microfactories are neat and innovative, but because they are micro they cannot vertically integrate fully I am assuming.  This will put some pressure on margins, but they will benefit on margins as well from their in house tech.

I don't see anything particularly innovative about their vehicles, most of their expertise seems to be manufacturing related, but will have to be proven at steady state.  Would be cool to see them team up with a major manufacturer as a provider of manufacturing tech.

I would wait on this one and watch it.  Last mile delivery is a competitive space, buses also.  They need to be able to offer a product with automation features, which seem to be coming from Waymo potentially, who could just as easily partner with their competitors on any fleet tenders.

https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/29/ups-deliveries-arrival-vans-waymo/

I would need to start see their order book build with other clients, otherwise they might not succeed.  Amazon went with Rivian.  USPS  went with Oshkosh.  

I don't know enough about their product to say why they didn't get those contracts, but I feel like maybe they're missing something... who knows, maybe they've got something in the works.  Lazy me says that a 130kwh battery for their vans that only produces 160km of range is not efficient or leading edge tech, but I didn't dig into the load assumptions, nor the driving conditions used to come up with that figure.

Considering that they're trading for almost 8x their booked revenues and haven't actually produced en masse yet, this is pretty high risk.

Please feel free to correct any of the above.  I am neither long nor short this stock.  If you can tell me why their product is better than their competitors, I will do some further DD.","['UPS', 'AMZN']"

It was all engineered by third party automotive firms in Coventry all ex JLR guys, the concept being based around what a company called Local Motors did a few years ago who I also worked for and they were rolling in money fast, I think the micro factory system has legs.

The vehicle is basically designed to be a knock down kit you can screw together by hand, it’s all rotation molded parts around a chassis made of extrusions so it’s easy to ship and parts can be made by third parties anywhere in the world on the cheap which makes expansion much easier.

While looking at the financials on Yahoo and other sites I see that the ""analysts"" have forecasted an EPS of $2.46. Based on their outstanding shares of 39.9 M and $2.46 I calculate a 1st qtr 2020 net income of 95.7 M.

At this point I have no faith in Fisker, Lucid, etc. They are just clones of existing EVs already available but without some of the benefits and ability to scale.

I think it's gonna be tesla, two or three traditional autos and a maybe one of the chinese companies. 

The startups are just too late which is too bad because I am definitely cheering for some like Rivian. Rivian is  my one wrench in the mix.

So that's pretty good news for TSLA.  Interestingly enough I've recently heard TSLA is now 'cheaper' than Peleton based on analysts forward earnings projections.... but those projections also place the current price of TSLA at what it should be worth in early 2023 (current fair value of ~$435).

That's not to say break-throughs/unexpected can't push that timeline up (or down).  I'm definitely a strong believer in TSLA's future and if you're long there's probably no great harm in investing now, other than potentially sacrificing investment time in the meantime (if this projection is correct).",['TSLA']

mxnrlg,,stocks,post,1619282861,"Ultimate HUYA DDThis is my excuse to dodge parenthood & stuff so I better make it a long one.

PART I:

1. Fundamentals: Can't post pictures here but look it up on YCharts. 

I generally use PS Ratio for growth tech stocks. Definition: PS Ratio = Price / Revenue Per Share (Note: YCharts uses the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Revenue Per Share in the denominator). Most growth tech companies are as low as 10 on the low side up to 30. Generally I try to catch companies I'm bullish on around 10; 2.7 is stupid low. This is the biggest streaming company in China and is avidly sought after by Tencent. Massive market and massive growth industry. Their PS is crazy low. The Price to Book Value is also fucking awesome for a growth tech company. Value investors look for companies less than 3 and this fits that parameter. This company is also jacked to the gills with cash. Check out their balance sheet. As of Q4 2020 their total assets are 12.4B and their total liabilities are 2.6B. They have 3.2B in pure cash. Year over year this company is putting out blow out numbers but their Q4 contracted a bit vs their Q3 of last year. But seriously: 3.2B in cash and the market cap is just over 4B. What kind of absurd mismatch is this especially when it is a money printing business too.

2) Technical/Price-Action/Analyst stuff: (had a picture from TD Ameritrade analyst reports)

6 Analysts projections: upper-bound is $29 and the median price target is $25.66. The stock jumped today a bit on news that the stock just got a buy rating: HUYA shares are trading higher after 86 Research upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a price target of $22 per share. We all know analysts are a bunch of pencil pushing idiots so take that with a grain of salt. Currently the price is $18.5 AH and it hasn't traded this low since July of 2020. The price was north of $35 as recent as a couple months ago. It has been consolidating at the $18 level waiting for news which brings us to the meat and potatoes of this post.

3: Proposed merger and Arbitrage strategy: The two biggest streaming companies in China are HUYA and DOYU. The King Maker aka Tencent is trying to merge these companies as they will dominate and have 80% market share if the merger is successful. Tencent has a major stake in both companies and a huge vested interest strategically as they are a video game company (among other things) and this would have vertical integration characteristics. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will be converted to .75 HUYA shares. The arbitrage strategy here is going long shares on DOYU and people shorting the hell out of HUYA. The amount of short interest on HUYA shows that the market is confident the merger will go through. If it DOESN'T go through then HUYA will no longer be shorted and the stock will sky rocket. If the merger DOES go through then you'll have a stake in the biggest streaming company in the biggest streaming market on planet earth.

4) Headwinds: China used BABA to send a message to monopolistic behavior. This was great news for the HUYA/DOYU merger because the uncertainty surrounding Beijeng's agenda was lifted a bit. Major companies, including Tencent, came out publicly to say they will make concessions where necessary. I expect this will hasten the negotiations between Tencent and Beijeng to get this through. The current time table for this merger to happen is the first half of 2021, which we are well on our way to the 2nd half. It is possible for this to happen in the 2nd half if negotiations stall. The other slight headwind is that DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling concerns but this is completely short run shit that gives me a better discount.

5) Institutional ownership: 52.4% of outstanding shares are owned by institutions. The two biggest players are ARK and Morgan Stanley. Fintel shows Morgan Stanley increasing their HUYA stake by 169% in the most recent filing to 22,095,743 shares (32% of the comany). Ark has the next most with 11,600,993 shares for 13.99%. (Check Fintel Huya Institutional ownership for this info)

6) Short Interest: Check the massive SI on this ticker. (Check shortsight for this info. free to subscribe and get daily updates)

34.4% of the float is shorted and 52.4% of the outstanding shares are owned by institutions. That leaves a fairly small left-over float size to publicly trade.

Mama CWood loves the stock. Massive institutional ownership with Morgan Stanley just making a huge investment. Pending merger. Artificially suppressed aka arbitrage short. I LIKE THE STOCK. I am playing the HUYA side with long calls and shares. It is a win win if the merger does or does not go through.

PART II:

The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. (this is found in many places, google it to confirm)

I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings)

You  will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares  Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public  (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the  float). (I had this picture from shortsight data but can't post pictures on this thread).

34.4% of the float is  shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and  assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the  arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491  gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if  you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares  Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The  float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get  11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has  11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us  retail gamblers.

Practically the  entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an  incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely  shorted. The fundamentals are the prettiest thing I've ever seen when it  comes to analyzing stocks.

Now I just need to decide if I sell out of literally everything and put it into HUYA","['GOOGL', 'MS', 'NDAQ']"
mxnrlg,gvtdj1j,stocks,comment,1619357082,"Great analysis. Chinese authorities is cracking down hard on anti competitive behavior at the moment.

mxnrlg,gvqsaco,stocks,comment,1619294418,"I don't think the arbitrage strategy is what's really happening right now. If you calculate how much HUYA you are essentially getting by buying DOYU you  still get a giant discount.

I have been long DOYU for a few months now and I like both HUYA and DOYU. I think HUYA is the safer play and as you said probably the better pick if the merger doesn't go through. I like the additional upside tho.

This stock has gotten severely beat down in the past few months due to the Alibaba's regulations and investigation.

1. JD logistics IPO announcement is going to coming in the next few weeks. 



2. The Chinese government should finish their regulation review on JD in the next few weeks, which would clear any uncertainty on the company. This would easily cause a 10% rally in 1 day.



3. The company's book value is $120/share. So there is 30-40% upside based solely on fundamentals. Politics aside.



4. Earnings are coming up for this stock near mid-end of May. Should expect a reversal by then.

100-50=50

mxcokd,,stocks,post,1619238821,"Is Amazon's stock price too expensive?I have many conversations with individuals who say that amazon is too expensive for them to invest in. Obviously this is not related to the metrics of the company but rather the fact that they don't want to fork over 3300 for one share. 

I own multiple shares of the company because I believe in what amazon is and will be in the future, but all the discussions I have where people refuse to buy into the company makes me think that it loses many opportunities because of its price. 

It's been stated that Bezos is probably keeping from a stock split because he wants to keep frequent trading by retail investors away, but I believe it might lead to an increase in stock price. 

If the price was lower, say after a split, would you be more inclined to purchase the stock?

Edit: so people's perception on the stock based on this post are a) stock splits are stupid, everyone can do fractional shares b) not everyone can do fractional shares c) yes, it is expensive and therefore stupid to buy d) the stock is great, the price is undervalued and I wish I could buy more.",['AMZN']

When the stock hits 4000 or 4500, questions of whether 3300 is expensive will be painful to reflect on.

mx4mf7,,stocks,post,1619210530,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 23, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 23, 2021**

Stocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.

Yesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. 

However, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

mwkisk,,stocks,post,1619142808,"Which is worse? Watching your gains evaporate, watching a stock run after selling or watching a stock run on your watchlist.Yes I know nobody can time the market. It doesn't mean it doesn't bother me! All of the above get under my skin. I think the worst for me has been watching the watchlist stocks run without me. I usually invest a lot of time researching before adding them there. I've resorted to buying a small part of my position right away and waiting for a lower price for the rest of it. 

Not taking the gains and watching it drop makes me feel like I was being too greedy. Not a good feeling. Stop losses at the target sell price are important. Setting a trailing stop 3 percent below the market price has helped me. A volatile stock would have a different percentage.

Watching the stock run after selling just sort of makes me laugh. Like watching your kid grow up and go to college. You appreciate the time you had and look forward to seeing what they become in the future.",

* Are you employed/making income? How much? - Yes, $153K a year. In a relationship ($55K a year) but single for tax purposes.
* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?) - House/Retirement/Kids eventually
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? - Within the next 1-2 years.
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) - Slightly risk averse

mz0ahw,,investing,post,1619450952,"What happened to GE's fraud case as accused by Harry Markopolos (Bernie Madoff whistleblower)?I remember it being touted as the biggest corporate fraud case in decades, when it happened in late 2019. 

I skimmed through his team's 169 page report, watched videos summarizing the report. A lot of it seemed credible. 

There were also other smoking guns: the CFO preemptively retires after the report drops, the share price drops 300% and holds there. There is an overhaul of upper management. They publicly admitted that they don't entirely adhere to GAAP. 

But what's happened since? Why isn't there more mainstream coverage about this? Were Harry's accusations right? What's SEC legal stance and actions on this? 

I don't wanna seem conspiratorial but it'd seem that most institutional investors have a vested interest in holding GE. 

More worryingly, the only coverage about the aftermath I can find, seems to be taken down: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-25/it-s-almost-like-the-shock-ge-short-thesis-never-happened

Assuming Markopolos is correct, it wouldn't be hard for GE to correct the issue. They could purchase reinsurance. They could recalculate reserves and increase held capital. They could construct certain positions with securities that pay out in the event of LTC reserve deterioration. Furthermore, as grim as it is to say, LTC is a product intended to primarily cover the cost of living in a nursing home.

Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Aetna common stock is being exchanged for $145.00 in cash and ***0.8378 shares of CVS*** Health common stock.  CVS Health is not issuing any fractional shares in the transaction. Instead, the total number of shares of CVS Health common stock that each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive is being rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each Aetna shareholder is entitled to receive cash for any fractional share of CVS Health common stock that the Aetna shareholder is otherwise entitled to receive.

The transaction values Aetna at $212 per share or approximately $70 billion. Including the assumption of Aetna’s debt, the total value of the transaction is $78 billion. The combined company's shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CVS.” The Aetna brand name will continue to be used in reference to the health insurance products. Going forward, Aetna will operate as a standalone business within the CVS Health enterprise and will be led by members of its current management team.

myzi38,,investing,post,1619448911,"Introduction to on-chain data analysis for blockchainsA unique benefit of public blockchains is every transaction and address can be viewed and analyzed. Economic data can be analyzed in unprecedented detail in what's called on-chain analysis. 

Here are some examples of popular on-chain metrics.

* [Liquid supply change](https://i.imgur.com/HyiWBaK.png) - supply in wallet addresses that has not been moved for at least 6 months

* [Exchanges net transfer](https://imgur.com/sI5uIDg) - coins moving on or off exchanges - indicative of available liquidity and market depth (amount needed to move price)

* [Coinbase Pro outflows](https://imgur.com/7qirkoL) - outflows usually mean movement to cold storage for long term holding, inflows can signal desire to sell, Coinbase Pro is of particular interest because of institutional usage

* [Accumulation addresses](https://i.imgur.com/KvIoeOp.png) - Bitcoin addresses that have received at least two transactions but have never spent funds, 'black hole' addresses

* [Bitcoin miner net position change](https://i.imgur.com/z1syaVo.png) - miners net selling or holding new coins

* [UTXO realized price distribution](https://i.imgur.com/5zrvlia.png) - amount of volume traded at each price level, sometimes used to infer resistance levels

The unprecedented transparency is one of the under-appreciated aspects of crypto markets. The information asymmetries we've seen in the stock or precious metals market and economic data are much lower. 

Instead of speculating on the status of a commodity squeeze like silver crypto traders can visualize one developing second by second with high precision. You can see if retail (minnows) or institutions (whales) are buying or selling. Whether old OG holders are cashing out or stacking more. Whether network activity is increasing, etc. 

In equities this level of data would often only be available if you worked in the company. It's another toolset for people who already use TA and use macroeconomic indicators. 

You can access data through [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [Santiment](https://santiment.net/) (also has off-chain sentiment data), [Cryptoquant](https://cryptoquant.com/), [Woobull](http://charts.woobull.com/). 

Resources for using on-chain data are [Glassnode Academy](https://academy.glassnode.com/), [Glassnode Insights](https://insights.glassnode.com/) newsletter, Santiment [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzP_Z3MrygWlbLMyrNmMkg) channel, on-chain analysts [1](https://twitter.com/WClementeIII) [2](https://twitter.com/woonomic), and any interview with [Willy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=willy+woo). This is the best way to learn the context behind each metric. 

Analyzing the flows, supply changes, accumulation patterns, etc is helpful in forming and sticking to an investment thesis in an asset class that is notoriously unpredictable, whether your goal is to hold or attempt to trade the [cycle](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/) top.",['TWTR']

I regularly check the automod removal logs and 99% of the posts being removed are frankly just really generic advice requests or basic questions. 

That said, I'd like to formulate some formal guidelines for differentiating between a post that should be in a daily thread and one that can have it's own thread.  I'd like for sufficiently complex topics to be able to generate insightful discussion - this is an inherently subjective threshold so someone's gonna be mad about their post not making the cut, but I think formalizing some guidelines should help.  

So, I was discussing this with /u/Emc87, and our initial thoughts were something along the lines of this: if you can google the answer to something it should not be a post here.  But if you can demonstrate that you have done a fair bit of research on something and are having trouble connecting the dots, or having trouble seeing the mechanics behind a concept, then that would likely be a good post to open up for discussion.  

This obviously creates a lot of room for interpretation - I've seen enough people in modmail arguing that ""how do I buy stock"" is a valid discussion topic that would help many people to know that we're not going to make everyone happy here.  But I would like to see what thoughts everyone has as to putting a semi-formal framework on these ideas, so that we can point to something when deciding which posts will be sent to the daily threads and which can have their own post.",['GOOGL']

mys3nh,,investing,post,1619422039,"Timing of real estate investments compared to timing the stock marketThe conventional wisdom and evidence w/ timing the stock market is that it's better to invest ASAP -- more has been lost waiting for dips than lost in dips.

I think we have a pretty mixed real estate market right now.

Not all real estate is residential real estate outside cities, which is in a state of under supply for demand.  Inner city residential isn't holding up.  Manufacturing square footage is great, malls not so much.  These kind of trends usually take a while to play out with real estate.  I think we also expect interest rates to continue rising over time which will eventually damp down future pricing.  Supply/demand issues aren't necessarily by themselves indicative of a bubble, and IMO, with real estate you should be looking at your cash flow from ownership versus cost to own... so whether or not you have pricing power to positively impact your cash flow going forward is just as important to analyze as how much you pay for it.",

However, I disagree with both. I think you can time both, but it's really about making sure you're not overpaying for assets.

For example, if you look in the stock market you will find some stocks that are still a good value despite the overall market 100% being in a bubble. The same goes for real estate. There are probably some real estate markets that will grow quite well over the next 5-10 years. I'm thinking the states where there is no income tax is a good example of good markets in general.

mym15t,,investing,post,1619398704,"Tax it now? Or tax it later?I’ve always heard the order of investing for retirement should go as follows:
Contribute to Employer Tax Deferred Plan up to the match amount
Max out Roth IRA
Back to Employer Plan and max it out
Contribute to Taxable accounts

That’s what we’ve been working on for the last three years. My wife has a 403(b) and a Roth IRA. I haven’t had an employee plan, so I’ve just been maxing out my Roth IRA and that’s it. 

I know the assumption people rely on for this plan is that their tax bracket in retirement will be higher than what it is now, hence taking the taxes now in lieu of taking them in retirement. 

I just got a job that offers a SIMPLE IRA (tax deferred account similar to 401(k)) with a 3% employer match. 

Our adjusted gross income last year (married filing jointly) was around 95k. 

Is this still the right plan to follow? Or should things be switched around and focus more on tax deferred plans? And other than just pure opinion or things you’ve heard before, what’s the reason for what you’re suggesting?",

mxaojd,,investing,post,1619230712,"The 100 Year Portfolio: A Look at Using the Dragon Portfolio as a Retail InvestorEDIT: I added the [MacroVoices podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDIifbY71g) where Chris Cole goes over the Dragon Portfolio. I would highly recommend listening to it as context for this post if you are not going to read the paper. 

- - - - - - - -

Chris Cole released a paper last year called ""The Allegory of the Hawk and the Serpent."" The paper detailed how investors could protect and build their wealth over a 100 year period. If you haven't read the paper, I would highly recommend doing so [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi95qub1ZXwAhVTHM0KHU7QDQMQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macrovoices.com%2Fguest-content%2Flist-guest-publications%2F3502-the-allegory-of-the-hawk-and-serpent%2Ffile&usg=AOvVaw1RpaeVw0O4wF4dO4MIpgs5). In it, he details how our idea of ideal portfolio construction has been warped by the last 40 years, namely an environment where interest rates have been falling. This has lead most investment advisors to recommend a stock/bond portfolio. This is also known as the 60/40 portfolio. 

The idea behind the 60/40 portfolio is that stocks and bonds are  anti-correlated, meaning when stocks go up, bonds go down and visa versa. This allows the investor to grow their wealth over time without major drawdowns. Avoiding major drawdowns is key in any portfolio construction. The issues arise when you start looking at periods beyond the early 80s. This was the time interest rates peaked, and they have been falling ever since. One of the question Chris Cole asks is ""how would this portfolio perform over 100 years?"" The answer is poorly. For two separate decades (the 30s and the 70s), this portfolio would have had significant drawdowns. Why? Because during these periods, stocks and bonds were positively correlated. Stocks and bonds moved up and down together. 

What is Chris Cole's solution? He calls it the Dragon Portfolio. A portfolio that has elements beyond those of stocks and bonds. He recommends the following allocation:

* 20% Gold
* 20% Long Equity
* 20% Low Risk Long Duration Bonds
* 20% Commodity Trend
* 20% Long Volatility

Not only does this portfolio perform well during periods like the 30s or 70s, but it also outperforms the traditional advice during the good decades. the portfolio also outperforms during good periods. Over the last 40 years, the Dragon Portfolio has an annualized rate of return of 10.1% while the 60/40 portfolio only returns 3.9% during the same period.

For the retail investor, the first three elements are easy enough for the average investor to achieve. Simply invest in GLD, TLT and the equity index of your choice. Commodity trend is doable as well. Use a simple trend following system allocated to a basket of commodities. You could do a 40-50 day cross over on a broad commodity etf like DJP or GNR. However, Long Volatility proves trickier. Most investors don't know how to go long volatility beyond buying the VXX etf. Unfortunately, the carry cost makes this untenable. Take a look at the VXX chart over a five year time horizon. This thing is consistently melting down. Here is where Chris Cole makes his pitch. He offers professionally managed Long Volatility funds that fit into the Dragon Portfolio. Only downside is you must be a ""Qualified Investor."" Yes, qualified, not accredited. IE your net worth needs to be over 5 million dollars to even have a conversation about his products. 

Needless to say, the average retail investor does not have this net worth or else he'd be lying on a beach after telling his boss to shove it. My goal is to test a simple long volatility strategy in combination with the other elements of the Dragon Portfolio to see if the average retail investor can invest using Chris Cole's methodology. To do this, I opened up a paper trading account with $100,000 and will be tracking this portfolio on a weekly basis. I broke down the allocations as follows:

* 20% GLD - Gold ETF
* 20% TLT - Long Duration US Government Bonds
* 20% RSP - Equal weight S&P 500. This tends to outperform the S&P 500 over time by about 1-2% per year
* 20% DJP - Long Bloomberg commodity index. Commodities are in an uptrend right now. I may change this to GNR.
* 1% IWM 90 day Long Straddle (rolling every 30 days) - Long Volatility representing long/short 100 shares of the Russell 2000. 

You might be wondering why I am doing the Russell 2000 straddle. Two reasons. First, the straddle is the definition long volatility. You are long a call and a put while betting the value of either leg will go further than the implied price represents. Chris Cole mentions in an interview on MacroVoices this is the broad outline for the long volatility component he uses. Second, the IWM is a small enough ETF that a $100,000 account can have 20% represented by a single put and call contract. We aren't trying to leverage this portion to the hilt. We are trying to keep the theta burn small enough that when a big risk on or risk off event happens, the straddle spikes up. The goal is to have anti-correlated assets classes.

[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/25913Hp) are my current allocations. I'll be posting updates every week and comparing the performance to a 60/40 portfolio as well as a long equity portfolio (100/0) to see how they perform. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice on the strategy.","['LEG', 'SPGI']"

mwvqvk,,investing,post,1619185962,"Fear of capital gains tax presents a buying opportunityLeave the politics out of this discussion, we're just talking about the impact on markets.

The narrative yesterday was that stocks fell on fears of substantially higher capital gains tax on incomes over $1M annually. Certainly, that makes stocks a less attractive investment for high income investors because it hurts their risk/return profile. But, if they're selling stocks to move assets elsewhere, that creates an opportunity for the rest of us, right? 

After all, the expected future free cash flows of the underlying businesses haven't changed, right? So if valuations are unchanged, but prices are lower, that is a buying opportunity. Perhaps one could argue that the lower investment incentive (for high earners) could hurt the economy as a whole? And thus that mechanism is weighing on stocks and actually hurting business valuations? That's a little different narrative than the one we're hearing right now though.

I realize a 1% drop is pretty trivial, but if the Biden plan moves forward and looks like it will pass (or does pass), we could see more price movement on the same fears. My theoretical question is, will that present a buying opportunity for everyone who WON'T be subject to the higher capital gains rate?",

*Consider this: They make money off headlines.*

The entire flock is preying on news-worthy quips like vultures on a corpse. Tom Lee at Fundstrat would be bullish during the apocalypse, Gordon won't ever raise his price target, Cramer cuts coke deals with the CEOs he's in love with, and the whole bunch likes to hear themselves talk (like giving stock advice rapid fire).

So how do you truly figure out **what stocks are hot... or not?**

*Research the macro situation surrounding the company, to name a few:*

* Sector Tailwinds
* Economics
* Current and projected financials
* Leadership

Then invest in companies:

* *you believe in—hopefully, not always—with healthy balance sheets vs. their competitors.*
* *Whose products and services tickle you.*
* You *could sell to your neighbor.*

Determine **the investment thesis**—the key reasons you believe in this investment—and create a narrative. Positive and negative. Know the outcomes of both scenarios, write them down, and evaluate the risk.

Then? Jump blindly.

*kidding*

Adjust based on your preferences, but starting positions with a 1/4th to 1/2 of your total allocation works well. You can do some quick math and figure out what portfolio percentage you want to allocate to a new position. **Ease into it, slow and steady.**

Buy the dips with the remainder, and don't chase stocks upwards, only down (within reason). And don't listen to anyone who tells you that ""diversifying"" is the only way, when you put in the work, you know **which sectors have favorable tailwinds AND are fairly valued**.

mx1aby,,investing,post,1619201124,"My Alteryx (AYX) DD: This isn't a dip to buy, it's part of their long decline.After a fly-by-night post a few days ago said Alteryx was a buy, I decided to do some DD. I've wanted to for awhile, at the time of this writing I owned AYX (buying ~$70 back in 2019) and it seemed like the stock could do no wrong as it exploded to ATHs (~$178) in Mid-2020. However, it's currently trading at $84 and the question is, is this a dip worth buying or is it finally time to cut off my AYX position? Personally, I've disliked the product when I've seen it and dislike their lack of R&D. When they become ""old"" feeling, I don't think they'll survive. I think they may already be at that point. Also, I heard a rumor but don't want to make it seem bigger than it is so I'll be adding some hypotheticals below.

**Disclaimer:** After doing this research I no longer hold any position in AYX.

**R/Investing TLDR:** I've already sold my AYX shares

**R/WSB Risky TLDR:** and will take a short position (buying puts for post earnings and after next quarter's earnings)

Most of my numbers come from [their most recent 10-K](https://investor.alteryx.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).

**Bull case:**

AYX is growing. Their ""dollar based net expansion"" rate is above 100% at 122%, which fits comfortably around [the Docusign/Cloudflare zone](https://softwareequity.com/the-impact-of-net-retention-on-valuation-for-public-saas-companies/). Not bad.  However, this metric has been shrinking for 2 years now and if anything, it shows they don't know how to improve this metric any longer. They've dropped 1-2% per quarter every quarter for 2 whole years. Because they do trailing 4 quarters, it's actually lower than 122% right this moment but we don't know exactly how much.

They have nice case studies. They have grown customers up to 7083 customers, and revenue to $495.3M (+18.5%). Guidance for ARR is $555-565M for this year. Their margins are awesome at 91%.

**Bear case:**

The co-founder stepped down to [bring on a new CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteryx-ayx-appoints-new-ceo-raises-q3-top-line-outlook-2020-10-06). This is typically something you'd do when your company was at a new stage of it's life. That stage is sometimes ""fuck R&D, just increase sales/marketing and get this to as many companies as possible."" I think that's where we are, and I'll show it below.

Additionally, the new CEO had to [instantly fire the CRO for offensive tweets](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664513-alteryx-shares-drop-after-chief-revenue-officer-resigns).

Now I'm going to get into the real meat. What started this whole thing? The rumor I heard is that some larger companies aren't interested in renewing anymore, and I think we've seen that already in the numbers. I'll do some analysis below but the main question is: do you think this is a huge signal that other companies are starting to drop AYX, or is this just a temporary blip and the new CEO is going to come up with new valuable solutions? Based on the middling CEO above, and the lack of R&D that I'll highlight below, my thought is AYX is going to have trouble retaining customers moving forward.

The strategy straight from their 10k is:

* ""to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy."" Cool, but that means they need to both land AND keep in order to expand.

Their revenue is growing, but if you look at their subscription revenue only, it's only growing by 3%, compared to their other services growing 37%. That means most of their revenue growth isn't new contracts or customers or even added users within contracts, it's added services. These services have an 85% margin so I expect their 91% margins to start to drop. I'm much more concerned with their actual growth looking to be closer to 3% in subscription revenue. That 3% number has been **dropping** every year!

* ""We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels."" Boo. I don't think they're to that point as a company yet, yet their numbers show that they are definitely spending most of their money on marketing/sales. Currently, 51% of their expenses are spent on marketing. In fact, R&D has been the smallest part of their expenses every year since they went public. That doesn't make sense to me. This is a personal feeling but it feels like they're not continuing to develop what customers may need in the future.

* ""with  an increased  focus  on Global  2000 companies"" Here's the big one. In their 10k they specify that they have ~750 of the top 2000 companies, and that this is their strategy going forward. What if those big customers start to drop off?

If my thesis is true that big companies don't quite jive with AYX and may start leaving or shrinking their contracts, this could be really bad for AYX especially since it's their top focus.

AYX charges $5195/user/year for designers and $2100/user/year for others. The average contract value is hard to pinpoint, but we can look through the years at a few analyses and one of my own. From the S1 in 2017, [an analyst](https://medium.com/@alexfclayton/alteryx-s-1-breakdown-4a711683f6c) stated that annual contract value was $40.7K. In 2019, [another analyst](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/04/24/alteryx-empowers-customers-to-turn-data-into-actionable-insights/?sh=2951aedd4690) said a typical new customer comes in at an average deal size of $10,000-$11,000.  If we just divide revenue by customers we get $70k/customer.  However, larger customers are obviously larger since they pay per user. In 2020, [another analyst](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/29/why-alteryx-focusing-large-companies-fuel-growth.aspx) said that 33% of their revenue is from the Global 2000, so using the 750 number from their 10k that gets us to $220k/customer.

However this quote gives us a better baseline for a top customer of AYX: ""Last year, the number of customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $1 million more than doubled, while the number of transactions worth more than $500,000 tripled."" The biggest customers are probably worth at least $1M if not more.

Finally though, what if one of the really really big customers leave (going back to my rumor)? Someone with multiple teams adding up to 1000 analysts? Using the S1 link above, at the time they stated ""no customer had **more than** 10% of their total revenue."" That probably means that at least one customer **DID** have up to 10% of their total revenue. If that's the case, that huge contract could have been worth **$3.7M** based on revenue at that time (years ago), and it could be worth more now.

I want to check that figure: Let's say a major company has ~14k corporate workers, maybe 10% of them max would be analysts or desire access to those tools. Some of them would be normal users while some would be design users. Using some rough assumptions, 9% * 14k * $2100 + 1% * 14k * $5195 would be around $3.3M.  I think the $3.7M ARR figure is at least reasonable for a large customer.

Finally, the average contract length is 2 years for an AYX customer. A lot of the big companies are coming up on contract renewal decisions. One point against this is: I've searched major companies job postings with ""Alteryx"" in the description, and a lot of them still exist.


**Bottom line:** what would happen if a large, $3.7M ARR contract left AYX tomorrow? Not that much by itself.

But, if you believe it's a signal for other large companies to do the same, and you don't think they have enough new customer revenue (maybe ~3% and dropping each year?) to make up for it, and their expansion/service revenue is higher cost/lower margin, and their R&D won't save them because they haven't focused on it enough, then this is bad for AYX.

If you think it's just one company and doesn't matter because its a rumor, then this is your time to buy.

I think it's a signal that things are about to get worse for AYX and I've already sold my shares.","['NDAQ', 'MMM']"

Alteryx were not particularly happy when they found out but this wasn't technically against their T&Cs. 

Alteryx desktop was fun to play with and tableau integrations etc are useful but it's just not practically scalable for any ML imo.

1. Power Query, Power Pivot, and Power BI can easily do all the of the same data transformation/modeling/blending/reporting without buying any licenses. It can't mimic Alteryx's data science packages but does any professional actually use those instead of python/R?
2. Alteryx has much friendlier UI/UX but the MS Office team has been doing an incredible job with Office 365 making it super user friendly and powerful. I could easily see them creating a slick O365 product for codeless data blending and analytics. Or just tie Power Apps, Flow, and Data Factory together into a single, simple UX. 
3. Adding an Alteryx copycat to the O365 family with out-of-the-box connectivity to all the other O365 services seems like a huge perk. Seamless integration between Excel, One Drive, Power BI, and Active Directory sounds super nice to me.

Anecdotally, I'm Alteryx Core certified and fluent in M and python. A lot of times for data transformation I'll go with power query just because the native Excel integration makes it quick and easy. For more advanced jobs I'll go to python for the flexibility.

That is almost 80% growth in revenue year over year at the lower end, very impressive. 

**Opinion** (Ignore this)

I think this seems like a business about to finally turn the corner and become a cash flow machine. The growth figures are really great and they are starting to generate some cashflows. It is still very expensive but at present it is kinda justifying it price with great numbers. At current prices it is trading at 46X Sales. It will need to continue growing at this rate for a few more years to justify it's price. 

Doing some bad back of envelope calculation, assuming a 12x sales multiple in 2030, (Google is trading at close to 9X sales right now.) and a return expectation of 10%. It will need to grow at close to 28% through out the decade to get that return. I know this mental model is very shoddy but it is very fun to play around with and get what sort of  growth figures is required to get great returns.",['GOOGL']

mx7aye,,investing,post,1619218741,"Ideas for investing in growth in the sunbeltThe southern US is growing much faster than the rest of the US, especially places like the Phoenix MSA and Texas Triangle. Of the top 10 most populous cities in the US, the only four that have experienced more than 10% population growth in the past decade have been in Texas and Arizona. Austin in particular (#11th most populous US city) grew 24% in the past decade and is probably the hottest real estate market in the US right now. Anyone who lives in these areas, especially Texas, knows how how many people from places like California are going to Texas for cheaper CoL amongst other things. I'd provide links but I'm not sure if they'd get my post deleted by AutoMod - city/state growth is readily available.

That being said, real estate is the most obvious investment opportunity to profit off of this demographic shift. My only exposure to real estate as a 25 year old just starting my career is FundRise and REITs - FundRise has a clear focus on southern real estate, especially in TX, and with enough research you can find REITs (like MAA, CPT, BRT) that invest primarily in the sunbelt region.

Other ideas I've had are power/utilities companies like PNW. One might even combine this demographic perspective with climate change speculation - people are moving to hot places that are going to keep getting hotter; air conditioning stocks like CARR may be a good choice?

So form my perspective, I can only really think REITs/utilities/AC. I wanted to give my own two cents on how to profit off of this growth but also see if people here had other ideas as to specific sectors or stocks (or non-stock market ideas) and spark discussion. I'm also curious if people here have ideas for investing in other demographic trends such as aging population.","['MAA', 'CARR', 'PNW']"

mwx0rd,,investing,post,1619189538,"Enbridge: Critical Infrastructure in the Green RevolutionThe green revolution is upon us. Enbridge is a critical energy infrastructure business known for transporting oil and natural gas. It also has a sizeable renewable segment. What you might not be aware of is how well that stacks up in the renewables space and how such companies are including non-renewable power in their total outputs.

For capacity context, the International Renewable Energy Agency released its [2020 Renewable Capacity Statistics ](https://www.irena.org/publications/2021/March/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2021)which provides insights into the sector as a whole.

 I have ranked Enbridge with various renewable companies in terms of **current net capacity** (the maximum output of electricity a generator can produce under ideal conditions) **minus natural gas capacity,** which[ according to the International Renewable Energy Agency is an alternative fossil fuel. ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Apr/IRENA_Report_GET_2018.pdf)Definitions for what constitute *renewable* natural gas vary and you will see further examples below, but this number is included where available. The only outputs considered are strictly renewable: solar, water, wind, biomass, and geothermal power. I have not included energy generation statistics (how much energy is actually output) because this varies based on operating capacity and conditions (eg. weather events will lower output).  


All data has been sourced from the latest publicly available ESG or Annual Reports and provided below. 

 

|**Company**|**Net Renewable Capacity (MW)**|
|:-|:-|
|Brookfield Renewable|18,884|
|Innergex Renewable|2,742|
|Boralex|2,455|
|Enbridge|1,727|
|Algonquin|1,456|
|Northland Power|1,323|
|Transalta Renewables|1,619\*\*|

\*\* \*\*Transalta Renewables as at Dec 31 2020 listed only gross renewable MW and not net, which is significantly lower. 

&#x200B;

 **Brookfield Renewable:** by far the largest output capacity and zero natural gas facilities. The majority of net capacity comes from Hydro and Wind. 

 **Innergex Renewable:** The majority of net capacity comes from Wind and Hydro. Again no natural gas. 

 **Boralex:** 82% of net capacity is derived from Wind. Least diversified of the group. 

 **Enbridge:** Majority of renewable capacity generated by Wind. Renewables represent 3% of EBITDA and appx. $200MM in annual contracted revenues. 

 Combined Current Renewable Power Generation outputs:  
• 1,392 MW is generated by North American wind facilities;  
• 255 MW is generated by European offshore wind facilities;  
• 80 MW is generated by North American solar facilities in operation 

 **Algonquin**: The latest data from 2021 sources showed FY19 figures. You will see coal listed here: the Asbury coal plant was closed in March 2020. Furthermore, a significant portion of their capacity is from natural gas (50%), which is from non-renewable sources and thus not included. 

 **Northland Power:** Included in their total output is ‘efficient’ natural gas, which accounts for \~60% of net capacity. While the outcome is reduced emissions, it is still not a renewable source and therefore not included in total renewable capacity. 

 **Transalta Renewables:** Similar to Algonquin and Northland, a significant portion of capacity is from natural gas (\~60%). I was unable to find updated net capacity statistics, which are significantly lower than gross, thus TA ranked last. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Net capacity is an important metric in measuring where a renewable company stands, but it is not the only one. Revenues are impacted by total output and pricing, of which the weather events in Texas provided an eye-opening example. Nevertheless, what we see from the above comparison is that Enbridge is already well positioned amongst common North American “renewable” names, albeit far behind big players like Brookfield. Looking through the above company ESG and Annual Reports highlighted further forays into traditional renewable sources, while also noting investments in **renewable natural gas**. Let’s not forget the critical role Enbridge will play in RNG transmission alongside their [own RNG production.](https://www.enbridgegas.com/Natural-Gas-and-the-Environment/Enbridge-A-Green-Future/Renewable-Natural-Gas) 

 Make of this information what you will. The market is currently discounting their business with the secular oil decline, and not fully considering Enbridge’s ability to innovate and partner alongside a growing global energy infrastructure network, particularly in the NG/RNG space. I am bullish.

They also own a large amount of infrastructure assets, such as natural gas pipelines, which RNG companies can use to distribute their products (gotta heat my home whether it NG or RNG). In the current environment (hard to build new pipelines) these assets become more valuable. They also become more valuable since asset prices are going up due to the current low rate environment and stimulus.

I have been using their product Omnipod for the past decade or so. As far as I'm aware, it is the only insulin pump that is wireless. At this current moment, there are other insulin pumps include additional features like integration with continuous glucose monitors, Omnipod has partnered with Tidepool, a nonprofit that has created an automated insulin dosing application (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005324/en/Tidepool-Completes-FDA-510-k-Submission-of-Tidepool-Loop).

This is a HUGE deal for type 1 diabetics (apart from Tandem's t:slim X2 which currently has a feature BasalIQ but this has tubing so not wireless (https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/providers/products/basal-iq)). Having your insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor communicate and automatically adjust is heading towards the direction of creating an 'artificial pancreas' and makes managing diabetes so much better.

That means the pump system is paired with a continuous blood glucose monitor which provides real time blood sugar read outs and real time insulin delivery. 

This is a big deal as the current Loop system is skunkworks project which works great but is not mainstream. 

Tl;dr.  Omnipod is on the cusp of being part of a truly FDA approved artificial pancreas system and their tech is the only one that is entirely wireless (no tubes).

mw4jei,,investing,post,1619097477,"PSA: Stock promotion and suspicious stock recommendationsFor those new to Reddit and to investing subreddits - many people often complain that r/investing mods are too draconian in removing posts and comments.

One reason is that we often get posts from bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. This morning - an account which only posted porn in the past to collect karma suddenly starts to post investing advice and stock recommendations.

One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.

If you are new to reddit r/investing \- and you wish to post dd please see the wiki guidelines for appropriate dd here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules)

32, turning 33 in July. United States. 

>Are you employed/making income? How much?

Unemployed, but unemployment is giving me 15/hr in a 40 hour equivalent period. 

>What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)

Retirement and make extra money.

I want to retire at 65. About 32 years.

70% safe.

No debts or expenses. I currently have 15K in my savings account and 3K in my checking accounts. 


Yes, I just started a IRA Roth with fidelity. I currently put 1000 dollars in the 2020 year on a target date fund 2050 (FIPFX).

> Apple will expand its advertising business, according to two people familiar with its plans, just as it brings in new privacy rules for iPhones that are likely to cripple the ads offered by its rivals, including Facebook.


>The iPhone maker already sells search ads for its App Store that allow developers to pay for the top result. In searches for “Twitter”, for example, the first result is currently TikTok.


>Apple now plans to add a second advertising slot, in the “suggested” apps section in its App Store search page. This new slot will be rolled out by the end of the month, according to one of the people, and will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches.


>Apple declined to comment.


>The expansion is the first concrete sign that Apple plans to enhance its own advertising business at the same time as it shakes up the broader $350bn digital ads industry led by Facebook and Google.


>Apple’s forthcoming software update, iOS 14.5, will ban apps and advertisers from collecting data about iPhone users without their explicit consent. Most users are expected to decline to be tracked, dealing a huge blow to how the mobile advertising industry works.


>Apple has said the changes will improve the privacy of its users, but some critics have accused the company of hoping to boost its own fledgling advertising business. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said: “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track with their competitive interests.”


>Apple has long wanted to be a big player in mobile advertising. In 2010, it paid $275m to acquire Quattro Wireless, a mobile advertising company, after being beaten by Google in the bidding for $750m AdMob.


>The same year, it launched iAd, a multiyear effort to build an advertising business.


>At launch, iAd had a minimum contract price of $1m, but within a year it had cut the requirement by half. Apple tried to maintain creative control of ads and was reticent to share user data with marketers, according to analysts at Bernstein. Two years later Apple cut the minimum contract to just $50 and the whole effort was shut down in early 2016.


>Meanwhile, the market for online advertising has boomed, with annual sales of $378bn, according to the market research group Insider Intelligence.


>Google and Facebook are the two biggest players in the market, but Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly attacked their business models as unsustainable because of how they accumulate large troves of data to target their ads.


>Bernstein estimated that Apple currently earns around $2bn a year from search ads in the App Store, with 80 per cent margins. Apple also sells ads in its Stocks and News apps.


>A second advertising slot in the App Store is likely to appeal to advertisers after the iPhone’s privacy changes reduce the effectiveness of targeted ads. But there is more than money at stake, according to Eric Seufert, a mobile advertising expert.


>A decade ago, the App Store played a critical role in how consumers discovered new content. Seufert told the tech site Stratechery earlier this year that Apple used to be “king maker — if you got featured, your company valuation might increase by a hundred million dollars.”


>He suggested that Apple now wishes to regain this level of control. “If Apple cripples mobile advertising, then the App Store becomes the primary discovery point for apps again, and Apple decides how people use our iPhones, Apple decides which apps are the most popular,” he said.","['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'TWTR']"

mvwh0z,,investing,post,1619062572,"Reconciling the Intelligent Investor with Current Bond yields.Ok, I’ve just finished The Intelligent Investor for the first time. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with investing as Graham defines it (as opposed to speculating) and the current situation with bond yields with his advice that you should keep at least 25% allocated because of the potential for things to change in the future. 

I’ve also been a fan of Ray Dalio’s advice, and recently read his post on avoiding bonds altogether.(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio)

These two thought streams are seemingly at odds, and the best I can come up with is that Graham’s advice didn’t take into account such low bond yields ever existing, and I’m probably better off following Dalio’s advice:

“ I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to US dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls.”

I’ve gotten rid of bond ETFs completely from my portfolio, and now have some gold, emerging Asia markets, commodities, foreign value ETFs to replace them.

I’d love to hear all of your thoughts on both reconciling Graham’s investment approach with current bond yields and on Dalio’s thoughts. What do you think?",

mvwh0z,gveuvqj,investing,comment,1619067991,"Be very careful reading into what’s going.  In general people epic fail at complex systems.  No one predicted the large number of retail investors joining the market due to Covid nor gamblers switching to the stock market.  Most of what is getting publish is cherry picking data to prove their point.  Very few go out of the way to try to get a basic understanding and will recognize that all the data isn’t available publicly.  It is also a very complex system so trying to make short term predictions is hard because there are simply to many variables.  So you can say what is happening right now will not last forever due to simple mathematical properties but when will the market catch up to reality who knows.  When it goes it will not be for one reason, there will be multiple complex interactions just like 2008.

If bonds are a bad investment because interest rates are too low then why are the largest players buying them?  Means the have other uses besides getting the return.  What happens if bond yields go up any significant amount?  Well the world is in a debt bubble so when companies try to refinance they won’t be able too.  So they default and assets are sold to cover their debt.  Then you have to go a step further and ask what does that mean?  When this occurs money is destroyed and liquidity in the system is smaller since the thing lending the money didn’t get made whole.

Then you have another fact when interest rates go down the bond is worth more.  So even though most bonds are paying very little interest the note itself has been appreciating in value.  Since bonds can’t really go down much more they will stop appreciating in value.  For the last 40 years people have been told to move to bonds in retirement.  Most projections for pension funds and 401k is to earn 6 to 7%.  With an aging population there simply won’t be enough people to sustain even that.  Would need to grow the economy through actual production not asset speculation.

There isn’t going to be inflation in consumer goods long term because you have to have an increase in wages with relatively the same production.  The other thing you can get inflation is through supply shocks which are usually temporary.  The goods going up in price now are due to speculation(lumber) and supply shocks.  Most of the money being created goes to asset purchases which inflates asset price.  So far all debt driven bubbles for asset purchases have popped.  The more debt you put into the system the bigger the pop.  No one knows when it will pop but no assets will be safe when it does because people will have to sell high quality assets to cover for loses in low quality.  This is why buffet has a large cash pile because he can go in and buy the high quality assets at a discount.",

The subscriber shortfall, which caused the stock to drop more than 10% in after-hours trading, was blamed on issues related to the coronavirus. Simply put, the pandemic gaveth, but also taketh away. “We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup.”


Net cash from operations surged to $777 million in the quarter from $260 million and free cash flow of $692 million was up from $162 million. Netflix confirmed a key metric — that it’s on track to free cash flow break even this year and doesn’t need outside financing anymore to fund day-to-day business. That was a milestone affirmed in the company’s January report, and only reaffirmed the bull thesis as the entire entertainment business continues its shift to streaming.

Jaguar Land Rover is to temporarily shut down production at two of its main UK factories because of a shortage of computer chips, in the latest sign of the difficulties facing the global car industry during the pandemic.

It is understood the shutdown is scheduled to last at least a week, although the company will continue to monitor its chip supply before committing to a reopening date.

The automotive industry is used to running lean “just-in-time” supply chains that minimise the amount of cash tied up in factory warehouses. However, the global nature of the chip shortage has strained carmakers as they compete directly with tech companies for supply.

Manufacturing will continue at JLR’s Solihull plant. JLR’s international factories in Slovakia, Brazil and China are as yet unaffected.",

mvoso0,,investing,post,1619037311,"$KARO - Comprehensive DD - Recent IPO - Exec Summary**Exec Summary for those that want a TL:DR**

Firstly - I am an existing shareholder, own around 900 shares with an average buy price of $34 (so I am down on this... but in the current market, who isn't). KARO are a leading global provider of vehicle telematics. The proprietary in-house technology provides the best intelligent, actionable data to fleet operators and security for all vehicle owners - across 23 countries over 5 continents. Most interesting areas of the business to me are their AI Video & Fleet Telematics, along with how they use their data to sell used cars and insurance in the future. I am impressed that they seem to keep developing the business, whilst maintaining a very healthy 15% margin.

* KARO is a holding company, the actual company is Cartrack
* 1.3m subscribers with 50 billion data points each month - data provides KARO with a huge opportunity for growth
* Business has continued strong growth through Covid (16% compared to 22% CAGR previously), expected rate is 26% for future years
* Free cash flow around 25%
* Prior to delisting from JSE, to list on NASDAQ and then do an inwards investment back onto the JSE - the stock price hit $629, with a share consolidation taking place at 10:1 - giving at all time high of $62.90 per share. Typically South African investment is more conservative that US/EU investors - who are more accepting of potential earnings forming part of the share price.
* Price to earnings is 28x - which is low in their industry, with the average being around 53x

**Products & Services**

What does KARO currently offer?

B2B - known as 'My Fleet' - Live Vision to make sure the driver is concentrating and not on their phone, insurance telematics, fleet management and optimisation, stolen vehicle recovery and fleet administration services. All services typically outsourced, not many companies I know of will invest in developing this tech themselves which is good for Karo.

B2C - known as 'My Car' - Vehicle protector, stolen vehicle recover (with promise to customer), crash alert to emergency services and insurance telematics.

**Customer Profile**

**South Africa -** De Beers, MAN, Avis, SA Taxi, Super Sport, Hino and many more - company originates from SA and very strong YOY performance here.

**Rest of Africa** \- Toyota, Cat, Moove and NCBA

**Europe** \- LaFarge, Telefurgo, Green Galaxy and Sonae MC

**Asia** \- Singapore Prison Service, ORIX, Grab Rentals & Asia Brewery

Lots more to list - company has accounts open in the UK and US - with very small amounts of trade at the moment, but they have a track record of aggressive expansion whilst maintaining margins.

**Financials (Converted from ZAR to USD... took a while, so apologies if you spot any errors)**

Without doubt my favourite part of this company, extremely strong performer and growth looks very positive, with sufficient results to back up projections.

Low Debt - $1.2m

Total Cash - $7m

Free Cash Flow Margin - 25%

Total Assets - $140m

Total Liabilities - $56m

Debt Coverage - Well covered by operating cash flow (2019%)

Gross Margin - 71%

Revenue - $167m (c.4.5x market cap)

Earnings - $27.7m (roughly 15% margin & 28x market cap - industry average listed on Nasdaq is c.50x)

I will post a link to their IPO pack in the comments section - I have looked at the financials over and over, **I really struggle to see any negatives but if you find any, please can you leave a comment as I want to keep educating myself.**

**Bull Case - Top 4 Points**

Aggressive, rapid and consistent CAGR - in the 20% range. I absolutely love this, I know I'm down right now but my price target to exit this stock is around $45 as a low estimate. Even with the market performing badly, I am not worried about my investment here. It isn't speculative, they are delivering.

Big data - its been big for a long time, I'm convinced it will continue to be big in the future. They already generate 50 billion data points a month from their existing contracts. They are looking to get further integrated with the insurance market and second hand car sales. Knowing how people drive through their current offerings is going to be huge in selling products that instantly fit with the consumers goals. If they drive fast... maybe upsell the car and have an insurance package wrapped up to help seal the deal. If they are more conservative drivers but have a powerful car, sell something more appropriate. I think this is a major opportunity for the business.

The world is going to see more crime, insurance premiums are rising, people want more protection and Karo offer a service that fills this space. Yes, there is telematics competition but in the nicest possible way car theft in the regions they currently operate in is pretty high and in regions that they don't yet operate in. Factor this alongside how much crime will increase in a post covid world (due to poverty increasing), I think that their CAGR of 26% will be achieved. Rich get richer... poor get poorer etc, its sad but generally true. Those with money will want to protect their valued assets without risking their own personal wellbeing.

Businesses need what Karo are selling. Whether its AI controlled systems or human, fleet management want 99% plus optimisation, with Karo's growth and products on offer, they simply must be offering a high quality product. Live vision & fleet tracking is something I can see growing more and more. I know from personal experience of having to deal with a particularly painful Brexit, this would have been a life saver had all the fleet been managed in this way and could be traced at a click of a button. Integrated supply chains rely on this real time data, which to my disbelief doesn't currently exist throughout the world. Note - biggest single customer represents less than 2% revenue, so they are heavily diversified.

**Bear Case - Top 4 Points**

No major contracts in USA, Germany, France or UK. I don't know why, maybe it isn't in their strategy right now, but I'd really like to see them get a big contract in one of these regions. I'm sure it will come but it isn't there right now and although they may well do well in China - the markets I mention are strong and relatively stable compared to South Africa and current countries that they operate in.

Volume - its pretty low, the good news is... its a buyers market - the spreads aren't great, so would only enter with a limit order if you did decide to invest, be patient and I'd say no real need to click the ask button right now.

Competition - there is clear competition in the telematics industry, I'm not even going to try and counter this as its a basic fact. I have based my investment on the numbers I see in their investor pack, only you can decide whether these numbers are suitable for your investment and offer competitive value against other investment opportunities.

The number of risks listed in their SEC prospectus filing was pretty crazy - my positive spin on this is that they are aware of their risks, honest about them and have strategies to counter/mitigate against them. I'll post the link so you can check this out too, but please do before making a decision on whether to invest.

**Share Structure**

Relatively simple section - NASDAQ is the priority listing, total of c.21,000,000 shares - 20,000,000 held by insiders with a 180 day lock up. 9,000,000 listed on the JSE as in inwards listing.

Cartrack (KARO) used to be listed solely on the JSE - but due to expansion plans, has now listed on Nasdaq... it was listed the same day as UTME and genuinely believe a lot of investors missed this IPO due to the hype and price increase on UTME.

The company was previously valued at over $1 billion on the JSE and the CEO didn't sell any shares, as he went on record to say that he felt the company was worth at least $1.5 billion.

**Key Catalysts**

Earnings are due soon - I have spoken to their Investor Relations team and expected first week of May. I'm expecting that these are positive.

Covid risk lowering, more people returning to normal - cars left unattended in public places, more travel, more collisions, insurance going up and people using telematics to help reduce the total cost of car ownership.

The CEO has previously discussed how he believes cars will not be owned by individuals in the future and more fleet management will be required to make sure those in charge of a vehicle are driving responsibly. A lot depends on whether you share the same vision.

**AOB**

KRO was listed on the JSE today and traded up to $45 per share - the Nasdaq listing trading currently around $32 at the time of writing this.

I would be interested to read your comments and feedback.

mutq93,,investing,post,1618934752,"Venmo just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's handNew York (CNN Business) Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have gone increasingly mainstream, but Tuesday's announcement that Venmo is adding crypto support just put crypto access in the palm of everyone's hand.

Venmo, which is owned by PayPal (PYPL), said its more than 70 million customers can buy bitcoin [and other coins] for as little as $1.

Cryptocurrency can often feel confusing and inaccessible to newbies, so Venmo will offer in-app guides and videos to help answer commonly asked questions and share information about the world of crypto.

The payment company hopes that this new initiative ""demystifies some of the common questions and misconceptions that consumers may have,"" Darrell Esch, senior vice president and general manager at Venmo, said in a statement.

More than 30% of Venmo customers have already started purchasing cryptocurrency or equities, according to the payments company. And 20% of those customers started doing so during the pandemic.

Last week, crypto enthusiasm soared as trading platform Coinbase went public at a valuation of $86 billion... Cryptocurrency backers have spent years insisting that bitcoin and other digital coins could revolutionize the world of finance. That hasn't happened yet, but Venmo's announcement is another example of how crypto is creeping ever closer toward mainstream acceptance.

Venmo is joining a list of other companies that recently began recognizing or accepting cryptocurrencies. Tesla has started accepting bitcoin payments for its cars and now holds some of the digital currency on its balance sheet. Payment processors including Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are trying to streamline crypto payments on their networks. Goldman Sachs will reportedly soon offer its private wealth management clients avenues to invest in bitcoin and other digital currencies. And Morgan Stanley announced that it will offer its wealthy clients access to bitcoin funds.

mw7vx7,,investing,post,1619106938,"General Partner at Initialized Capital Alda Leu Dennis speaks on investing advice from Garry Tan, why VC funding is gender-biased, and why funding for women-led startups fell during the pandemic.While male founders have consistently gotten more VC funding, the pandemic wasn’t kind to women-led startups, who received even less money from VCs in 2020. Alda Leu Dennis, a general partner at Initialized Capital, says it’s in part because of the lack of women VCs. 

In 2020, VC funding for all-female founding teams fell to 2.4%, a drop from the all-time high of 3.4% the year before, according to Crunchbase. Dennis, meanwhile, is investing in startups that could narrow the gender gap, many of which are FamTech (family tech) companies, designed to improve family life — something many of us have gotten plenty of during lockdown.

Before Initialized, Dennis was a managing partner at 137 Ventures, investing in startups like Wish, Coupang, and CourseHero. She broke into venture capital by way of law (with a stint as a CEO), serving as general counsel at Founders Fund, and assistant general counsel at Clarium Capital Management, working with Peter Thiel.

mv2u08,,investing,post,1618959805,"The belle of the ball? Bidding war begins as Canadian National jumps in with $34B offer for Kansas City Southern ($KSU)After last month's big news of [Canadian Pacific's ~$25B acquisition of Kansas City Southern](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma15h0/major_railroad_merger_canadian_pacific_is_buying/), a spanner has been thrown into the works as competitor Canadian National has come in with a better bid. Canadian National came out with the [details of the offer today](https://www.cn.ca/en/news/2021/04/cn-makes-superior-proposal-to-combine-with-kansas-city-southern/), which include $200 cash and 1.059 $CNI shares for each $KSU share, valuing $KSU at just about $325 as of market open. (This compares to CP's previous offer of $90 and .489 CP shares or about $275 for each $KSU share at time of offer.)

This new bid sets up a big potential struggle for the last major railroad outside the big 6. KCS would have to pay a $700M breakup fee to CP in order to accept another deal, but the offer from CN is significantly better. Both deals would still be subject to STB approval, which is uncertain, and CN may have an even harder time getting approval given some overlap with the existing KCS network.

Canadian Pacific has already [fired back in a statement](https://www.railwayage.com/freight/cn-counters-cpkc-with-a-superior-proposal/?RAchannel=regulatory):

> “CN’s proposal is massively complex and likely to fail,” CP said, guns blazing in a press release issued late on April 20. “[It] would create the third-largest Class I railroad [after UP and BNSF] and destabilize the competitive balance in the North American rail industry. The only combination involving KCS that is clearly in the public interest is the one that Canadian Pacific has proposed, which has already garnered support from more than 400 shippers and other stakeholders. While remaining the smallest of the six U.S. Class I railroads by revenue, a combination [of] CP and KCS creates stronger single-line competition against existing Class I routes.

KCS shareholders are likely feeling like the belle of the ball with multiple bidders now in the mix and the lurking potential of a bid from Union Pacific or even Berkshire Hathaway (BNSF). At minimum CP would likely have to improve their offer in order to see it accepted. $KSU was up 15% to $295.50 at the end of today's trading.","['KSU', 'BLL', 'BRK.B', 'UNP']"

muxxha,,investing,post,1618945936,"I think Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and ArchegosTo understand what’s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill’s insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I’m guessing it’s directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don’t have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I’ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse’s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don’t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won’t be pretty either way.

Now let’s talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don’t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos’s TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn’t justify the hit Credit Suisse’s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash – they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn’t have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn’t enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I’m confident I’m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. There are too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to act as a catalyst for more bad news, and the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market’s behavior over the past several days, I think it’s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I’m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss’s interaction with Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS’s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I’m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.

Edit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I won't tell you what to think, but I do want to give my personal thoughts. I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of ""adjusted"" and ""excluding significant items"" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a ton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term. This is a play that I believe will likely take several years to pay off.","['GS', 'MS', 'DISCA', 'VIAC']"

We did get disappointing earnings from United Airlines yesterday and this is of course a proxy for the pandemic reopening trade. Almost all other major earnings reports have beaten estimates.

At the time of this writing, more reports came in with J&J beating on earnings and revenues. We’re due to hear from a bunch of other blue chips today, including Lockheed Martin, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and Netflix.

Nothing in terms of economic data releases today, but we are getting a bit of a surge in daily reported COVID cases in the U.S. that could be weighing on markets as well.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/mr2m8u/coinbase_deep_dive_diligence_part_1_of_2/) included qualitative thoughts. Part 2 includes my quantitative thoughts. Almost all of the data I provide here comes from the company’s [S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373?cik=1679788), website, [latest Q1 2021 report](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788), and [Meritech’s breakdown of Coinbase’s S-1.](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/coinbase-ipo-s-1-breakdown#:~:text=Coinbase%2C%20the%20leading%20digital%20currency,their%20S%2D1%20last%20week.&text=The%20company%20is%20riding%20a,for%20when%20they%20start%20trading)

**Overview of Q1 2021 Results**

* I’ve spread Coinbase’s key financial results and metrics over the past 9 quarters [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzNvBZZVoAgWzDW?format=png&name=large) and all you really need to do is look at the last column to see the insane growth Coinbase has experienced in the past quarter
* To highlight a few of the most impressive stats from Q1 2021 alone:
   * **$1.8BN in revenue** \- 208% growth vs. Q4 2020 and almost equivalent to all of 2019-2020 revenue **combined**
   * **$1.1BN in EBITDA** (63% EBITDA margin) and **$765M in net income** (43% net income margin) - highly profitable business
   * $223BN assets held on Coinbase / $1.9TN crypto market cap = **11% market share (share has been growing from 5% in 2019**
   * **56 million verified users -** 148% increase vs. Q4 2020
   * **6.1 million monthly transacting users** \- 118% increase vs. Q4 2020
* In short, Coinbase couldn’t have picked a better time to go public given its business is firing on all cylinders

[**S-1 Income statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=35)

* Already went through revenue, EBITDA, and net income above so won’t go into those numbers in this section and instead here are some interesting details about how Coinbase operates:
   * Only 5% of total revenue comes from **institutional trading** vs. 90% from **retail** ([source](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg))
      * As you can see from this [chart](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc425026023788b31aa90_Retail%20vs%20Inst%20Trading%20Volume.jpg), institutional trading which is in orange is increasingly taking up a larger portion of trading activity, but since the fees are much less, institutions aren’t as big of a revenue driver for the company
   * As an investor, you also want to pay attention to Coinbase’s [subscription and services revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db9c3d6043b53ffce04e5_Net%20Revenue%20Build.jpg) which is **growing quickly but only represents 4% of revenue**
      * These revenue streams are important because they aren’t as reliant on the volatile crypto market
   * Another key component of revenue you’ll want to keep track of is **Coinbase’s fees** which is known to be one of the highest amongst all crypto exchanges. There is a [slight downward trend](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc1ba90bfb1afb0dec799_Implied%20Take%20Rate.jpg) which may continue over time as competition intensifies
   * Something I personally find most impressive is that only **4% of revenue was spent on sales & marketing**. The company states that [90% of its retail users came through word of mouth](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021005373/1?cik=1679788&hl=450165:450601&hl_id=vkh5d_8u5) which just means customers are freely marketing for the company
* So in sum, Coinbase’s income statement looks really great but it’s important to note that the company is highly reliant on a volatile crypto market which you can see much more clearly [if you look at the quarterly figures](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc5db0260230460324f6a_Transaction%20Revenua%20and%20Trading%20Volume.jpg)
   * The blue bars represent transaction revenue which represents 96% of Coinbase’s revenue. The orange line represents trading volume and you can see a very strong correlation between these two metrics
* This is made even more clear as you go down the income statement looking at [this visual](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dbcb3c622e2441c22e876_GAAP%20Operating%20Margins%20and%20Adj%20EBITDA.jpg). The blue bars here represent Coinbase’s operating income while the orange and gray lines represent EBIT and EBITDA margins respectively and the numbers are all over the place
* **Main takeaway:** Coinbase’s reliance on the crypto market is good when things are up and bad when things go down and this represents the biggest risk of investing in Coinbase

[**S-1 Cash Flow Statement Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=38)

* Coinbase’s 2020 cash from operations is $3BN and subtracting out capital expenditures of $9.9 million leave us with **a little less than $3BN in free cash flow** which sounds pretty outstanding (but there’s a catch):
   * Custodial funds are basically **cash deposits customers are holding** on Coinbase’s platforms and the company is **restricted** form using this cash
   * This means that custodial funds actually **inflate** Coinbase’s cash from operations since it’s not really cash that Coinbase is generating from its business and its really owned by their customers
   * As a result, Coinbase’s cash from operations for 2020 is closer to **$300 million** and their free cash flow is closer to **$285 million** which is still solid but nowhere near the $3 billion mentioned above
* Beyond that, nothing stands out on the cash flow statement and the figures probably look even better now given Q1 2021 figures
* Definitions in case it’s helpful: 
   * **Cash from operations** represents the cash generated from the core operational part of the business which for Coinbase mainly means operating its trading platforms, paying employees, suppliers, and etc.
   * **Free cash flow** is the cash the company generates that they are “free” to do whatever they want with, which could mean investing back into the business, paying down debt, or paying investors via dividends

[**S-1 Balance Sheet Overview**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006850/1?cik=1679788&table=34)

* With **$1BN in cash and no debt,** Coinbase is in a very solid position
   * Digging in a little more, you do see assets a bit inflated due to the custodial funds but that’s also balanced on the liability section
* Two other unique line item worths mentioning are the **crypto assets held vs. the crypto asset borrowings** which are interrelated and offset one another
* The last thing I want to mention is that **Coinbase’s PP&E is only $50 million** which is tiny compared to the company’s scale
   * Personally as an investor, I want to see these kind of asset-light companies because physical PP&E often depreciates so rapidly over time and is costly to manage

**Coinbase Valuation**

* The hard thing about valuing Coinbase is that the company’s results are so tied to the cryptocurrency market, which as you probably know is incredibly volatile, so I’ll do my best to frame valuation with some data / numbers, but treat them all as rough estimations
* With Q1 2021 revenue at $1.8BN, taking a simple annual run rate of $1.8BN x 4 = **$7.2BN in 2021 expected revenue,** which represents **464% year over year growth** vs. 2020
* Comparing against some of the [fastest growing software companies in the world](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabc93f6a-762b-4ac3-881e-d02078acff4c_472x288.png), no company comes close to Coinbase’s revenue growth BUT these companies of course have much more predictable business models while Coinbase’s revenue growth could easily go negative any given quarter or year
* As a result, I think it’s fair to apply a 9-11x 2021 sales multiple to Coinbase which I think is more on the conservative side and credits Coinbase for its growth while also recognizes the company’s volatility and potential downside
   * 9 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $65BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $64BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$250 / share**
   * 11 x $7.2BN 2021 revenue = $82BN enterprise value - $1BN net debt = $81BN equity value / 261mm fully diluted shares = **$313 / share**
* **Thus, I get to a range of $250 - $313 per share for Coinbase** with room for a lot of upside if the crypto market keeps growing and a lot of downside if the crypto market faces a significant correction

**What I’m Doing**

* I’d be comfortable buying Coinbase at **$250-$313 as a small portion of my portfolio (\~5% max)** as I think that it's a reasonably fair value for the company given the potential for a lot of upside in the future if the crypto market grows exponentially as it has been
   * I know there’s a lot of debate about buying Coinbase stock vs. Bitcoin or crypto as pure play investments; personally, I don’t see much harm in betting on both, especially for my Roth IRA which obviously I can’t buy crypto in
* That said, I do think the crypto market at the moment is in a bubble (I experienced the 2017/2018 crypto crash and see a lot of similarities but this is just **pure personal speculation**), so would plan to at max buy 50% of my total ideal position and dollar cost average down if and when the opportunity arises

**TLDR:** In my view, Coinbase is a good buy for the right price (ideally in the $200s for me). Financials look outstanding based on 2020-2021 figures released thus far but the company's volatility and dependence on the crypto market makes it a tricky buy. I wouldn't blame anyone for being super bearish or bullish on the stock. Since I'm bullish on crypto in the long-run, I'm cautiously bullish on Coinbase as well.",
mu1z70,gv4yjrj,investing,comment,1618872072,"Crypto is here for the long term, but right now the ""hype"" around it is an unsustainable speculative mania. Coinbase's revenue growth will slow accordingly if crypto prices crash, or if the crypto-mania dies out.

Anyways, still great company, but the risks are massive, especially for it's 100 billion valuation.",
mu1z70,gv3e37x,investing,comment,1618847585,"Nice fundamentals.   I think COIN is probably the most compelling IPO of 2021 and the stock price could double more easily than a lot of other tickers out there.     

One question is how the stock will contend with the approval of a BTC ETF, if this occurs.   Right now, many COIN buyers want exposure to the crypto sector, but with the investor protections of a publicly traded equity.  A natural place for it is in a Roth IRA.   But, if a BTC ETF is approved (and that's a big if) wouldn't you rather have that instead?

An attractive feature of COIN's ""we sell shovels in this gold rush"" investment thesis is that buying it means you don't have to pick a winner in the crypto boom.  If BTC ends up #1, you make money, but you also make money if it's ETH, or if it's one of the touted Ethereum killers (if a coin they don't have like Solana really takes off, they will add it).

As you can see, Covid has  a big negative impact  on their International business.

&#x200B;

 After watching their fundamentals and revenue, i though, that maybe this is a value play, because  their revenue  deterioration may associated with COVID only. 

I created DCF  model to be sure. Even in a bad scenario with CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate)  for their FCFF (-3,85%) for the upcoming 5 years and  WACC 9% ) their intrinsic  value  is about **3 $ per share, with current price 1,66 $ per share.**

Seems like no brainer, but i think that this is a value trap right here and i will try to explain my thoughts. Always ask yourself **Why is this stock being sold at this price?** 

I didnt see any drivers for this stock and why their price should goes up. Their main business heavily  depends on international retailers, E-commerce share of a retail market will only grow( especially in Brazil and China, that have 35% and 8,9% of their international revenue accordingly), and revenue of SPAR Group will only shrink over time because of that, slowly but surely.  I don’t think that a lot of people will find desire to buy this stock. 

Yes, its a good company with really strong fundamentals right now and with intrinsic value about 3$ per share, but i will not buy it. Maybe i missing something,  will be grateful if you show me what.",

mtjvlt,,investing,post,1618774981,"Vanguard to launch UK Personal Financial Planning[Vanguard slashes the price of financial advice](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9482093/Vanguard-slashes-price-financial-advice.html)

US investment giant Vanguard aims to shake up the financial advice market with the launch of a cut-price service tomorrow.

Already known for low fees for its funds, which track markets rather than using skilled managers to pick investments, Vanguard will charge 0.79 per cent a year for financial advice – including the cost of the investment funds and platform fee.

The move could send shockwaves through an industry where the fees of fund managers and financial advisers often add up to more than double this.

Traditional financial advisers charge an initial fee of 2.4 per cent, followed by 1.9 per cent a year in fund and advice costs on average, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Vanguard, the world's second largest asset manager, could also grab billions of pounds in business from the estimated nine out of ten people who do not currently get any financial advice – often because they fear they can't afford it.

Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard Europe, says: 'For many investors the cost of advice is a barrier – it is not uncommon to see total fund management and advice costs of more than 2 per cent.'

Vanguard's service will not be as comprehensive as offered by independent financial advisers.

For example, its advice does not cover inheritance tax planning, property and other assets and insurance products.

It also does not enable savers to buy funds aside from its own.

For savers with complex finances, specific goals, or who want plenty of support, an independent financial adviser could still be the best solution. But for savers with straightforward finances, the Vanguard service could be ample.

This is not the first time Vanguard has thrown down the gauntlet to the financial industry with rock-bottom prices.

In 2017, it launched an online investment service costing just 0.15 per cent a year – considerably cheaper than the incumbents.

And last year it added a self-invested personal pension charging 0.15 per cent a year – capped at £375. By comparison, wealth manager Hargreaves Lansdown charges up to 0.45 per cent a year.

Vanguard hopes its new 'personal financial planning' service will appeal especially to people coming up to retirement and who want to turn savings into a secure income for their old age.

It will offer advice on how to achieve retirement targets by exploring a range of tax-efficient options. This will be particularly important for savers who risk breaching the pension saving lifetime allowance of £1,073,100.

Any money above this level taken as income incurs an extra 25 per cent charge and taken as a lump sum is taxed at 55 per cent.

Hagerty says: 'We see the lifetime allowance as something that could become a factor for many people – and we aim to provide support so clients are able to consider other tax-efficient options, such as individual savings accounts.'

Initially the service will only be open to people with at least £50,000 to invest and this money will have to be put into Vanguard's range of funds.

Those with savings of £50,000 to £100,000 will be offered a 'digital financial planning experience'.

They will also be able to talk through the details and their aims with an adviser over the phone.

Savers with more than £100,000 can have video-based conversations as well as accessing phone support.

Meanwhile those with more than £750,000 invested will get their own financial planner, who will also be able to offer face-to-face financial advice.

Hagerty says: 'Financial advice will be offered by real people – not robots. But once advisers have discussed retirement targets with clients, they will use technology to help manage a portfolio.'


Vanguard will use back office technology to set off alerts when it is time for a customer to move their money into different accounts or receive fresh advice. 

These alerts will be triggered at points that customers have agreed in advance with advisers. They could include, for example, when a customer hits an investment goal, or needs to change the level of risk of their investments as they move closer to retirement.

Advice will not cover non-Vanguard-branded investments, though these could still be taken into account when coming up with a financial plan.

Vanguard offers more than 75 funds to choose from, which track indices such as the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 100.

Hagerty says Vanguard is not trying to take money from independent financial advisers, as they play a vital role in the market.

Yet these advisers might still have plenty to fear – with Vanguard calculating that its low-cost model means an investor with a £250,000 lump sum could save more than £190,000 over 25 years if they pay 0.79 per cent a year in total charges for fund management and advice rather than 2.4 per cent of their investment upfront and 1.9 per cent a year thereafter. This is based on a projected return of 5 per cent a year.

Hagerty adds: 'With potential savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds, you may ask yourself whether paying for expensive managed funds and financial advice offers value for money.'

Most independent financial advisers charge an annual fee calculated as a percentage of your investments, but some charge an hourly rate, generally about £150 an hour.

New player Bancroft Wealth offers financial advice for a competitive flat fee of £500 a year.

Jeremy Fawcett, founder of the consultancy Platforum, believes the new Vanguard service could steal customers from existing so-called robo-adviser services, such as Nutmeg, as well as DIY investment broker services that offer advice arms, such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity.

Nutmeg charges 0.99 per cent a year for managing funds, but requires a one-off £575 for 'personalised planning and advice'.

Hargreaves Lansdown charges an initial 1 per cent for 'investment advice' on the first £1 million you have with it, with a minimum charge of £495 if you receive advice by phone.

Ongoing financial advice costs 0.365 per cent a year. The fees are separate from any fund charges.

Fidelity offers a 'Wealth Management' investment advice service charging 1 per cent of the amount to be managed and 0.5 per cent a year for a review. This levy is separate from any fund charges.",

mt2tfk,,investing,post,1618706696,"Investing Styles Part 1: Jack Bogle and Common Sense InvestingI wanted to write a series of posts regarding different investment styles, the portfolio allocations suggested by the styles, and the assumptions and hidden factors underlying each style. For my first post I will start with the most boomer, r/investing, bogleheads investing style originating from followers of Jack Bogle the founder of Vanguard.

Jack Bogle, our savior, taught us all a sure-fire way to compounding wealth, retirement, and financial freedom: buy Vanguard stock and bond ETFs and then tell everyone you know about the dangers of paying 75bps to ARK funds because of compound interest.

Who am I to question historical 6-7% inflation adjusted returns in the S&P500? As countless threads on r/personalfinance, r/investing, and any of the financial independence subreddits have explained, if you just buy VTSAX in your 401K and IRA you will be rich eventually because Einstein says the most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

The first bit of these threads that piss me off are the advocates for full portfolio allocation to US stocks. When you go “Fuck it, 100% stocks” you lose the only free lunch available which is diversification. Jack Bogle knew this and also recommended an allocation to bonds. The idea is that bonds and stocks are not correlated and so by combining the two assets you can achieve a return without as much variance. But when US stocks have been bull running for over a decade it’s hard to accept some historically lower variance return, so there’s a recency bias for advocating higher percentage allocations to stocks.

The reason that two uncorrelated assets one with higher mean returns (stocks) and one with lower mean returns (bonds) make sense to hold in a portfolio is because you don’t just care about mean return of the portfolio you also want low variance because higher variance means larger drawdowns which reduce compounding growth. Thus we are striving to be both mean and variance optimizers with our portfolios. I will dive deeper into mean-variance optimization and Markowitz portfolio theory when I cover Ray Dalio and risk-parity investing, but for now just remember more variance bad.

So if we realize there’s a recency bias among the gurus of r/investing and allocate to both VTSAX and VBTLX are we good? The answer is maybe, if we are in a falling rate environment and the uncorrelation of stocks and bonds holds then that is very likely a good steady compounding portfolio. If you allocate in this way you are making a bet on the correlations of stocks and bonds, and a bet on the macro environment. Recently stocks and bonds have had correlated moves and this is not a clear bet just because it has generally held to be true over the past several decades.

If you don’t want to take a view on the correlations of stocks and bonds going forward then you need a more complex portfolio that works in a variety of macro environments. In the next installment I will cover Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio as an overview of risk-parity strategies which will attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Bogle strategy but will still have its own shortcomings.

Hopefully this wasn’t too boring a post, I plan to cover more active investment styles like George Soros in future installments but wanted to start with the passive popular styles since I see it the most often.",['SPGI']

For exposure that better matches GDP hold 1.37x VWO for every VTMy portfolio exclusively consists of Vanguard Total World Stock ETFs (VT and VWRL). I specifically invest in those because they give exposure to the world, instead of ETFs with a focus on the US, like VTI and VOO.

Or so I thought...

[VT has a market allocation of 57.1% to US and only 4.5% to China.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vt)

[To adjust for this you can buy an ETF with a focus on China, e.g. VWO.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo)

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

In case that isn't clear enough, I would assume that the average revenue exposure of European public companies to China is >15%. I would assume >10% for US. Those revenues contribute to China GDP.

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this). If you then want to take the additional step of being overweight China equities broadly, something like VWO doesn't sound crazy.  And that step is an interesting debatable topic.",
msaeih,,investing,post,1618600826,"Next week, the US cannabis industry is nearing its first major federal legislation milestone of the year. SAFE Act[**Marijuana Banking Bill Expected To Get A House Floor Vote Next Week, Sponsor’s Office Says**](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-banking-bill-expected-to-get-a-house-floor-vote-next-week-sponsors-office-says/)

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",['ED']

msaeih,gusgny2,investing,comment,1618620995,"I'm heavy in US Cannabis and my heaviest position is in Cresco. Just want to drop a little fundamental analysis here for you guys and expand on SAFE further. 

Bullish Arguments First: 

Currently, the Big 4 MSO's that you mentioned above are trading at a P/S ratio of near or about 7. Meaning their market caps are about 7x their 2020 Revenues. Cresco, specifically, is 6.88 P/S. To compare, CGC and APHA have a P/S of 26 and 9, respectively. MNST is a Consumer Packaged Good [CPG] that trades at about 11 P/S, although that's not a perfect comparison. I consider Cannabis a mix between Agriculture and CPG, so I chose MNST for a comparison with a more mature growth company. Now, a P/S near 7 isn't that crazy of a discount, since that's what more mature growth companies are trading near. However, that's not considering the exponential growth that each state brings in terms of sales. Each state has a TAM boost of maybe near 1-2 Billion. Each MSO had Year over Year growths of over 100% in sales. And the estimates for 2021 and 2022 remain over 100%. For example, Cresco has a 2022 estimated P/S of **2.5**. Meaning the stock price should 3-4 x to catch up to the 2022 P/S expectation. The estimates are fairly conservative, because they don't consider that the MSO's could potentially reach scale in NJ, NY, and other states that just legalized recreational cannabis. They also aren't fully considering the acquisitions being made and how they could boost revenues and the increased demand in states like Illinois (Did you see those sales numbers?! March had the highest sales OF ALL TIME). 

Talking about acquisitions, it helps lead me into my next point. The MSO's have been incredibly successful, but they've essentially had one arm tied behind their backs. They are forced to trade in Canadian markets and over the counter so their equity raises for acquisitions are heavily handicapped. They are also taxed heavy because Cannabis is linked to Section 280E. Not to mention, they don't even have access to banking yet, which is what SAFE will help with. Literally, they have cash block rooms for the IRS to collect taxes. There are a fair amount of headwinds they are running into, but they are still growing an incredible amount; not to mention that all the Big 4 are already generating positive EBITDA. I use EBITDA because of the Section 280 and federal handicaps they run up against.  None of the big Canadian players are generating positive EBITDA yet, for comparison, and they don't have to worry about the same federal headwinds. The problem, in my opinion, with the Canadians is Canada is one country, with population roughly equal to CA or TX, but with the entire US's worth of competition; there's also no limit on supply of Cannabis. Basic supply and demand, but more supply, less pricing power and lower the margins. The US limits licenses for legalized states so supply is topped. Illinois has the best blueprint, in my opinion, and they are being called the Silicon Valley of Weed. Just SAFE passing and getting off of [280E](https://mjbizdaily.com/how-irs-tries-to-collect-taxes-from-marijuana-companies-through-280e/) will create a massive earnings gap fill (earnings will legit near double). 

[Now what does SAFE do for us?](https://thedalesreport.com/cannabis/would-safe-banking-allow-msos-to-uplist-onto-major-u-s-exchanges-the-experts-weigh-in/) We already know it will pass House next week. We just need the 10 votes in Senate. There are a lot of different viewpoints on SAFE, but the most bullish is if it can help sway the US exchanges to allow for uplisting. Uplisting is the #1 catalyst we should look out for. This opens the door for institutions, ETF's, other fundies, even robinhooders to buy the stock. Right now I think most of them are buying the Canadians instead, which don't have real growth prospects in the US. They can't enter the US THC market and remain listed because it's illegal federally. So while they are doing their thing in Canada, the US MSO's are growing and scaling in key states. When it's federally legal, Canadians might try to enter, but they won't have the time or the equity to scale and compete. It sucks because they had to learn all the lessons the hard way, and now, the US names learned from their mistakes AND they get to keep the Canadians out while they grow and reach scale. It's actually quite fortunate for them the way it worked out. If Cannabis was legalized federally too quickly, the Canadians could have just used their sheer market cap to bully and acquire the US MSO's. 

I can go on all night, but I've spent a fair amount of time writing this up already. Let's briefly discuss the bearish viewpoints.

1) Congress. They could hold up legislation for Cannabis. Although SAFE is one that we should expect in 2021, decriminalization and federal legalization will take time. SAFE doesn't guarantee uplisting, but helps the % chance it can happen in 2021. Today there was news of a federal Bill that allows Veterans to carry legal medical Cannabis across illegal state lines. That's a pretty good start, if it can pass. 

2) Margin compressions. As the market for US Cannabis matures, companies will experience margin compression. Especially as more licenses are distributed. This probably doesn't happen for many years or until growth stales. 

3) ??? I'm sure there are more.

msnd53,guva6w4,investing,comment,1618676032,"I was just having lazy afternoon today thinking about random stuff. I was thinking how in 2018 everyone was pessimistic about markets because equities were very expensive (by 2018 standards) and companies were loaded with debt. Also growth was slowing down and major companies were reporting lower earnings. Hard to believe but people were worried about Apple as it was selling less iPhones year over year. I remember we had quite a big crash in 2018 but then China saved us. Literally China saved out butts and prevented recession. Then things went as they did afterwards people were again complaining about how equities were very expensive and growth was slowing. There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that. This is very interesting and I'm so interested to see where this will end up.",['AAPL']

&#x200B;

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

msadak,,investing,post,1618600726,"AST Spacemobile ($ASTS), Lynk, and Apple all will be competing for the lucrative $40B mobile to satellite marketFull disclosure: I have a small position in $ASTS and warrant $ASTSW. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to share some info on $ASTS (AST Spacemobile) to save potential retail investors time when they do their DD. There is this idea of ""20-100x Return Or 100% Loss"" associated with $ASTS floating around, but AST Spacemobile is no $NKLA. The technology was proven to work by AST and again by Lynk. Apple is diving in this as well. AST Spacemobile the real deal with over 1000 patents, extensive satellite expertise particularly their CEO, and their own majority owned satellite subsidiarity Nanoavionics and is already cash flow positive. AST Spacemobile itself has no debt.

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['AMT', 'MS', 'DISH', 'AAPL', 'TWTR']"

I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

mru1gk,,investing,post,1618540606,"There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock marketHedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['TSLA', 'DE']"

mrudu8,gupbkqa,investing,comment,1618561910,"I'm in ABML myself. I've had my eye on Li-Cycle and at one point had a position but since sold. Someone contacted them and was told they capture 95% of extracted materials which isn't bad but it's on par with the smelting that Redwood Materials does. ABML is close to establishing their pilot plant but they already have a closed loop system that extracts 99%+ of materials. It's also a proven and BASF award winner / established partnership (they continue to use their Facilities in the US). 

Make no mistake I think you can't go wrong with investing a small portion into either stock. Both are highly speculative but that's what you get with an industry that's in it's infancy and penny stock / SPACs. I love these as a shovel play.

myztnx,,StockMarket,post,1619449740,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.

https://preview.redd.it/n790ugjr9jv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=07845e5d4b41a4877dd6cd180ae1faa450adfc46

For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation 

b. One month after recommendation 

c. One quarter after recommendation 

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/k2lc2u1t9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbb6b197286b47782ede7f068f6648eacf492ae

Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

https://preview.redd.it/y39cv6iu9jv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e24eec21c5018c01febdcdc234136935a0a01b6

 Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)

**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** 

https://preview.redd.it/5cx0ov1x9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=50549713d2ae8696b3012add7dbc2fe68ddad8a0

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains. 

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?** 

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:** 

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired. 

**Conclusion:** 

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

**Week of 4/26/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/26/21 at 4185.03, above the previous close of 4180.05 on Friday 4/23/21.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

myvlah,,StockMarket,post,1619436808,"8 Reasons to invest in WELL Health Technologies8 Reasons
WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) Could Be the Healthtech Play of the Future

1
Multi-channel Capability: With healthcare clinics, EMR services, telehealth offerings, digital apps, and more, the company is truly multi-channel, and omni-channel in nature – able to offer both in-person and digital solutions to patients, healthcare professionals, and clinics. This allows the company to not only benefit from all aspects of the healthcare industry, but also provides defensive diversification qualities.

2
Track Record of Accretive Acquisitions: WELL Health (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) has a solid track record of buying profit-generating companies that can continually add value to its bottom line – all with carefully-controlled shareholder dilution. For instance, due to its acquisition of CRH Health, it is expected to experience 120% accretion to revenue and 800% accretion to EBITDA on a per share basis. However, shareholder dilution was limited to a mere 17%.

3
Value-Boosting Synergies Within Business Lines: Post-acquisition, the company also has multiple opportunities to add further value to its acquisitions via internal synergies within its business lines. For example, the company is planning to cross-sell its digital services to CRH Health’s network of over 3,000 Gastroenterologist physicians, which are currently generally digitally underserved.

4
Rapid Acquisition and Growth Strategy: Within the first three months of 2021 alone, WELL Health (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) has already announced six acquisitions – one of which is a major US player. The company also has another 10 signed letters of intent that could add C$100+ million to annual revenues. Further, recent acquisition CRH Medical is itself a proven M&A player with a track record of 32 acquisitions and over 500 active deal targets.

5
Strong Investor Base: Multi-billionaire Li Ka-shing is a strategic investor in the company, among other institutional investors such as Manulife, CI Investments, Sentry Investments, Iconiq Capital, Fiera Capital, and the PenderFund Capital. Li Ka-shing and his partner personally led a C$302.5 million equity raise for the CRH Medical acquisition with their own investment of C$100M at an unprecedented 25% premium to market (based on the 5 day VWAP before announcement) – the additional C$202.5M came from the other institutional investors at the same premium.

6
Well Funded With a Strong Balance Sheet: WELL Health (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) boasts C$87 million in cash as at end-2020 – with zero debt. Only recently did the company take on some debt as part of the CRH Medical acquisition. However, even said debt facility was obtained at highly cost-effective rates of between 1.5% to 3.25% depending on leverage ratios.

7
Future US IPO Listing: The company’s targeted US IPO in late 2021 will provide an additional cash infusion that it can use to turbocharge its acquisition strategy. Further, analysts also expect a US listing to push the company’s valuation upwards to a level more in line with its peers. WELL is grossly undervalued when compared against US comps.

8
Proven Management Team with Skin in the Game: WELL Health’s (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) management team are all veterans of Tio Networks, a multichannel bill payment processor that was acquired by PayPal for C$304 million in 2017.13 They’re also all heavily invested in the company, with the CEO personally investing approximately C$6 million in company stock – and never having sold a single share or taken a dollar of cash as salary thus far.","['EMR', 'PYPL', 'CI']"

Even though…

Its EBITDA already turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2020, with a 53% revenue growth for the year…

It’s just completed a major acquisition that would add approximately C$175 million in revenues and C$72 million in EBITDA to its earnings…

WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) has 10 signed letters of intent that could add another C$100+ million to its annual revenues by the end of 2021…

And it’s planning a US IPO by the end of the year.



When compared to others in the industry, WELL’s peer group trades at 10x to 20x revenue multiples, while WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) trades at an EV to sales multiple of just 5x.

This means that although the company is far from being a risky early-stage startup company…

It still has plenty of room to grow, particularly as it continues to ramp up its acquisitions…

Which could place WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX:WELL) (OTC:WLYYF) in the perfect risk-reward “sweet spot” for investors…

Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:

&#x200B;

Common bear arguments:

\#1 Old business

\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat

\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult

\#4 No growth

\#5 Slow growth

\#6 Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.

\#7 Not profitable

\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell

\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.

\#10 It’s a SPAC

&#x200B;

\#1) Old business. 

Paysafe’s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Much of Paysafe’s business is in back-end payment processing so most don’t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method” and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Paysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They’ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”, “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.”

Aside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service. 

In preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun & Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.

As Chairman Bill Foley says, ""It’s going to be a land grab…I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate."" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. 

&#x200B;

\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. 

Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe’s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,“a fortress. It’s got a moat… We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise."" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion ""unbanked"" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors

From SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: “To be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“To be a winner in this space, you’re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That’s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we’ve entered.”

&#x200B;

\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. 

Synergistic inorganic growth through M&A is a key pillar of Paysafe’s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” (2, 4)

&#x200B;

\#4) No growth. 

It’s true that Paysafe’s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:

2017: $864 million rev

2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)

2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).

2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)

Unlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, “exited low value referral channels” and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.

Looking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:

—Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)

— Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)

Not claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.

&#x200B;

\#5) Slow growth. 

Going forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe’s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.

Analyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.”

In the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:

1 ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

2 ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""

3 New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

4 ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""

5 ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""

6 ”Delaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March""

7 ""Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%""

8 “Caesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL""

9 “Michigan’s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year”

10 “Ohio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling”

11 “Louisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting”

12 “Path to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear”

13 “NC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools”

14 ""Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization""

15 “Florida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal”

16 “Legal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think“

&#x200B;

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign:

&#x200B;

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Notes:

1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.

2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.

3 As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.

4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

&#x200B;

\#6) Too much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more. 

Paysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity’s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: “One of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe’s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.”

Their 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: “Debt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.” Of the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:

Square: 77.8X

Repay : 8.7X

Fiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X

GPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X

Shift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA

Affirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA

Paysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA

Bill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA

Depending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe’s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they’ll be able to fund M&A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.

&#x200B;

\#7) Not profitable. 

Paysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, “Paysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company’s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.”

These fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:

Repay: -0.67,

Affirm : -2.18,

Nuvei : -1.08,

Paysign : -0.19.

Bill : -0.62,

Shift4 : -0.43

Average EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69

If you read their transcripts and presentations, you’ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They’ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.

&#x200B;

\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. 

The common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it’s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.

Importantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley’s time-tested M&A playbook.

Blackstone itself says (9), “The term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.” With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: “We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.”

In a recent interview Foley said, private equity’s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: “They rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn’t take all their money off the table…All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.”

This trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.”

The PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand his both his M&A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the “The Foley Network” (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity’s massive transactional volume). In a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, “The thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I’m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it’s a great asset.”

But, let's assume these funds do eventually sell a portion of their shares which, given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square’s, but more profitable), would allow index funds to accumulate larger positions. Just as large funds often drive price down to accumulate shares, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and do so via off-market trades, avoiding price slippage. This question is less about real risk than it is about short-term fear, which is ultimately why understanding the context and fundamentals is so critical.

&#x200B;

\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. 

According to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.

Importantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.

Total FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 % 

Blackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 % 

CVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 % 

Other Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 % 

Cannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 % 

PIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 % 

723,734,536 100.0 % 

Below are some examples of the warrant cashless conversion rates per the chart in the S1 (7). Cash redemption is more profitable when commons trade above $18. 

$18 : $6.50

$17 : $6.08 

$16 : $5.57

$15 : $5.05

$14 : $4.54

$13 : $4.04 

&#x200B;

\#10) It’s a SPAC. Maybe the best argument.

Paysafe has been tarred and feathered as a SPAC: guilty until proven innocent. Even after ticker change, Cramer called it a SPAC in the same breath that he said, “There is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.”

It’s a hard moniker to drop. Literally every bear article written on Paysafe has relied on arguing that it was suspect because it was a SPAC, saying things like because Chamath sold Virgin Galactic, Paysafe can't be trusted. By contrast the bull articles that bothered to explore the fundamentals generally came up with $24-25 price targets, usually by comparing to PayPal.

Despite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from the media’s indiscriminate wack-a-SPAC narrative, to forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements without prior notice, to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms. In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of “fake sell walls” and HFS “short ladder attacks” as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. 

I think Paysafe is a 3X from here. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space with notoriously “sticky” customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds are poised to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.

&#x200B;

Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe’s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:

$360 million revenue

$220 million gross profit

$105 million EBITDA

Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund, Inc. (NYSE American: CLM) (the ""Fund"") announced today, contingent upon final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that it has fixed the close of business on April 16, 2021 as the record date (the ""Record Date"") for determination of stockholders entitled to participate in the Fund's 1-for-3 rights offering. The Fund is issuing to its stockholders non-transferable rights entitling the holders to subscribe for an aggregate of 26,029,753 shares of common stock. Each stockholder will receive one non-transferable right for each share of the Fund held as of the Record Date. Fractional Shares will not be issued upon the exercise of the Rights. Accordingly, the number of Rights to be issued to a Stockholder on the Record Date will be rounded up to the nearest whole number of Rights evenly divisible by three.

mz0rby,gvyla2k,StockMarket,comment,1619462582,"I'm not an expert on this, but I believe you will receive 300 rights, 1 for each of your currently held shares. If you so choose, you can then exchange those rights + some cash for more (new) shares of the fund. You will need 3 rights for each new share (the 1-for-3 ratio), and the cash cost will be the greater of 107% of the fund's NAV on May 14, 2021, or 80% of the trading price at the end of the same day.  (Note that you are **not required** to buy more shares. It is entirely your choice.)

&nbsp;

Note that unlike many rights offerings, these rights are **non**-transferable. You can't sell them to someone else; you must either exercise them or lose them when they expire (also occurring May 14).

The offering also states that there is an oversubscription privilege which (in this case) I think says that if you use all of your allotted rights, you may then be allowed to purchase even more of the new shares *if* they are available (i.e., some do not use all of their rights).

&nbsp;

I believe this is correct, but as I said, I am not an expert. If you are still uncertain, I recommend calling your broker.

Not that I'm complaining about seeing green, but I was promised like 7% a year, not 10% in three months. After every dip, it goes up even more. So this is all a little confusing to me. Is it just the ract that stocks have gone up overall due to the pandemic? And will there be like a 10% in the next few months? 

Not asking anyone to predict the future, but I'm just wondering about why this is happening and if it's reasonable to predict a big fall in the future. People who have done this for longer can probably answer why this is happening haha",

myyuj4,,StockMarket,post,1619447078,"The price of ZKIN has grew by impressive 24% in value!
And ZKIN is back at it as since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has grew by impressive 24% in value!

ZKIN was on very thin ice few days ago, but it has managed to to find buying support as we've expected for a while.

Let's not get too optimistic as this is only an oversold bounce and we have no confirmation yet of this going higher.

Still, we think that the inverted head and shoulders pattern on 2h time frame is saying one thing -  ""This is an oversold correction indeed, but I look for trend to stay an uptrend from now on.""

About the price action on 15m time frame.

a)
Last time we've said that the price is headed to $6 area where a resistance will be found.

b)
And the price broke to $6.08 and has formed an ascending triangle breakout formation that has broken up to the upside today.

c)
The price broke out to $6.52, from where a mild correction to $6.15 was seen. As the price found support on 20 EMA, strong uptrend has remained strong and continued breaking into a new local high at $7.04 per share!

As the price stands now, current support is at $6.70 while resistance is at $7 and $7.30.

RSI is calling for a correction as yes, bullish momentum is present but the price has created a new high, while RSI created lower high.

MACD is in a strong buying wave with gains keeping on increasing.

Overall short term trend is a strong uptrend as the price is riding highly above 20 EMA.

Based on this short term outlook, we look for a correction to 20 EMA at $6.40 before any more upside as RSI is suggesting.",['ICE']

mypf0w,,StockMarket,post,1619410862,"Thoughts about 4/26-4/30 and the following weeks aheadThis week is filled with huge news , we have j pow speaking again ,the heavy hitters of the market are about to go report their earnings, and we have a bank stress test.(we also might have joe biden speaking this week if yall know when please comment it )

This week is filled with earnings calls from the biggest companies in the world, I expect them to either barely beat these extremely high expectations or be just under , either or . ( except for amd , they might go to the moon)  Regardless, this week in my opinion will be the last week of any major corrections , after this week we should have a pretty nice bull run as a lot of stocks consolidated at new higher levels last week after 2-3weeks of running(well except the crypto minners... I lost a lot of cash with my options smh)  . To be honest , after that little correction plus the quickie by biden , most stocks tested new levels of support and bounced back .

Im going to assume J pow will say the same thing he has been saying for the last 2 months about not increasing rates and that this inflation we see now is temporary ( ex-lumber). Tbh i really dont see him saying anything that could actually spook the markets.( If you know what he could possibly say to spook the markets please share your thoughts) Its just that , the unemployment data showed a steady push towards full employment by coming in a little higher than expected but not enough to really cause the market to be concerned. The J&J vaccine mini halt will add some extra time b4 75% of the US population will be  vaccinated  ( estimates are end of august with the current rate vaccination is going) . The reason Im saying the 75% thing is because one of top guys from one of the fed banks said that people could expect the start of tapering after 75% of the population had gotten vaccinated , but we will see.

Also , I just had to put the bank stress test on here rq because... Guys this isnt going to cause a damn short squeeze the banks already knew this was coming up , hence they had that massive bond sale . These banks want to pass the stress test and get that a ok to be able to buy back their shares( BAC is buying about 25billion back) .

What are yalls views about this week and May?(May starts next week!!)

robinhood - beginning friendly, easy to use

webull - more detail

fidelity - private owned

schwabb - publicly owned

vanguard - investor owned

At first I thought they all have different types of stocks you can invest?  But now I think they can invest in any stock?  I keep reading all sorts of pros and cons of each

i figured vanguard was the way to go just because its investor owned, but finding it incredibly confusing to look at.  Been looking it up here and seeing fidelity and schwabb is easier to use?  I figure maybe use fidelity then transfer to vanguard in future?  Can you just transfer stock from one platform to another?

Lastly, robinhood and webull seems to be often grouped together

While the other 3 are grouped.

myi5rn,,StockMarket,post,1619386304,"$XL Fleet Technical Analysis and DDAlright folks, here's some DD and Technical Analysis on $XL (XL Fleet). Quick background, as some of you may know, $XL was the target of a short attack by Muddy Waters earlier this month, causing the price to crash nearly 75% from highs. This creates a huge buying opportunity for the new longs who get in during the rock bottom prices. Currently, the short interest on $XL is at its highest since January of this year, which allows for a potential squeeze to fuel the next run.

https://preview.redd.it/1ghfnebb1ev61.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c383c27bf28d75d870ddfc7bfc38bb58b0f4039

I'm a fan of keeping the TA simple and not complicated, this allows for more predictable entries and exits imo. If you look at my chart, you can see that Just recently $XL broke out of its downward flag formation due to back to back positive news via PR. This trend breakout commonly results in a run up and retrace of the prior base level ($21ish in this case, ex: $ROKU, $BBBY, etc)). That's almost 3X (200%+) upside just based on pure technicals. Combined with the possibility of a short squeeze and we could see a pop to $30s or higher.

Now for the DD. The current marketcap for XL Fleet is just $1 billion. They have roughly $408 million in CASH on hand, with literally zero debt. That means they have almost HALF their marketcap in just cash, and can survive for many years at their current spending rate. This basically reduces the possibility of dilution or an offering being raised by XL Fleet and eliminates any bankruptcy concerns. The company itself has been in business since 2008 and has been consistently having sales and growing revenue + profit since inception. They just partnered with Dickinsons Fleet services, which will enable them to grow rapidly while committing to providing service and repair to all their ever growing electrified fleets. The best part about their business is that they are not limiting themselves to fleet electrification, they are also expanding to installing charging stations and fleet data intelligence. Those are two huge industries on their own as you can see by checking Chargepoint and other charging station companies marketcap and revenue. XL Fleet just won a contract to install 1000 charging stations at UBS arena, and if successful, will see many more to contracts like these to come.

The fundamentals combined with the EV industry being a hot topic in this administration will continue to propel the business and see it grow exponentially in the coming months and years. Their customer base includes companies like Verizon, Coca Cola, and many more. If they reach $21, their marketcap will still be just $3 billion in an ever growing speculative sector. I can see the company easily justifying a $5-6 billion marketcap which would put it around $35-42 range.

Overall, I feel like the short attack by Muddy Waters combined with the recent SPAC selloff generated a huge once in a while buying opportunity to get in super cheap on XL Fleet, with limited downside risk and significant upside potential. To me its like getting in $GME at rock bottom. I'm all in.

TLDR: I like the stock. I'm Long 8k shares and May 21 $11 calls.",['WAT']

mygrsr,,StockMarket,post,1619382298,"Big week ahead: What to look for in the marketBiden proposed to double the tax rate for the wealthy, sending FUD throughout the market last week  
[Big week ahead: What to look for in the market - DecentraNews ](https://decentra.news/big-week-ahead-what-to-look-for-in-the-market/)

Under Biden’s proposal, capital gains tax could get as high as 43.4% according to Bloomberg. currently, investors pay a 23.8% top rate on long-term capital gains. Under current law, long-term capital gains are taxed favorably with respect to wages. The wealthy pay a top 37% rate on wage income, for example. The new plan would instead tax capital gains as ordinary income, at a top proposed rate of 39.6%, which would only apply to those with more than $1 million in annual income.  


The thing is, with all the money printing that has been going on lately, and the likelihood of increased inflation in the next months/years, people will have no choice but to put their wealth stocks and other assets. Interest rates are very low, which doesn’t leave many choices to fructify your investments.  


**In the end, big tech will likely decide the fate of the market this week. Last October we bottomed out when big tech had earnings, January we topped when big tech had earnings.**  


April do we top when big tech has earnings? I think it is likely.

That market reaction makes me feel the bill will be DOA. The tax increase is going to affect those of us who are making $1M+ year, and although we can always use our attorneys to find those legal loopholes to avoid those higher taxes, I am concerned that we will have to deal with this pressure for at least the next 3 years.....unless there is a turnover in the House/Senate in 2022. If Trump had had a second term, I believe his tax cuts would have had more ample time for folks to materialize their plans.

First, I would like to share I personally spoke to the CEO today (Friday). I sent an email to Brett in their IR dept asking a few questions. I soon received a phone call from Brett asking if I would like to speak directly with the CEO, Wes Cummins. We set up a 3-way call within 10 minutes. It was truly exceptional they took the time to call me on a Friday afternoon with such short notice. 

DD completed with PPS at $.92 (update: current PPS $ $1.40)

**TLDR:** Short Term PPS conservatively at $3.50-$4.00. Short Term catalysts that will cause PPS to jump… #1 Announcement mining rigs have gone live, which is expected in May. #2: Listing on OTCQB. Application process has started.  #3. PPS has increased steadily all week on heavy consolidation. Heavy Ask Volume all week. Continued breakout inevitable with a significant volume spike.

\*I did confirm with their CEO, over $5million in mining rigs were ordered in early April with an estimated delivery time of 4-6 weeks. Rigs are expected to go live in May. I also got confirmation, there are no short term plans for any dilution!

SOS had a mkt cap of $700 million right after their first 5000 rigs went live. Buying APLD now is getting into a money printing business while its literally building its foundation. IMO, I wouldn't sleep on this one. Its new partnerships with experienced players like Sparkpool and GMR will help expedite their success.

PPS run just getting started. Applied Blockchain: APLD  The company has changed their name to Applied Blockchain. You might see Applied Science Technology when you search the ticker.

First, I would like to share I personally spoke to the CEO today (Friday). I sent an email to Brett in their IR dept asking a few questions. I soon received a phone call from Brett asking if I would like to speak directly with the CEO, Wes Cummins. We set up a 3-way call within 10 minutes. It was truly exceptional they took the time to call me on a Friday afternoon with such short notice. 

DD completed with PPS at $.92 (update: current PPS $ $1.40)

**TLDR:** Short Term PPS conservatively at $3.50-$4.00. Short Term catalysts that will cause PPS to jump… #1 Announcement mining rigs have gone live, which is expected in May. #2: Listing on OTCQB. Application process has started.  #3. PPS has increased steadily all week on heavy consolidation. Heavy Ask Volume all week. Continued breakout inevitable with a significant volume spike.

I sold all the long-term stocks that I had held and put it all into this one penny stock. Needless to say I lost everything. I took a little over a $5000 loss and I’ve lost the 3 years that it took me to save up that money and invest it.

About a month ago I sold all the shares that I had in that company (now worthless) and I’m starting from the bottom again. I’ve got one share of AAPL, MSFT, T, BRK-B, and VZ. I have some etf’s and mutual funds on a watchlist that I want to get back into again once I have more money again.

my2m0d,gvt7uu2,StockMarket,comment,1619353216,"Penny stocks, especially the pink sheets are extremely risky. In fact, a good chunk of them aren't even real companies. Never go all in on one. Never buy the dip. It is basically gambling. There are however a few like rycey however that have value and are legit massive companies. You just need to do the research. 

Best advice I can give is to go for the small wins, don't wait for the big ones. Buy low in undervalued companies and hold. If you did your research, hold strong and wait for the rise. While you wait sell covered calls. This will lower your average cost over time and even if the price never rises you can eventually sell for a profit.",

We went through quite some ups and downs ever since the start of the year, and once again broke off to all time highs.

The past few months seem straight up parabolic/climatic.

The more furious the blow off, the more rapid the correction/pullback.

Can we continue roaring higher without much pullback?

How high can we go before we see a drawn out correction?

Or is it wrong to be expecting such because this is a 'new normal'?

my7pwl,gvtrvsx,StockMarket,comment,1619365060,"I guess someone has to do it so it might as well be me. Here are my two cents ....I am boldly going to predict the following crack-up boom scenario:-

**SP 500 to be above 4500 by YE 2021 AND above 5000 by YE 2022**

Here is why:-

\- There will be a post pandemic boom in consumer spending peaking in 2023-2024 like the roaring 1920s post WW1 and the end of the Spanish Influenza pandemic...

\- The multi-stimulus packages around the world will kick in simultaneously in the 2H 2021 with spending in all infrastructure areas.

\- Asset price/financial inflation will be high and rising... great for stocks and property

\- Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) will be subdued at around 2-2.5%

\- Treasury yields have peaked and will be stable going forward with no inversion of the curve

\- Gold and Silver stabilize in price at current levels

\- Unemployment will continue to fall quickly around the world

\- Company earnings will be strong and and rising

\- Tax rises for most folks will be muted if not postponed until 2023+

\- The China/East Asia growth story will continue to march forward

\- Commodities prices will be strong (oil, lpg, copper, iron ore, coffee, wheat etc...)

\- Global and regional leisure travel will be rising to higher levels than 2019

&#x200B;

Key events to watch that could derail my crack-up boom scenario

\- a virulent Covid-19 strain emerges that vaccines are ineffective against

\- China invades Taiwan

\- the health of the President deteriorates which requires a leadership change/challenge

\- yet another war in the Middle East

&#x200B;

Key signposts to watch out for

\- Inversion of the treasury yield curve

\- Continued sabre rattling by China (like the Sachin Glacier events in 2019/20)

\- Gold spiking

\- Cryptos plunging

\- Iran threatening Israel and Saudi Arabia (again)

1: the first is [faucetcrypto](https://faucetcrypto.com/ref/781142) it allows to earn some coin through shortlink,s ptc ads or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up

2: the second is [dutchy corps](https://autofaucet.dutchycorp.space/?r=france999) that is an autofaucet, it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads and surfing ads. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus

3: the third is [autoclaim](https://autoclaim.in/r/france999) that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw

mxy5cx,,StockMarket,post,1619315229,"VOO vs SPY - Why would someone choose the latter?Let's have a fact-based, rational discussion over these two titans. 

Is it only a matter of brand value and trust on SPY's issuer? (hence the higher price of SPY's shares)

**Facts**:

*Strategies are the same*: Both are indexed to SP500

*Dividend difference is negligible* (2 cents)

On the other side, *ER difference is significant*. SPY's ER is three times more expensive than VOO's. 

In the same way, the *difference in price* cannot be dismissed or overlooked. If you plan to keep investing (or reinvesting for that matter) on a regular basis, this will affect the amount of stock you can buy (assuming the difference will remain unchanged).

**Opinion**:

I do not see a strong case to keep both in my portfolio. I am seriously considering selling off my SPY shares and buy more VOO in exchange.

In terms of trading options, wouldn't SPX be even better than SPY? These options are cash settled (if I'm not mistaken) and I think you even more expirations.

In terms of CC, if you are carefully managing your portfolio, you could apply for higher level of option trading. Buy and hold VOO, and then sell calls on SPY (you need 100*(SPY PRICE / VOO price) shares of VOO per SPY calls. Note, this would require careful management. If you get assigned, you need to sell your VOO to get money buy back the short SPY shares.

When either GME or AMC pop they both pop. Plus all the other shorted stocks the Heggies have. But let's forget any other shorted sock and just focus on 2 stocks, GME & AMC. 

Add up all the shares (shorted to) of GME/AMC.
multiply that amount by the payout amount, this figure can be anything. But just for grins let's use 50k ($50,000)
The result will be the Total payout amount. 

GME/AMC shares X $ payout amount = total dollar amount.

If you use $50k, the amount you get is in the TRILLIONS and TRILLIONS. Much more then the TOTAL value o the United States. That's right, every home, every car, every plane, every business, every bank.

I found a trading strategy that I really like and I am finally profitable with so I wanted to share it with you guys. But first, I want to make it clear that my #1 strategy is to HODL. But since HODL is 100% passive, I want to trade Bitcoin and other cryptos as well. Because I enjoy it, and its profitable for me.

So, my favourite day trading strategy is this:
- Taking profit at 3%
- Having a stop loss at 2%
- Using a 15X leverage (this is risky, so do NOT copy me)
- Using an exchange with super low fees
- Trading primarily Fibonacci golden pocket on smaller time frames

In my +80000% day trading challenge that I am doing on YouTube, I was able to 10X my balance in 2 months. I started with 100 USD and now it is over 1000 USD.

The world has come to a stop and mental health and addiction issues are not only at all time highs, but these issues are also falling through the cracks. The pandemic is increasing the need for mental health and addiction services due to social isolation, loss of income/financial stability and fear (WHO 2020). All of these issues are exacerbating + worsening problems in mental health and addiction (WHO 2020). Don't forget that COVID 19 itself can lead to neurological problems and mental complications such as delirium, agitation, and stroke according to current research.

IN STEPS MINDMED (ticker MMED, MMEDF ---- uplist ticker MNMD on Tuesday April 27th)

Mindmed uplist is happening at a pivotal time in this pandemic.The company focuses its efforts on bringing ""psychedelic treatment to the forefront through research ultimately creating a new toolset for mental health and addiction"" (Mindmed 2021).

MINDMED IS THE FUTURE

Psychedelics have anecdotally been known to help mental health/illness. This company has a large hand in creating the necessary research/trials that will assist widespread adoption of psychedelic treatment for the reduction of anxiety, depression ADHD and addiction. They currently have phase 2a trials with compounds such as psilocybin and LSD.

MINDMED IS A DISRUPTOR!

BIG PHARMA focuses on pumping and pushing pills to mask symptoms. MINDMED offers real solutions for mental health conditions/issues. ""We are currently researching and developing a broad range of compounds with the goal of unlocking new pathways for patients to experiment SUSTAINED mental healing""(Mindmed 2021).

THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY + A GAME CHANGER
For mental health and addiction, especially in these uncertain times.

There will be a major catalyst for price action movement on Tuesday April 27th once it uplists to the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol MNMD. You can get in Monday before uplist with ticker symbol MMED (Canadian), MMEDF (US). It has easily touched $6 in the past.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
> Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
> It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
> As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> # The central bank takes the main stage
> “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
> So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
> There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
> The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
> “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
> Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
> Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
> The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
> “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
> Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
> # Tax hike prospects
> Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
> Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
> Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
> “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
> So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
> David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
> “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
> He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
> “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
> “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
> He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
> Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
> “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

> # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

> As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

> Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

> Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

> # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

> The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

> After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

> The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

> “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

> The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

> # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

> “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

> One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

> After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

> “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

> # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

> It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

> We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

> U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

> A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

> # Dips in Short Supply

> While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

> In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

> Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

> # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

> If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**

> The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

> It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

I’ve been trading for a year an I’m at the 20% annual mark but it would be great to hear about someone doing 50% or better a year consistently. Anyone?

It's relatively easy to get high returns in a 1 off year, when compared to getting those same returns over a long period of time. Furthermore I think last year is a bad year to use as an example, anything could have made over 30% if u bought anywhere near the lows.",
my0fg0,gvt0utf,StockMarket,comment,1619347244,"You’ll need different strategies for different market situations. 20% is a huge target. Better have more money in absolute terms, so that 5-10% makes u a good living. 
If you can, code your strategy and backtest it...",
my0fg0,gvt9b68,StockMarket,comment,1619354275,"This last year a 20% return is nothing. This is not a normal year. Stocks were rebounding from serious lows to highs. I would argue a 20% return in this market is low. With that said, I expect the market to get tougher over the next few years. Many predict a crash. I am not quite that doom and gloom but it is possible. 

I have been doing this daily for 10 plus years and investing for 20. Yes, it is possible to average 20% returns but keep in mind the vast majority of traders never beat the S&P, which is well below the 20% goal. This will be much harder over the next few years. 

With that said, it can be done. The key is to avoid loss. It is harder to make money than it is to lose it. If you can avoid loss it is easier to go up because you aren't constantly fixing losses. For this I sell a lot of covered calls and puts in stable companies I wouldn't mind owning long term. I trade massive runs for stability and reliable income generation. I also don't have to worry about price as much as it is not a direct part of my strategy. This has given me consistent returns well above 20% annually for ten years. Last year I was up 300%. This year I will likely be up 100% or more. So yes, it can be done. You just have to find a strategy that works for you.

Also, don't quit your day job until your portfolio is large enough to retire. Why? If you have to pay yourself, you make poor decisions. You also take away from what gets reinvested which means it is harder to grow. Yes, you can live off of a $100k portfolio, but you can't do both live and grow off of it. To do both I suggest having a minimum of $250k to $500k. This will allow you greater comfort in trading. My portfolio is retirement level and I still work full time so I can reinvest my gains. I will likely do it full time after I pay cash for a house with land in another two years. I need to work long enough that I can do this and still have a healthy cash horde to keep trading successfully.",['SPGI']

Non-qual options do not have capital gains taxes because you never hold them. The time from your beating date to exercise does not count toward capital gains.",

They own Florida Power And Light Company, which is the largest rate-regulated electric utility in the United States. NextEra Energy also owns a competitive clean energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, which, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun and a world leader in battery storage. Through its subsidiaries, the company generates emissions-free electricity from seven commercial nuclear power units in Florida, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin. NextEra Energy is the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization, with a market cap of $148.5 billion.

They pay out dividends every quarter with a yield of 1.93%. Their dividend is deemed very safe by analysts meaning it is unlikely to decrease in the future. NextEra Energy has increased its dividend for the last 25 years with an average growth of 9% per year.

They reported Q4 2020 adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, which beat the consensus estimate of 39 cents by 2.6%. The bottom line was also up 11.1% from 36 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. This year-over-year improvement was owing to the company’s proper execution of its growth plans as well as the expansion of its customer base. NextEra Energy’s operating revenues were $4.395 billion missing the analysts' estimates of $4.94 billion by 11%. Their next earnings report is scheduled for Apr 27, 2021.

The stock currently sits at $78.24 per share. Analysts from UBS target a price of $95.00 per share in the next 12 months with a BUY position. Analysts at Wells Fargo also have a BUY position for NextEra Energy with a price target of $100.00 per share. Out of 10 analysts, 8 have given it a BUY rating and 2 a HOLD rating. Based on analysts' ratings, the forecasted average price of NextEra Energy's stock in the next 12 months is $138.71, an increase of more than 75%.

GEO jumped 7% yesterday, but price of both still looks cheap historically. I think it is still severely undervalued (analysts are saying it’s worth 3X its current value).

I don’t blindly invest in anything I don’t believe in. Most also incorrectly perceive an IPO that goes down in value to be a failure. This is incorrect!!! When the price moves lateral or decreases in the first few days or even weeks, the company has done a fair market valuation, and had achieved the goal of generating capital BACK TO THE COMPANY!!!
That is the objective!! It process the greatest capital capture thus way and fully allows growth.
If the price goes up then all the extra capital is on the public’s hands and actually is a failure of the objective.. while neither scenario is an indication of the future success or failure of the company it does make you pause and query why the price was incorrectly valued in the case where the prices for the ipo goes up..  check into $IMPL

I’ve been setting up my portfolio to basically pump into for the next 10 -15 years and just forget about it, basically low maintenance (with respects to ARKK, I’ll Check quarterly of course). After lots of research, here’s what I’m looking for my portfolio to look like. Let me know if this seems like a good decision or if there’s any improvements or changes I should make. I’ll include 2 different setups with their respective dilemmas. 

(Percentages here are ER’s) 
1. 
VT - 0.08%
AARK - 0.75%
IVV - 0.03%

(Percentages here are amounts held) 
VT - 30%
AARK - 30%
IVV - 40%

2.
VT - 0.08%
AARK - 0.75%
QQQ - 0.20%

(Percentages here are amounts held) 
VT - 40%
AARK - 30%
QQQ - 30%

Does it make sense to have IVV or QQQ if I already have VT? I would think so because IVV is a bit more aggressive in the US as well as QQQ being even more aggressive especially in tech (which I think makes sense for the long run). However I still wanted some sort of international coverage from VT. Curious to any help I could get.",['ARKK']
mxc81q,gvo6mfg,StockMarket,comment,1619261341,"> Does it make sense to have IVV or QQQ if I already have VT

Not really, since VT already contains those holdings. I guess if you wanted to tilt towards large cap/tech then it would make sense to hold those as well, though I'm not sure why you would want to do that. When you say 'aggressive' here you're referring to uncompensated risk that isn't expected to result in higher yields.

Everyone has their own wants/needs when it comes to investing, but FWIW I would do 90/10 VT/ARKK",['ARKK']

mwvt1b,,StockMarket,post,1619186138,"Learnings from 10 yrs. of Wall St. Experience - how to value stock, what makes stocks move, factors / macro Hey guys!! I spent 10 years on wall st (equity research and market structure) and wanted to help others learn to invest and gauge interest for maybe a paid course / book that puts it all together.

**TLDR: How to value a stock, what makes a stock move, and what to monitor for factors / macros.** 

(Also re-posting from /fluentfinance I thought this could be helpful here too).

If this is helpful - please comment! Do want to invest in a book or course that puts it all together?

**How to actually value a stock.** Super important to have an idea otherwise the market gives you say $DMTK at $70 and then later $40 - which one is correct? You'll want to buy at $80 then sell at $30.

How to do it:

Use 10K and presentation to find the ""drivers"" of the business.

Find the unit economics - for $DMTK, its tests, average selling price (ASP), number of clinicians, utilization of clinician. Then sales people and expected impact. Management will set some targets for these drivers.

That gives a framework to model future sales if they succeed.

Based on the business model and management targets, you can estimate gross margins (very important for scale - they say they can get to 60-70% with higher ASP), then operating margins over time (this will be negative / flat since they are investing in sale to keep growing).

Now you have an estimate of the financials of the business for next 5 years.

Then look for the right multiple. Find the best ""comp"" (comparison) - for $DMTK it's likely $EXAS as genomic testing company. $EXAS is still investing in growth - so its a sales multiple (about 12x forward revenues).

Apply that multiple on your forward estimate (I use 5-years out) assuming company will look like $EXAS and market will value it similarly, then discount back (I use 10% discount rate), which gets a present value in the $70s.

Now you have an idea of what you are betting on - what price the stock could go if management hits their targets, key factors (# of tests, getting ASPs from insurance coverage etc.), what risks you are taking (execution, reimbursement risk) and potential timeframe (at least 3 years).

**What makes a stock move.** Stocks make a whole lot more sense when you realize they are always forward-looking. Every stock will likely have a ""driver"" based on the business model that investors are focused on. Here are the key things you usually want to look for earnings releases:

Forward guidance - is this metric improving (i.e. accelerating on y/y % basis) or slowing (i.e. decelerating on y/y % basis). Very simply, improving is great, slowing can be negative.

Expectations - based on these new forward metrics, are earnings estimates going to move up or move down? (That's also where your model / value of stock is very helpful). When earnings estimates of a stock move up it almost always means the stock is more valuable.

**Awareness of ""factors"" and macro.** In the near-term most stocks move based on ""factors"" which are essentially quantitative groupings of stocks. And this is driven by the ""macro"" or the type of economic environment. As an example:

Factors - if you held any popular stocks ($PLTR, $SE), you felt those swings in the tech or small cap growth (XLK, IWO) over the past month. Or if you held popular China stocks ($BILI, $PDD) you felt the swing in the China market (GXC). Keeping those factors in mind is very helpful to not get scared out of positions (I've done that many times!!), and if you can, time the factors for your entry as well.

Macro - With economies re-opening and coming out of a recessions, the market essentially expects everyone to go out and start spending and activity to accelerate. ""Cyclical"" stocks are the ones moving right now. Airlines ($SAVE, $AAL), autos ($POAHY) as people move around. Retail reopening means better sales ($DBI, $LB). More ""stuff"" produced means materials are moving higher ($FCX, $MP). More growth means higher rates so better profits for banks ($JPM, $UPST).

**Happy investing!!!**","['FCX', 'LB', 'AAL', 'JPM']"
mwvt1b,gvkp7zi,StockMarket,comment,1619190898,"Thanks for the details. Appreciate the posts that put in effort.

It would be awesome if your example on $DMTK went through the numbers on the 10-K. I think that would be eye opening for some folks. If anyone is wondering where to find the 10-K, go to the investor relations of the company you're looking for. They will have the 10-K and often an Investor Presentation where they try to add context or details, what u/Empty_Performance308 mentioned with identifying the drivers.

How often do you find that companies don't come down to your target price and you would have been better buying them at whatever price they currently were? Price targeting would often preclude you from bull runs.",

This post is just to share what I have been tracking since I first started trading options in GME.  Every week or so I've been keeping track of option prices at different strikes.  When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week.  When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%.  That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130.  As you can see in this chart, the options market is not pricing in a big move anytime soon.  The expected $ movement week to week has been getting smaller and smaller.

What do we do with this information?  If you own shares or options then you can feel a little more comfortable that it's not going to drop to $50 overnight as CNBC would have you believe.  They parade idiots on their shows as Analysts (aka experts).  Keep in mind they are experts of history and have no predictive value.  Same for most people.  You could buy some insurance by buying longer dated call spreads in the $80 - $100 range as they are cheap right now.   Also, keep in mind as I stated in my previous post that the cheaper options b/c the more ability retail has to control the price through aggressive buying of shares and options.  Gamma pressure easier to manifest.  If the stock ever does drop below $100 I imagine the out of the money call options will be relatively cheap at first which could be a good buying opportunity.

Everyone is waiting to hear the transformation plan led by Ryan Cohen.  The first sign of that may be on the June earnings call.  

I won't update this every week but when I see a change in trend or a big move in IV maybe I'll post again.  Good luck!! 🚀💎 🙌

BlackBerrry’s collaboration with Amazon.com Web Services (AWS) is truly something to get really excited about, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud.  Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.

BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry.  Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers’ abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights.

BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX’s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS’s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle’s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY’s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k8jnz4dg4iv61.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=332562ea2e475ec71455d52feb6aee9b907d454f

For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car’s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver’s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents’ desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat.

BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform’s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail.

In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform’s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system.

“Data and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. “This software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy.  We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.”

“AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user’s needs and preferences,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.”

The future looks bright for BlackBerry

&#x200B;

I believe the collaboration on project IVY with Amazon Web Services (AWS) could evolve to become a major needle-mover for BlackBerry stock, as it continues to push toward meaningful organic growth to finally prove itself to the skeptical analysts that maintain their hold ratings and single-digit price targets.

BlackBerry stock has collapsed, yet IVY is still happening, and contrarians should be as excited as ever as the company looks to spread its wings in the auto market, which may be on the cusp of exploding higher on the back of EVs (electric vehicles) and autonomous driving technology.

Although the QNX business hasn’t recovered as quickly as most investors would have hoped, I still think BlackBerry stock is a great value bet for those willing to put up with turbulence for the next three to five years. Looking ahead to the post-pandemic environment and things are likely looking up for QNX and many other segments that have fallen under pressure due to COVID-19.

Add IVY into the equation and I think BlackBerry may be shaping up to be one of the greatest Canadian turnaround stories of all time.

TLDR

Stay the course and put your trust in the hands of CEO John Chen, and I do think you’ll be happy with the rewards to be had over the next decade. The stock is likely to yield meaningful fruit over time.

myzf4r,,wallstreetbets,post,1619448689,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.

https://preview.redd.it/thiw0k9v6jv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=79936feeeeca457ede4d38f1ad7e1765dd402d68

For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation

b. One month after recommendation

c. One quarter after recommendation

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/8fuxjisp6jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a346af5eb6a8b3733c7ab13390dab1de5b4562

Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods was better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analysts made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

https://preview.redd.it/hsml4g6f6jv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=80758b9786b9962e308d20ba28495e9e139ae859

Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)

**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:**

https://preview.redd.it/vflyq18t6jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a35ad742267d57e9e2b33281d2bef8ea83dfb38

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley who made more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:**

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks fared.

**Conclusion:**

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There have been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of assets you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

When did you assume that the stock was purchased?  Most (all?) analyses that I see assume that the stock was purchased at the last price immediately prior to the recommendation being released. But most such reports cause the stock to move up or down immediately upon their release.

It was suggested I repost it this morning, so I am, and as part of that I have included some helpful updates based on some of the comments I did receive. If you read the original, you can just look for the* ***Updates:.***

***1.*** ***Intro***

Greetings Apes and Apettes! I'm excited and a little scared to post my first DD here. I learned of WSB like many of you and have been commenting and trying to be a good ape since January when I jumped on the GaymeStonk hype train. While I knew quite a bit about the market due to my work and education, I will admit that my investment strategy up to this point has been ""buy Vanguard Index Funds."" Safe, but boring. Being a part of this community has pushed me to go out of my comfort zone and finally make an ape gamble on something other than buying GaymeStonk shares.

So, I've been reading your DDs, watching the financial news, and just generally paying more attention to the markets in search of my first options play. I need to earn my stripes, one way or another, and I have found my first target: [$LADR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LADR?p=LADR).

***2.*** ***The Target: $LADR***

**Ladder Capital Corp** is a REIT traded on the NYSE with a market cap of just under 1.5BN. It's not a huge company by any stretch and options volume is a little low, but hopefully not so low that this post gets clipped. The company was started after the 2008 crash by three former executives who all worked for an internal real estate hedge fund at UBS. That HF collapsed after making investments in the subprime housing market. **I'm sure they learned their lesson and vowed** ***never to do that again***. RIGHTTTTT.

In fact, what they're doing now is *probably worse*, though the fallout may not be on the same scale as what happened in 2008. After all, the entire CMBS market is only **\~$500B**, as opposed to the residential housing market at \~**$8T** just before the crash (btw, current housing market sits at \~**$35T** \*\*\*whistles\*\*\*)**.** So, even if the entire CMBS industry goes tits up, we're not looking at a complete economic meltdown like we had in 2008, *unless it causes other dominos to fall, but that's another topic..*. Anyway, we can still make money if the thesis is correct, right? So, read on, dear apes.

What set me down this path was [this recent article](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/), which someone coincidentally linked in a GaymeStonk thread. Weird, I know, but take a read if you have a few minutes as it forms the basis of my thesis.

***Update: If you're an ape who can't read, you can watch this video that the author of the Intercept article and Flynn did with The Hill last week:*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=pRHwhvUc54A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=pRHwhvUc54A) ***Thanks*** /u/_dmm ***for the link!***

Reading this article first is sort of putting the cart before the horse, but the main point is that [Professor John M. Griffin](http://www.jgriffin.info/bio/) from UTA, decided to do a forensic analysis of claims made by an SEC whistleblower and found those claims to be **correct**. The claims will be discussed in one second, but just know that this guy's specialty is ""*forensic finance, or understanding the role of anything that is potentially illegal, illicit or immoral in financial markets*."" If you want to read the actual paper Mr. Griffin published, you will definitely develop some extra brain wrinkles. The paper can be found [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162). It's a good, but technical, read.

Anyway, according to Griffin, the worst offenders when it comes to income overstatement are shown on the right side of this graph:

[Most of the shadow banks above the line on this chart are probably decent put plays](https://preview.redd.it/e34jcp09aiv61.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3b14dca2e49628d3360d4d656d71893bbd1e233)

*Smol aside*: *I was curious if John Griffin and Kenny Griffin from Shitadel are related or if it's pure coincidence that they have the same last name. I can't find anything saying they are related, so let's chalk it up to a common last name. That said, it appears that Shitadel thinks $LADR is garbage, too, as* [*they have been getting rid of their shares and have purchased substantial additional puts*](https://fintel.io/so/us/ladr/citadel-advisors-llc)*. I feel dirty that I may be on the same side of a bet as Kenny G, but what's an ape gonna do???*

Anyway, the genesis of the Griffin study was a 2019 SEC whistleblower complaint that is discussed in this Pro Publica article from **May of 2020:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds). The article describes a complaint filed by [John Flynn](https://commercialobserver.com/2018/07/john-flynn-cmbs-transparent/), [a veteran of the CMBS industry](http://creloanadvisors.com/), which alleges rampant overstating of borrower income to prop up shitty loans that were packaged into CMBS by 14 major lenders including Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and our target Ladder Capital Corp. The world renowned plaintiff's class action attorneys at **Quinn Emanuel** have taken note of the impending CMBS market correction and issued a very detailed and easy to read [firm memo](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/publications/us-outlook-potential-cmbs-litigation-arising-from-the-2020-downturn/) on the subject, which explains the myriad ways this thing could fall apart.

Anyway, $LADR isn't just taking loans originated by unrelated mortgage loan officers from various banks around the country and packaging those up into shitty CDOs. No no; they are **originating the loans themselves** and then packaging those crap loans together with other, better looking loans, and then **securitizing the garbage for their customers in an inflated CMBS.** I shit you not. Seems weird to risk your reputation by selling crap, but more on that later.

On top of the above, the firm appears to be engaging in some pretty shady practices when repackaging loans acquired from other lenders that had been part of a previous a CMBS that was unwound. Flynn's whistleblower complaint states that Ladder has been revising the previous income statements of the borrowers such that their **net profits were overstated anywhere from 10-30%** from what was reported by the prior lender, meaning they were given much larger loans than they are capable of paying off.

All of this just screams SHORT THIS SHIT, but if you want another reason to hate on Ladder, and I'm not trying to make this political, note that one of Ladder's largest investors is **Steven Ross.** If you don't know him, let's just say he's a billionaire BFF with 45 and, get this, Ladder is [one of the Trump organization's biggest creditors.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/09/billionaire-stephen-ross-holds-stake-in-one-of-trumps-biggest-creditors/?sh=7a2848863af4) Whatever you think about Trump as a President, one thing we know for certain is that he's [not that great at real estate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html)**. Seriously, don't make this political**. This is about *fraud and bad bets in the CRE market*, not politics.

The final point I will make here is that the outlook for CRE for 2021 is just not that good overall, to say nothing of the CMBS market. The [National Association of Realtors is predicting](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-q4-commercial-real-estate-trends-and-outlook-survey-01-21-2021.pdf) Q1 2021 CRE prices ""to decrease in the office market (-3% y/y), retail (-6% y/y), and hotel/hospitality (-6% y/y)."" Guess what markets $LADR is heavily invested in? That's right; [office, retail, and hospitality](https://s2.q4cdn.com/455099226/files/doc_downloads/company_overview/2021/03/Ladder-Capital-Company-Overview-(March-2021).pdf).

***3. Timing***

So, this shit is shady and Ladder seems ripe for a fall, along with the rest of the CMBS market. In fact, I think you could make this bet against most of the offending lenders identified in the Griffin study, but especially against the shadow banks like Ladder. Thus, the real question is; **when lambo**???

This is a REALLY tough question and where this play certainly opens the door to either major gain or major loss porn. ***Please, only bet what you're able to lose***.

The problem, of course, is that the market was made aware of this malfeasance when Flynn filed his complaint **in February 2019**. Flynn was under the assumption that 10 year commercial loans sold in the run up to 2008 crash would be defaulting in 2017-2018, but that didn't happen. From the Quinn Emanuel memo: ""*Commercial loans backing CMBS typically have a shorter term than the residential mortgage loans backing RMBS, and a different amortization schedule. For example, a standard CMBS loan will have a 10-year term during which it will pay mostly interest and very little (or no) principal, with a large “balloon” payment of principal at the end. Often, the loan is refinanced at the end of its term, meaning that some or all of the balloon payment becomes the subject of a new loan, with a new term, which is frequently then secured in a new CMBS.*"" So, when the original CMBS 1.0 loan defaults didn't show up in the market, Flynn started digging and found that the original loans had simply been repackaged and papered over to new investors based on the **newly restated and inflated NOI** numbers, which triggered his SEC complaint.

But, the SEC hasn't acted on the complaint (AFAIK) and the market just didn't give a shit. Oh yeah, his complaint isn't actually public, either. What's more, Feb 2019-Mar 2020 was a banner year for CMBS returns and commercial real estate in general. Further, most analysts of the CMBS market agree that the new ""CMBS 2.0"" market is much healthier than the CMBS 1.0, i.e. pre-2008, market, so ***there's a chance I am completely wrong on this***.

All that said, the $LADR stock price did plunge from its ATH of $19 in Feb 2020 to about $3 in March 2020 due to the **COVID scare** that caused a broader market downturn at that time, but it has steadily inched back up to where it is today, at around **$11**. How can that be if their business is built on a pack of lies?

Well, as the Pro Publica article mentions, the Fed [threw a bunch of money at the CMBS market via the CARES Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm) last April (PPP, mortgage forbearance, etc.), which likely kicked the can down the road. And while Biden's recent **$1.9T** **American Rescue Plan** doesn't contain any *direct support* for the CMBS industry, it's clear that the QE provided by that plan will likely push any widespread CMBS correction further into 2021 or 2022. This aligns with some speculation by the Motley Fool (\*throws up a little\*) back in June that people should keep their eyes open for CMBS failures ""[over the next 12 to 24 months](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-financing/articles/cmbs-fraud-allegations-propublica-and-industry-veteran/)."" There's also an outside chance that the [2020 Hope Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7809?r=98&s=1), which ""*establishes an equity facility in the Department of the Treasury to assist commercial mortgage borrowers*,"" could still pass and kick this failure can further down the road.

All that said, my prediction is that we'll likely see a *short term uptick* in the CRE market as businesses come back on-line following the easing of COVID restrictions, but this won't be enough to save the market from bad underwriting. The [Griffin study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) supports this when it says, on page 4, that ""*the difference between dubious and duteous originators will persist after the current COVID crisis.*"" So, we'll eventually see the house of cards collapse and I'm going to bet it does so **by the end of this year or early next year**. Now, if there is some wider market correction \*\*\*cough CLO/Treasury collapse\*\*\*, this could all happen *much sooner*. Note, the farthest out you can buy puts on this stock is 12/17/2021. \*\*\*sad trombone\*\*\*

I will also be paying close attention to the $**LADR** **Q1 earnings release on May 3, 2021.** Current EPS consensus is .08/share, which is the same as it was for Q4 2020, but which the company missed by .03/share (actual EPS was .05/share). Note, the company issued a dividend of $.20/share in the lead up to their Q4 2020 earnings report, and they have [done the same for Q1 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladder-capital-corp-announces-first-201500466.html). Accordingly, I'm also predicting **a** **30% miss on EPS for Q1 2021**, just like Q4 last year. I don't anticipate, however, that this EPS miss will have a huge impact on share price. Might drop it a buck or so in the short term. The real fall will come when their shitty loans start going bad later this year.

***4. Target Price***

As far as price goes, this is where I get out of my depth. I am just not equipped to crunch all these numbers from the articles and read financial statements and all that shit in order to say the company is going to drop by X%, so I'm just going with my gut feeling here. **I would really love some help on this point from some wrinkly brain apes who are good with numbers.**

So, I'm just going to look at what happened to the stock back in March 2020 and say that it will probably happen again when the shit hits the fan; ***the price will drop to around \~$4-5/share.***

***5. Counterarguments***

So, there are obviously a lot of counterarguments on which I would be happy to get some feedback. I have considered these, but maybe not weighted them strongly enough, in drawing my conclusions. I welcome your comments and criticism on these and any other counterarguments I may have missed:

* Even if $LADR is chronically overstating the income of their borrowers, the value of **the underlying real estate may be sufficient collateral** to stem any losses from widespread defaults.
* **Most analysts are bullish on this stock**, with the consensus rating now being to **buy**. Current analyst price target range is $12.50 - $14.00 with **an average of $12.80/share**.
* As the Intercept article posted above notes, Ladder's ""[three largest tenants are Dollar General, BJ’s, and Walgreens.](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)” This is good for Ladder given the current inflationary economic environment as consumers are looking for ways to save money and discount retailers benefit from this. In fact, Dollar General is having an amazing year. Their stock price has gone up about [55%](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/DG#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--) from **$140** following the March 2020 crash to **$218** yesterday. So, **if Ladder's largest tenants continue to do well, Ladder may be able to absorb/mitigate any loses** from their poor underwriting for other borrowers.
   * ***Update:*** /u/steveressi12 ***and*** /u/_dmm ***both note that DG isn't actually doing that well. DG apparently has a Debt:Asset ratio of 75% (I haven't been able to independently verify this number). DG is also going to*** [**hire an additional 20,000 employees**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-general-dg-hiring-spree-130201383.html) ***soon, which will significantly increase their expense load. This is bad news for their ability to pay back their debt. Lots of bearish DG articles on Yahoo! Finance in the last week. I may do some further DD on DG, as it looks like that may be another good bearish play. Guess I'm becoming a*** 🌈🐻?
* **Ladder's business is not limited to CMBS origination and securitization**. They also are a commercial landlord, which could, again, offset any losses from their CMBS shenanigans.
* **Ladder won't be holding the bag** if these CMBS fail; *their investors will*. As the Flynn study notes; ""*the loan originator is not paid according to the loan’s future performance, but from fees and markups when the loan is sold... \[Accordingly,\] originators and underwriters may have incentives to build and burn their reputation.*"" So, there's always a possibility that **these securities fail, but** **Ladder survives**.
   * ***Update:*** /u/steveressi12 ***notes that Ladder's weighted LTV is about 67% (another number I did not independently calculate), which should be sufficient to weather a few defaults, ""barring a major uptick in cap rates across different CRE spectrums."" S/he also notes a weighted average remaining term of 13 months might be ""odd for a portfolio of that size"" and that ""their unencumbered asset to unsecured debt ratio is relatively thin (1.74x vs. 1.50x typical unsecured facility covenant) and loans that are struggling are typically marked down more aggressively within 12 months of maturity... All in all it should be an no \[sic\] interesting two quarters to see what they do.""***

***6. Closing***

Boy, if you've read this far, I really appreciate you and would welcome your thoughts and criticism.

I feel pretty good about this thesis, but not good enough to YOLO, since it's my first time doing something like this. In fact, I've only made a very small investment by purchasing the following Puts:

* **20 x 12/17/2021 $7.50p @ $.25/share**

***Update:*** ***The following math is just the easiest way to calculate a potential gain on this play.*** /u/greenday10Dsurfer ***pointed out that the EV/IV of these options could actually result in a bigger gain than this depending on if/when the stock crashes. The thing I will be watching is the premium on these contracts. If it goes above $2.25/share I will be doing better than the below scenario.***

If I'm correct, my potential gain is **\~900%:**

|Cost of Contracts (20 contracts @ .25/share = 2000 shares x .25 = $500) + $20 commission|$520|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of 2000 shares @ $5 price target|$10,000|
|Right to sell 2000 shares @ $7.50 strike|$15,000|
|Profit from share sale|$5,000|
|Profit minus cost of contracts|$4,480|
|Total Return (4480/500)|**896%**|

Yes, a \~$4.5K profit on a $500 investment is **small potatoes**, but I want to dip my toe in the water and see if my ape brain is working properly before taking bigger risks.

Let me know what I missed, fellow apes and, again, thanks for reading!

My question is in regards to stock price (an Aphria shareholder will receive .8381 of Tilray shares per each share of Aphria).  That said, I’m sure I’m wrong, but if you owned 1000 shares of APHA @($14+/-) you would now get 838 shares of Tilray @ ($17+/-) replacing 1000 shares. Is there a benefit (or not too much of one) to be on one side or the other as it seems like that’s kinda baked in price already as they mirror each other in movements. Ex. Right now Tilray is 17.85, Aphria is at 14.70. If you take .8381 of Tilray, it makes Aphria at a price it should be of 14.96. 
Am I understanding this correctly? the two will most likely be priced to be almost equal at time of merger. Thank you, appreciate....just trying to see which side to stay on as I keep moving, or hold both. (My long cannabis position)",

Yes everyone has heard of LiDar tech and its pros and cons. But the one thing everyone gets wrong with MVIS is that their LiDar tech is much smaller than the rest of the markets which allows car makers to use them and not have it look unappealing to the consumers. Plus MVIS is doing much work to make their LiDar at a much lowers cost which is key especially for the average car instead of the higher end cars. This will allow auto makers to catch up to the autonomous software used in the higher end cars without the automakers having to invest a lot of time and money. Then there is their Augmented reality which is gonna be huge in the years to come. We all know the hololens 2 made from Microsoft that  uses  Microvision Tech in the augmented lenses. However it seems a lot of people overlook the use of augmented reality into today's society. Hello pandemic goodbye big business conferences, meetups, face to face interactions.

Future of construction, construction workers can work on the physical site with an augmented layout of what they are working on and be able to interact with that blueprint right at the sight. How this will save so MUCH MONEY AND TIME for construction. Hello Biden administration massive infrastructure plan over the next 10 years. How about training new employees. There are many people looking for jobs and many companies hiring (today's issues of hiring isn't not enough jobs but not enough qualified people for those jobs). So how do we get those people hired and trained quickly to be able to keep up? Augmented reality! A much more fast and cost efficient way to get that on job experience. This can be applied to mechanics, healthcare workers, construction workers, many sales & marketing, field service, farming, architecture. The uses of MicroVision tech and almost infinite.

You can read this vaccine all over mainstream media, the news, and what's most important is in India, they may be on the verge to accept this vaccine for distribution because of the huge amount of cases of COVID still ongoing rampaging their country.

 President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India outlined how the two countries can cooperate and work together to fight this pandemic.

This is all very very very exciting news for holders of OCGN, and look at the asking price. It's fairly low for a company who may be the next Pfizer, Moderna, JJ.

myyiyl,,wallstreetbets,post,1619446187,"$XM Qualtrics - Your Favourite Company’s Favourite CompanySo much of what gets posted here is some stock with incredible growth potential and very little REAL value, like a bet at the roulette table on 35 black.

Qualtrics is definitely NOT that type of company. So what do they do? They operate in a new SaaS (software as a service) company that uses AI and deep learning to bridge the experiences between business, employees, consumers and products. It’s a cloud platform that helps businesses grow, engage employees in a positive work culture, customers spend more and companies develop better products. Right? BORING.

Here’s what you actually need to know: they IPOd this year and are severely undervalued. Over 13,500 companies and organizations use XM, including about 80 of the Fortune 100 companies. Q1 subscription revenue is up to $186, up 46% YoY. And forward guidance is super juicy. Remaining performance obligations total $1.1B, which is up 77% YoY. If you don’t already know, performance obligations are contractual agreements to delivery services for revenue, a peek into future earnings. Fair value is $154.71 according to DCF modelling.

The stock popped about 22% on an earnings report released after market on Wednesday. What was really interesting was that the earnings report didn’t contain any real information. Their IPO filing already had disclosed through its performance obligations what the revenues were going to look like. What had happened was that the market had finally admitted/realized some of the latent future cash flows.

And BTW don’t confuse this ticker with Sirius XM Holdings LOLLLL

I didn't mind that they were issuing shares to raise capital, because I figured they were going to use the opportunity provided them to make a big move to be able to come into reopening with a real jolt. Maybe a $PLAY acquisition or at the very least a partnership. Use the time to retool their operations to an all in one entertainment option of some sort instead of the tired old model of $20 movie tickets and overpriced chicken sandwiches.

Instead, executive leadership used the money to hand themselves fat bonuses for ""saving"" the company when they literally didn't do anything but let the share price be elevated on sentimentality and meme status and act like they had something to do with it.

Then they asked to issue even more shares. No vision. Just cashing in and using the company like an ATM.

So I voted no. Millions of times. Then spent a few days unwinding my position. The company is dead to me. I don't know why anybody would invest in them. They had an entire year to come up with ideas on how to grow their operations or make a move, and they literally just collected their paychecks and raided the company coffers. That's bad leadership",

I've only been trading for 8 months, so I have less experience in seeing this kind of thing play out. 

I understand that the 10M new shares aren't releasing to the public, but to private/premium buyers - I assume that means certain investment funds whose focus is biotech? Or perhaps individuals in the biotech industry? 

I haven't dug particularly deep into that - but my question revolves around whether or not folks think the price will correct down to $10 tomorrow because of that?

myichy,,wallstreetbets,post,1619386849,"$AMD earnings coming for a long term winner VOL 2  So AMD. Long awaited and slightly delayed  2 DD on AMD

This possibly a long read for anybody with an attention span lower than 50 seconds and needless to say it will contain words that you were not taught in 5th grade. You read the following summary if you happen to be a drooling neanderthal  
 

Summary

Great business, getting better, smashing Intel in coming years, price is low ,gonna surge, buy fucking ape

**Performance and demand**

We are now on going through a cycle of extreme demand for products that facilitate digitalization, EV’s, pc, datacenters expanding. This has all been accelerated due to the covid cause all you dumb fucks have been watching 4k Pornhub filth from you mums basement, while pausing the newly acquired PS5. Those of you with a job perhaps thought working from home would require a new laptop and what have you.   
 AMD delivers the chips for all this. AMD doesn’t make the shit slow useless chips but the high-end stuff which the market just can’t get enough of. Take look here from last year:  


[  ](https://preview.redd.it/r00ra8z42ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=202c74284d233302021728aa85fb4ba74b3f424a)

Notice the gross margin rising a bit whilst revenue is up 45% Y/Y. The numbers and performance are both completely ridiculous.

 And the FCF here killing it 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/duor4te82ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fde98b17738977483ab0e7d77363a4c53b5e811

  

And their official outlook from last earnings:

  


[  ](https://preview.redd.it/d4c3gafa2ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=92970732d0fe8eee9f2ba564e0a52cdcb5cb0ac0)

Most analysts though have higher expectations than the guidance from January. Can’t blame them. AMD will in coming quarters buy XLINX and expand their business to other segments in the semi conductor industry so there is plenty of room for further growth on the outlook.

&#x200B;

  **Supply and competition**

TSMC is the main foundry supplier for AMD. They have kept prices intact but there are so far rumors that they might hike them soon enough. Last year many of the sites were shut down and capacity hasn’t met the surge we have seen late quarters. The problem is not exclusive for AMD but it’s the same for most of its competitors. They have stated though that they expect to be back on track for 2022. Intel got hammered last week in earnings with losing market share in datacenter segment and margins absolutely murdered. AMD has been trading inverse to Intel basically as the market expects AMD to be one of the main causes to Intel's howler.

However let the bears beware of the CEO’s lady Su’s own words live:  
 ""we have enormous demand, demand is very, very strong"" continuing their seeing record growth in multiple areas including PC, gaming and datacenter. Lisa added: ""to answer your question, it's good -- it's very good""  
 [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html)  
 Now ask yourself if that’s something a smart insanely well performing CEO would say 6 weeks before an earnings report if the shortage was really smashing the business. My cents are on her being right and even a bit conservative on it.

  

**Analysts**

Market analysts are quite divided on the target ranging between 70 and 135. The best rated one here Hans Mosesmann has a price target of 120. Look at his bull following  here:  


https://preview.redd.it/sff74g1h2ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0a633c6ae0959148e8859d4b968f54499e4df7

  

As for my positions I hold a few calls but mostly shares. I think this is a long-term case but earnings could be a blow out like last summer that caused the stock price to explode. Its a bet if you fancy but If you buy leaps you are defo safer. Shares are really attractive at these levels though","['AMD', 'AMP', 'INTC']"
myichy,gvw9cf5,wallstreetbets,comment,1619411351,"$AMD is pegged to 10x P/S, if they meet expectations and Lisa Su reiterates 37% growth, their fair value should be around $91.50 (with a Year end target of $113) so I expect there to be a run up to that amount before earnings.  Lisa Su tends to be conservative in her guidance, so you may want to sell before earnings, or hedge your bets here.  However, I believe she'll guide much higher, considering all the rumors of extra Wafer capacity at TSMC, to as high as 80% extra capacity at 7nm, due to Apple jumping to 5nm early \[[https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html)\]; so if you're a betting person, you'll hold onto your calls, especially if they're already ITM, because I'm expecting AMD to go stratospheric!

Vast majority of my 5/7 Calls are ITM, ranging from $75 to $82, but I also have a bunch of cheap $100 lotto Calls as well, I'm planning to keep all my Calls past earnings, since I'm expecting $91.50 to be the absolute floor.

They have have knocked one of those titans out of the box and are quickly closing the gap on the other. The 11th generation Intel chips have been slammed hard by the press and customers simply aren't excited about their offerings anymore.

myloui,,wallstreetbets,post,1619397497,"$TAP Miller-Coors: A company that has re-invented itself and wallstreet is sleepingAlright retards, here’s a DD that contains no technical analysis because if this company had good technical’s it wouldn’t be a sleeper. This is a social arbitrage DD. Also, I don't care about how many micro-brews you have in your town. Beer is somewhat irrelevant to this play.

Molson-Coors is no longer the piss beer coors brand that your drunk uncle remembers. It’s now a company that’s woken up from the dead with new leadership and rollout of fantastic products. They have focused on a completely new product lineup, that involves seltzers, energy drinks, THC beverage’s, and a ""beyond beer"" segment. Couple all these new products with the lockdowns ending globally and you are going to have a monster Q2/Q3 earnings report. Not to mention this stock is beat down so much from wall street it’s a asymmetric trade as it stands right now.

First off, wall street fucking hates this company and for good reason. The past 7 years they were stagnant and failed to adapt to new markets/trends. They took on billions of debt to purchase SABmiller. Another shit beer company that wasn’t doing shit. The beauty of this is that wall street is frozen and is going to be late to the party when they get smacked in the dick with earnings for Q2 and Q3 of this year. They have a wait and see attitude to towards this company and they will be forced to pile on once they see the results from the new products molson-coors has deployed.

To name a few:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer: Owned by coke but Molson- coors has exclusive manufacturing, distribution and marketing rights. This new seltzer is the hotness on the streets right now. It had a soft launch 3 weeks ago in 9 states and it already has over 3% of the seltzer market. Go out and pick some up(if its not sold out everywhere) and I promise you you’ll be throwing your life savings into this company on Monday morning.
* Zoa: New energy drink from the Rock. Who knows how this is going to sell but with the Rock pushing this to his tens of millions of social media followers, im sure it’ll do just fine. I've spoken to a health store(cant name it here because of the automods) rep who have said this is selling as well as redbull and monster.
* Light Sky: One of the best if not best light beers out there. Its blue moons light offering. Go check it out, it’s a crushable summer beer. Perhaps the best light beer on the market right now.
* Yuengling: Signed distribution rights to expand the company to the West Coast.
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer: Another new solid seltzer offering. Has vitamin-c and shit that all the crunchies like. Also has great taste and flavors.
* Coors Seltzer: Not sure who buys this but I heard its selling really well. Just glad the company has many different seltzer offerings now.
* Truss Beverage: THC infused beverage offering that’s killing it in Canada and has plans to expand to the US.
* [Beyond beer hub](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2021/04/08/Molson-Coors-launches-Beverage-Hub-for-beyond-beer-beverages): This is super exciting. Molson-coors has been bleeding out the past 10 years because they failed to adapt to new and emerging markets. This endeavor will enable them to be on the cutting edge of any trend that is emerging. Just think, if this company got into seltzers when it was starting to materialize 4 years ago, the stock prices would be well over $100/share minimum. With this hub you can be sure that Molson-Coors will never miss an opportunity like that again.

The Selzer game is absolutely huge for this company. This is a main pillar of the company’s revitalization. The seltzer market is doubling every year and theres projections TAP will take a minimum of 10-15% of the market with Topo Chico and Vizzy alone. That is hundreds of millions to billions in revenue for a company that only has a 10B market cap. This can easily drive this stock price up by multiples.

Check out this quote from an insider: “Just talked with a 10 year brewer in Milwaukee with coors- moors, extremely bullish conversation overall. Coors seltzer is see high sell through, heard vizzy is selling well, he brews light sky and blue moon, said sell through has been amazing, told me the company acquired/did a deal with columbay(?) For a hard coffee drink, he raved about the sampler packs they got, and extremely good initial response from that, rolling that out soon but didn’t know timeline, he’s heard topo is flying, the whole company is buzzing, but didn’t know much beyond that. Said his factory laid 200 people off start of 2020, and have now hired back 350. He was extremely enthusiastic. Overall said in his ten years he’s never seen coors do so well. Very confident in management and direction”.

All of these solid new product additions coupled with the US coming out of lockdown and they are going to blow the tits off earnings Q2 and Q3. I expect the earnings call this week to be terrible for Q1 due to lockdowns and a cyber attack that stalled beverage production. Good time to jump in.

TLDR: Revitalized company with new leadership, fantastic new diverse product offerings coupled with ending lockdowns will be rocket fuel for this company. Q1 earnings will suck because of the lockdowns and cyber-attack disrupting production but Q2 and Q3 will blow the tits off wallstreet. In my opinion the Q1 report will give us all a solid price to buy in. $SAM 6X in 3 years and I expect similar performance or better here. The stock is so beaten down from the past 5 years it's a safe asymmetric play with incredible upside potential. Even Michael Burry owns this. But he'll probably sell out before it rockets like GameStop because he's a boomer.

My Position: 20 $47C Oct '21, 30 $70C Jan '22, and 769 Shares(Buying after earnings 5/29)",

Miller coors does not even crack the top 3 products in the fastest growing segment. $SAM has been smashing earnings, and if white claw is the ""coca cola""/first brand that comes to mind, then Truly is the Pepsi of the seltzer market.

mye01g,,wallstreetbets,post,1619374487,"Viacom CBS DDSo bear with me cuz this is the first time I have ever pulled back the curtain from lurking to actually step up with my own contribution to the community... so let’s just get right to it my fellow crayon munchers, we all know about the Archegos fund meltdown and what it did to big ticket holding like DISCA and VIAC. 

Now obviously after seeing drops like they went thru no one wants to touch these stocks with a 10 foot pole, until now. These stocks massive sell off has created a huge opportunity for another bull run on Viacom since it is now undervalued by about $15 or about ~25% increase in the stock price as it currently sits. Conservative fair value estimates put the price target for VIAC at around $55 while some of the more bullish analysts price targets I have seen are sitting at $69 which would give it an upside of 42.0% (coincidence? I think not). Anyways all things aside the sell off has basically put a top performing stock on firesale with a huge upside that wall st has just started to see in the past couple weeks as it was up 8.24% this past week. 

While I know alot of you apes see gains under 10% and are like so what who the fuck cares if its not 70% intraday gains like GAMESTONK or MVIS, to which I say fair enough keep sewering your money on weekly FDs if you please (I am still long GME with shares don’t crucify me for looking for other opportunities as well). However, if there are any apes out there who are looking for some longer term safe plays with decent returns look no further, Viacom is a massive media conglomerate with rock solid financials, stellar management team and solid business model, their shift to streaming orientation is going to really boost their growth and kickstart what I believe will be the comeback of the year forsure. Position 1000 shares at $38.40 lets go to the moon boys, you saw what Archegos did to the stonk lets show em why the planet of the apes is just as powerful!

TLDR: VIAC is on fucking firesale right now because of Archegos sell off and Wall st is just now seeing the opportunity for a comeback, this is a hugely profitable company that is a healthy safe bet which is set to head back towards its previous levels in the next year so expect upwards of 20% growth by mid year.

30 patients have been dosed so far. This drug treats two different diseases-- sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. 

Everyone that has done followup for this trial is symptom free. The people with sickle cell disease have been free of vasoocclusice crises, which is an incredibly painful occlusion of blood vessels. And the people with beta thalassemia have been transfusion independent.

Severe presentations of these diseases cost north of 300k/USD a year to treat, fyi.

Some retard on this board three months ago said the current trial data wasn't enough to mean anything, but it apparently means enough to pay 1.1B USD for an extra 10% stake of revenue pre-approval. So fuck whoever that guy was.

Think of it as Wix, but for automation and artificial intelligence, only Wix simplfies the process of web design for their users, while UiPath simplifies the process of designing and applying intelligent bots and deep learning. Their purpose, they claim is “To accelerate human achievement”. More from their IPO filing:

“Our platform leverages the power of AI-based computer vision to enable our robots to perform a vast array of actions as a human would when executing business processes. These actions include, but are not limited to, logging into applications, extracting information from documents, moving folders, filling in forms, and updating information fields and databases. Our robots’ ability to learn from and replicate workers’ steps in executing business processes drives continuous improvements in operational efficiencies and enables companies to deliver on key digital initiatives with greater speed, agility, and accuracy.”

Cool story, bro. Let’s talk fundamentals.

Its market cap is currently \~40B USD. It has INSANE gross margins, between 82-89% for the last two years. They’ve cut their operating costs from $520M to $92M in just a single year, trimming their cost of sales and marketing from 144% of revenue to 62%. This investment in sales and marketing has already offered immediate returns. It has generated revenues of $336M and $607M in the last two years, representing a growth rate of 81% YoY. The icing on this cake? They also disclose that their top 50 customers increased their spending by a MULTIPLE OF 81x from their first month to present spending. In other words, the clients with the most money to spend couldn’t wait to give this company more money.

More: “As of January 31, 2020, we had 6,009 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 61% of the Fortune Global 500. As of January 31, 2021, we had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500.” The company is already disrupting the accounting industry. A representative from PwC spoke about saving 5 MILLION HOURS of work by using UiPath, saving them $500M already.

And then the cherry on top? Cathie Wood and ARK Invest have already purchased 2.7M shares.

TLDR: UiPath talks the talk, but they walk the walk. And I like the stock.

my31ry,gvti89v,wallstreetbets,comment,1619360036,"OP godspeed but I have been watching PLTR every single day for like 3 months and you're doing 2 of the things that almost guarantee you to lose money w/ PLTR calls.

1) you're buying them for a week when the Fed is speaking. J POW talks on like Wednesday and/or Thurs (not to mention Biden). He might not say something bad but recently the market always acts like he is going to until he actually speaks. This is largely what causes the stretches where PLTR bleeds down to like ~$21.50.

2) you're not buying the dip (when it's below or at least @ $22/share). You bought them when PLTR is doing reasonably well by its standards recently.

Seriously, like 1/3rd of the S&P is reporting earnings this week which could make things volatile as fuck. Also Biden and J pow are speaking. I'm not saying I know what's going to happen, I just know at LEAST one day is going to be blood red and perhaps catastrophic. And Jeronimus Powell can make the whole week red if he wants to with a simple flick of his forked little tongue. There is also of course the chance that everything moons but... It's PLTR lol. 

Luckily you could be saved by the Monday morning rip. This could be great if you pill it off. Usually no matter what, PLTR will rip for a second first thing in the AM (it might dip first), but after that there is a real chance of it cratering and bleeding out for the rest of the week.

Best of luck, if I were you I would sell as soon as I make any profit whatsoever and re-up when PLTR craters this week during the volatility. I've lost so much money doing what you're doing and have gotten it back by:

1) buying pltr calls on the dip (sub 22)
2) doing 2 week expiry minimum to save my ass incase anything happens 
3) paying attention to the fed schedule

Bias: I bought May07 PLTR puts @ 23.50 on Friday. but you can bet your ass I'm going to buy as many calls as humanly possible this week if it crashes

best of luck !",['SPGI']

Market is as confused as a Zoomer exposed to good music, so instead of something new, let's re-visit the last DD's, see where they shook out, and update them (DD ""Where are they now"" 30 for 30 edition)Hola!   NrdRage here.  My apologies  for not posting this yesterday, but  Reddit, with their extreme ethics  (?) put me in a corner for 3 days for  upvoting a couple of comments my  daughter made about motorcycle  safety.  Good to see their priorities are  in order, An upvote from the  same NAT, that's way more important than  employment background checks  on pedophile enablers, right Reddit?

Given   that last week's DD was my first complete WHIFF (seriously,   embarrassingly bad, but we'll get into that), I'm going to work hard to   find a layup for everybody next week.  Think I've found one, but with   that tax bomb President Harris tossed out yesterday, I don't want to   name a new ticker, even if I think it's all smoke (because the mere act   of sabre rattling can shake a market, and there's sure to be plenty  more  of that in the coming weeks as the administration attempts to  normalize  the plan to create the actual highest cap gains tax rate in  the world).   So instead, let's go back through the DD's (the ones I  haven't deleted  because they were no longer effective, at any rate) and  update them and  where I am with them.  This should hopefully, for at  least a day, stop  people from grabbing a DD from 2 months ago and  jumping in then  wondering why the trade is different.  Oh, who am I  kidding, I know you  fucks, nothing will stop that.  At the very least,  it should shut up the  small group of people who played the trades wrong  and declared them  broken.  Let's start from February, so right after  the first round of  people who ""liked the stock""

# DD #1:  $PLTR.  Original Date January 27th, 2021

&#x200B;

[I tried to tell you retards](https://preview.redd.it/pqrvl3j266v61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b59d3513e9581b0babd63301fc9dd1cb8482387)

**URL:**    Ended up deleting it - not because the DD was wrong, but because the   Palantards got it to about -700 karma and I decided to let them get   crushed.

**Original thesis:**    $PLTR (then $35) was wildly overpriced based not only on their market   cap as a company who's almost every dollar is already priced in as a   result of their reliance upon government contracts, which span years,   their reliance upon the courts to force those contracts to be extended,   but also because the company insiders were selling stock like mad,   George Soros had signaled he was going to sell the 4% of the float he   controlled for ""ethical reasons"" (hah!).  Oh, and because Peter Thiel   participates in the wrong type of political ideology amongst the tech   elite, that he was so unfavored that there would be active attempts to   harm his ventures.

**Original price target:**    I stated the company was worth no more than $22 and that people  should  open $25 puts expiring in late March.  In later comment updates,  I  stated that one should buy puts any time the company strongly  eclipsed  25, and should buy calls any time the company sinks to around  22, as  that's its rangebound territory.

**How did it work/what has changed:**   Not a single thing.  It was literally impossible to screw this trade  up  unless you went against it.  So, of course, most of this sub did  just  that and lost money.

**What the smart play is on it today:**   I no longer buy puts in $PLTR, but any time I see it creep to 22, I  buy  a biweekly $22 call.  Easy money that I will then put on the end of  a  fishing pole and hold over the head of a Palantard.

**Trade rating:**  10/10.  15 bagger (and counting), plus you got to point and laugh at half of this sub.

# DD #2:  Weed Stonks.  Original date February 3rd, 2021 (a non-Friday DD)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rsk2tbc566v61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf756ce0a9fad711fd9fce0af241b7768ec065c3

URL:  [Right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh6ttf/pass_the_bong_and_gather_round_bros_were_gonna/)

**Original thesis:**     You're the bad kind of retarded if you were throwing money into  SNDL.   If you wanted a ""cheap"" stock, you should go with one that  doesn't put  fucking rubber and plastic in their weed - so to buy a  stock like  Organigram instead if you could remember their stupid  fucking name.   $APHA and $TLRY should be joined at the hip and either  APHA must come up  or TLRY must come down.  Talked about $CGC and $ACB,  though didn't  endorse them.  Matter of fact, I didn't really endorse  any of them.   This DD was more about ""well, I can't tell you not to do  this stupid  thing, but if you're going to do it, at least make less bad  choices  amongst the stupid ones"".  Way to make me feel like a pearl  clutching  Boomer parent, assholes.

**Original Price Target:**    I didn't give any, because it was all obviously a bubble and I was   mostly advising people to be careful with the play, but to pick better   companies if you were going to jump in on it.

**How did it work out/what has changed:**    If you read between the lines and TRADED (read:  Scalped like Crazy   Horse) these stocks instead of invested in them, you probably fared   pretty well.  All the weed stocks peaked a week later and then started   their decline (except for $APHA, which continued to rise for a while   before collapsing as it tried to find equilibrium w/ $TLRY).  My own   results were originally mixed on this.  I made a lot of money scalping   Sundial before getting out of the way at the top and laughed as it   collapsed to the surprise of a million braindead stoners.  I made some   pretty decent money on TLRY, made quite a lot on APHA (and then gave it   all back and then some on a stupid play for the merger that expires on   the 30th, a nice 7 figure waste of money), and made some money on   Organigram, but I kept the 1/22 $5c's and am reasonably certain they're a   complete loss, but just like bagging Olivia Munn, there's always a   chance.

**What the smart play is on it today:**    Don't touch any of them.  The reality is, long term, these Canadian   companies are going to have a hard time penetrating the US market, even   if the product is federally legalized.  But, more importantly, the one   thing every weed company has in common with one another is that they  are  absolutely TERRIBLE at execution.  This is why you don't make  stoners  CEO's of publicly traded companies just because they're  passionate about  the product.  They've got the easiest product out  there to sell, and no  matter how low you set the bar, they somehow find  a way to trip over  it.

**What you should play instead if you want to get in this space:**     $MO.  Yeah, you heard me, $MO.  Think about this a moment:  These   guys sell tobacco.  A product that they are forbidden from marketing or   even talking about, which gets hidden away behind cages in stores,  which  has been completely wiped from movies that might product place or  even  being MENTIONED in public because of regulations.  A product  which in  some places it's illegal to use in your own home or alone in  your  vehicle as you take a 10 minute break from your soul-sucking job  and  question every choice you've made in life, just hoping to get 5  minutes  of sweet relief before you have to head back behind the Wendy's  to  finish your shift....and they STILL sell billions of dollars a  year.   Say what you will about their product, but these fuckers **know how to execute.**    And they're already in America.  You don't think that they won't be  at  the front of the pack when that shit gets legalized?  You don't  think  they won't give up the brown leaf for the green leaf?  You don't  think  they won't start buying up every Ganja Goddess or Chronic ReLEAF  store  they can find once they're allowed to?  Fuck outta here.

**Trade rating:**    8/10:  You made money if you followed it and got out a week later,  you  made even more if you caught how lukewarm I was on the entire  sector  and picked something else, and you saved a lot if you got out of  Sundial  like I said, but the weed play really died out a very short  time later,  so the upside was very limited.

# DD #3:  $BB.  Original Date February 12th, 2021

&#x200B;

URL:  [Right here, bitch-o](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liezfr/nrdrages_friday_dd_theres_still_one_meme_stock/)

**Original Thesis:**    Using another company that pivoted from enterprise applications to   automotive ($NUAN) and has no competition, extrapolated long term   earnings potential of a company pivoting from phones to secure   automotive and fleet management.

**Original Price Target:**    87.50.....in 2023.  My positions were very early, so my average PPS  is  7.67 and my calls are 5's, so not really playing the same game.  I  have  since added, over time, a load of 1/23 42c's at an average cost of  like  80 cents.

**How did it work out:**    Thesis still holds, though it would sure be nice if the green number   reflected a mammoth spike in equity price.  The only reason this  company  isn't sitting at 20 right now and well on its way to smart  vehicle  dominance is because of the damned chip shortage.

**What the smart play is on it today:**    It's still buy and tuck away in a hole somewhere like a Boomer.  Grab   the farthest out, farthest OTM calls you can find (they should be no   more than 50 or 60 cents).   You'll still be a massive disappointment to   your parents, but maybe you'll be able to trick them that you're   starting to grow up enough to where they'll let you move out of your   refrigerator box and housesit for them when they go on a cruise.  Hey,   speaking of....

**Trade rating:**    5/10:  I expect this one to age like wine and ultimately be a huge   profit maker, but the chip shortage was a resistance point I failed to   consider so it hasn't seen the immediate burst.

**Original Price Target January 2022:**  $NCLH 46, $CCL/$CUK 47/42 respectively, $RCL $90.  My     positions      were    established a month and a half before the DD, so     my cost   basis    was    different.  I was holding 700 1/22 25c's in   $CCL and   2000 1/23    $42.5c's    in $NCLH.

**How did it work out:**    If you jumped in shortly thereafter and played the stocks      right,     you    made enough to buy your own boat.  Sure, maybe it  was  a    17'     Bayliner    that all the women at the marina called    ""adorable""   and  were    clearly    conflating towards what they    assumed was your    pathetic 2.5""    penis size    at diamond hardness,    but it floated, it    had an engine,   and  dammit, it    was yours  and   you had enough left    over for a   captain's  hat and a bunch     of   beer money.  This one  was   hard to screw   up -  especially since  it    was   the first one I   started  providing   updates on  and made  sure    everybody   knew to take   profits  at 32 on   NCLH and buy   back at  29  (and  to continue     playing that  range), etc.    People  in  these   from the date  of posting   who   didn't  just buy and    hold likely    have turned at least a 6    bagger by now.     This trade  was,   and to   some  extent is, still solid    gold.

**What's happened since then:**              In spite of none of the companies in question needing to    issue        shares   as they had enough cash on hand, $RCL issued    shortly  after    that    DD,  $CCL  immediately copied them, and $NCLH    followed  suit a    couple   of  weeks   after $CCL.  At least none of    them tried  to pull  an   $AMC  and   have the   CEO go on TV and  give   zero credit  to retail    investors  for   saving the   company  and   instead taking  all the  credit   before  diluting   and then    paying   himself a fat ass  bonus  for doing   nothing  but issuing    shares like     some sort of  conquering  hero.  The   amount of  the  dilution   in   question   meant  that the  resistance  price  of (to  use  as example,     $NCLH) of $32 a    share  already  represented a   higher  price than   the   pre-virus share   price.    Ditto  for the  other  2.   Investors   haven't seem   to have  noticed,    however,   and these  stocks  still   trade in the  general   range,  though the     resistance  level is now    more like 31/25/85.    Also,  the  sailing    schedules  for  the   domestic  cruise ships has  been  pushed   back  as a   result of     somebody high up at  the CDC  obviously  shorting    these  stocks,  as    that's  the only  explanation  for why they're   so   focused  on trying   to   send these  companies to 0   by  preventing   sailings.    Norwegian  is  resuming  cruises  outside  the  US in the next   couple  of   months.

**What the smart play is today:**              These 3 companies are no longer as attractive as a result  of     the        dilution, but they're still good swing traders within   their       respective     channels.  I'd put up a picture of some   charts to  show      those, but I     already told you where the   resistance is,  grow a      wrinkle and learn  where    support is.

I          have since   exited  my positions in $CCL (and was never in    $RCL),     and   have   drastically  reduced my holdings in $NCLH, but I    do  still     maintain a    skeleton crew  of January calls for them.

**Trade rating:**              9/10.  It was really hard to fuck this one up, unless you    just        didn't   believe me. And it's still a live trade.  The only    thing  I       could have   done better was post it sooner, but I  make   sure my    trades     are   established and going the right way  before I   talk  about   them in     depth.

# DD #5:  The Semiconductors:  Original Date February 26th, 2021

&#x200B;

[And before you ask, yes it is.  Took this the other day when I   decided    to    start working on this. In retrospect, should have   washed first.](https://preview.redd.it/y6vlid9g66v61.jpg?width=1530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bfae5eeadc261cda360675c53f44c33d6ca1582)

**URL:** [For you poor, broke ass souls who missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt89s3/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_semis_play_not_just_the/)

**Original Thesis:**          While everybody was spooging over high end chipmakers like  Theta        Semiconductor, $AMD, and $NVDA (and, to be fair, I had been   telling       people to buy $NVDA 545/580c's, which were all   multibaggers), the   real     action was in the commodity level   chipmaker space,  specifically    American   companies (or companies   that could masquerade  as them) who    would line   up to the trough to   get some free  government money to go    from being   nofab to fab   companies.

**Original Price Target:**          $NXPI 200-210 within 3 months; $ON to within 43 within 3  months,       $MRVL  to 75 within that same range.  And I didn't give a  price   target     for  $UTZ, just that it would go up.

**How did it work out:**          LAMBOS for almost everyone!  Supposing you could order one,   given      that  they can't get the chips they need to build the cars.       $NXPI   got   to  214 before pulling back to 202.  $ON hit 43 2  weeks   before I     predicted  it would.  $MRVL failed to live up to    expectations and has     been  essentially dead money since that    posting, but if you'll  recall I    was  very explicit that I was    bullish on them ONLY as a 5G  play,   whereas  the  others I felt had    more range and scope.  So  short-term   $MRVL play  was a  loser if you    moved up the timeline I  liked.  Oh, and   $UTZ printed  for   everybody   that just bought in  because they liked the   product.  It   was a   nice  little pocket play.

**What's happened since then:**          The trade ran its course to perfection.  As I've been saying  for  a       little while now, semis, with the exception of $NVDA, are  not     presently    an interesting trade because there's been a  rotation out  of    them  after   this period of growth.  I am still  incredibly  bullish  on   the  sector as a   whole, but they need a  breather and  some time  out  of  the  sun before   continuing a leg up.   They're not  even good   rangebound   trades right now.    And LOL @  any of you  clowns who bought   $TSM  anyways  because Cramer  and his  cult of  Shortbus All-Stars   told  you  they were  the best in breed.   Suckers.    In the case of  $MRVL,  they  acquired  another company and  now are  going  to  ""officially""  become a US  company  instead of that  tax  dodging shit   they've been  pulling, which  means the  thesis  about  them lining up for   gubmint  money is sound and  will happen   down the  road.

**What the smart play is today:**         Ignore semis till at least June; probably July.  I have exited   out    of   all of my positions and have taken immense profits from the      commodity   semis.  I similarly got rid of my $NVDA calls at the  top,     though I am   willing to find a re-entry point in the 575 range  if  it    happens.  Don't   be sad that the trade is over, be glad that  it     happened and you might   have been there.  Or at least be happy  that I     was there and am   appreciative that I got to stack a bunch  more  paper    I'll never spend.    Either way.

**Trade rating:**  9/10.  Absolutely perfect call, with only $MRVL being the laggard, but it came with the appropriate warning.

**URL:** [Got buried in a mountain of Gibbons doing dumbass ""DD"" on their stonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/)

**Original Thesis:**         People are finally willing to take greenhouse gas emission   capture      seriously, and the infrastructure and transport sector is   finally   ready    to start moving away from diesel and traditional oil   based   products  in   favor of carbon negative renewable natural gas -     especially  companies   making carbon pledges or located in states   where   progressive  leadership   is going to demand emission reduction.     $CLNE  was uniquely  positioned  as  the nation's leading provider  of   that  fuel source and,  unlike all  the  other green energy   EV/charging   companies out there,  actually has a  real  product that   they sell in   large quantities, making  it a diamond in  the  otherwise   pipe dream   green energy space.

**Original Price Target:**  $17 by late May, $31 by next March

**How did it work out:**         I said to buy it as soon as it got under 11.  It got under 11  the      very  next trading day.  Then immediately shot up almost 50%  within   10    days  and was one of the few stocks out there  consistently   finishing    green  while the entire market was tanking.   As long as you   played it    smart and  heeded warnings about stonks  not always just   going up and    taking profit  after parabolic rises  and looking for   re-entries later,    then you made  enough money to  put RNG high powered   engines in both  your   boat from  cruise stocks  and your Lambo from   semis and convert  your   entire house to  being  powered by cow farts   before the green  energy   sector got   skullfucked.  If you held, you'll   feel this trade  didn't   work out   (though it still will, if you   picked the June target  date like   I  said)  and, if you re-entered   after taking profits, you've  either    been  averaging down lately as   this has been getting unfairly  dragged    down  with the entire green   energy sector or else you're   underwater on    it....but you'll still be   fine.

**What's happened since then:**         A LOT.  From them getting dragged down from the mid 15's all the     way    to below 10 on nothing but good news to them signing major      partnerships   with $BP, Total and Citgo, to signing a half a billion      dollar deal  with  $AMZN to power their long-haul fleet with RNG to      Washington DC  flat-out  stating that methane capture is a capstone  of     their green  energy plan,  there has been nothing but good news  coming     out of this  company.  And  yet It got absolutely PUMMELED  with the     sector for the  last month, and  then this past week  started Monday     morning up 27% only  to not only give  all of those  gains back but  lose    another 20% by the  close of trading  Tuesday  because of a  combination    of market  manipulation by a hedge fund   that shorted the  stock into    oblivion for a  hit and run (do a search  on my profile by  posts and  look   up my Wednesday discussion if you  want to be  absolutely fucking    infuriated that someone borderline  committed a  crime) coupled with them    paying off an analyst at RayJay  to run a hit  piece on the $AMZN deal  to   try and sink  the stock  price even lower,  right down to that hedge   fund  suppressing  the  price of the stock  for 2 weeks to keep it under   $12 so  the most   popular options for  April would expire worthless.    This  company has,  in  short, been  subjected to a biblical level of   fuckery  that was  probably  was some  Mortimer Brothers bullshit for a $1   bet, and  it's  still  standing and  ready to spring. Oh, and somebody   informed  me  that they  got some  airtime on Cramer's show on the 24th.    Jimmy  Retard  is luekwarm on   them, and you should always inverse him,   so  balls to the  wall, baby.    Especially since he tried to compare the    2009 version of  this  company  (when nobody gave 2 shits about nat   gas)  with the 2021   version (where  governments are going to force   people  into this type  of  product and the  transport industry is   finally  transitioning away  from  oil).

**What   the smart play  is today:**    My thesis, as written back then, is  EXACTLY  what I would  write even   today.  I stand by every last thing  in there,  including  the strike date   and price, in spite of the hedge  fund  bullshit that  artificially tanked the stock for no reason other  than  unmitigated  greed.  It was my   favorite stock in the whole  market then,  and it  still is now, just   balanced against the  knowledge that, as a  very  small midcap bordering on   a small cap,  it's easy to push around  and  very clearly fucked some hedge fund  manager's wife or something. If  you  don't believe me, every   analyst  out there says this company is  worth  double what it's at now. My  original position still exists, except now  it's bigger and I'm also the  owner of a lot (and I mean a LOT) of shares  on top of it that I was  gobbling up like a porn star eating all the  money shots in an episode  of Blacked on Tuesday and Wednesday.

**Trade rating:**    10/10.   Nobody was talking about it before that DD.  You made a   multi-bagger in  just a few days if you jumped in, and even though   you're battered and  bloody right now on the 2nd run with them because   of the manipulation  from a hedge, you're still going to make mad   tendies with this one.   They've got EVERYTHING going for them,   corporate America is looking to  them for the carbon negative fuel as an   easy way to lower their  footprints, no competition other than a  shitty  (4 letter word for non IPO company) building their first   capture plant  who has NO fueling depots or infrastructure, politicians   demanding  carbon neutral fuel and, unlike most of the sector they  reside  in,  actually have a product and make money.

**The thesis:**     The clusterfuck in Texas this past winter, combined with  California's   annual inability to provide even basic electricity to its  residents as   the state burns to the ground and they try to push  everybody into  EV's,  created a unique opportunity for a green energy  company that  existed  completely in its own space:  Weather immune  green energy  microgrids  that could scale to any size, literally NEVER  go down as has  been proven  by large-scale pilots in Delaware and Cal  Tech,  and  didn't have the  drawbacks of batteries.  Oh, and  politicians finally  acknowledging that  our utility grid is well beyond  end of life and hot  garbage and not  wanting voters blaming them for  citizen deaths being  willing to spend  taxpayer money to address that.

**Original Price Target:**  70% conviction of a $32 price by mid-April, 45-50 by August, and a long term target of $72

**How did it work out:**    I  had the unfortunate pleasure of posting this DD right as the  entire   green energy space was being crushed by big money rotating into   ""value""  and later into ""the 10 biggest companies in the S&P to  make  SPY go  up"", so things haven't gone as planned to this point.  The   stock has  actually fallen from the 27's all the way down into the  22's,  though it  has rebounded this week and looks to be starting a  fresh  run.  It's a  bit of a hail Mary, but that 5/21 32c that I was  hyping  back then....it  might still print.  Though even I rolled over  my May  calls to August at  the same strike to buy more time to make up  for them  getting dragged  down with a bunch of companies that aren't  even in the  same space as  these dudes.

**What happened since then:**     They haven't announced any big deals, but I know they're working on    some.  And they set up a new global office in Dubai to start marketing    their products worldwide, which should only give them tailwinds going    forward.

**What the smart play is today:**     I still stand behind everything written in that DD, with the only    thing I'd like to change is the expiry date on the calls from May to    August.  And again, if you're sitting on May calls that are way, WAY    down....I wouldn't cut bait with them just yet just because they're    already almost worthless and there's still a puncher's chance they fight    back.  This thing has started to get some life, and I wouldn't bet    against it being able to hit that strike in a month - well, I wouldn't    bet a lot.  I would just feel better if it were 4.  Long term, this is    still going to be a great investment.

**Trade rating:**    I was  going to give this one a 2/10 just because it had been going   almost  straight down for weeks now killing the May expirys, but the   longer  calls and shares are still very much alive, but I'm going to   upgrade it  to a 3.5 because it's made some good movement, and I will   cross my  fingers that, by this time next month, I'll call it a 6.

**URL:** [How was this one of my most popular DD's?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8inij/nrdrages_friday_dd_the_absolute_shittiest_company/)

**The thesis:**     Simple:  A re-opening play.  $RYCEY is one of the only companies in    the world that has not rebounded from the pandemic, and as soon as    people start flying en masse again, demand for their engines (and    maintenance contracts) will start buoying the stock price

**How did it work out:**     I said buy shares and tuck them away.  The stock hasn't really moved    since that DD, and should still be tucked away.  The condition for   their  recovery (increased air travel) has not yet happened, therefore,   it's  not their turn yet.

**What happened since then:**     People have continued to be afraid of their own shadows.  Especially    the Europoors, even though England no longer even has enough cases to    qualify as being in a pandemic.  Dumbasses.

**What the smart play is today:**  Same as it was then.  Buy shares.  Hold.  My positions haven't changed.

**Trade rating:**  4/10.  Their turn for recovery is taking forever, but it'll get there.

**The thesis:**   One of the  few biotech companies in the world worth betting on long  term.   Transformational technology, market leader.  Also, gave me an   opportunity to collaborate with Cathie about the stock (though, because   of my, to be charitable ""un-PC"" vernacular, she declined to put her  name  on the DD).

**Original Price Target:**  50 by mid June, 60's by 2021

**How did it work out:**    We're now officially in the space where the long-game trades are  still  developing and can't yet be judged.  The stock, typical of every   biotech, has been very choppy in this uncertain market.  It opened up   big a couple of days after the DD, but has drifted downwards since that   point.  The volatility still makes it a great intraday scalper, and the   thesis is still sound.

**What happened since then:**   The rotation away from high multiple high growth stocks has continued,  especially after President Harris  proposed increasing the cap gains  tax to the highest in the world.

**What the smart play is today:**    I stand behind the DD and thesis, and the entry points are still   attractive.  I would move the strike price down into the low-mid 40's,   however.  My position has not changed.

**Trade Rating:**  Incomplete.  Still developing.  I was very clear this one was not for the faint of heart.

**URL:** [You're late, but here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnksim/nrdrages_friday_dd_ill_take_a_mackinnon_jersey_2/)

**The thesis:**    The $ICLN ETF, which was mostly just $PLUG, was rebalancing in a big   way; Blackrock would thus be purchasing massive quantities of shares of   stock in the new companies.  $NEE was uniquely positioned because it  had  the stability and rotation safety of a value stock, but the  multiple of  a growth stock

**Price targets:**  I said definitely take profits at 83, and my positions were June 75's and 77.50's.

**How did it work out:**    Flawlessly.  The stock basically rocketed to $80 as Blackrock   purchased shares much more aggressively than anticipated, and anyone who   played this trade with me and watched volume would have noticed the   volume fell off a cliff and took profits before it started creeping back   down (as everybody else was taking profits, too).  I exited my   positions near the top and stacked all the money in an air conditioned,   humidity controlled room that consumes immense amounts of coal power.

**What happened since then:**    The share price has started to pull back, which was expected.    Further, they had an earnings call, and you should almost never play   earnings in this environment.

**What the smart play is today:**    This trade is effectively finished - it was predicated upon a   rebalance, the rebalance happened, it was a lot of fun, we all made lots   of money.  This is still a really well run company but the short-term   thesis is no longer valid.  The DD will stay up only as a display of  the  company's operations, margins, and overall growth potential if you  want  to act like a Boomer and be a long-term investor.  I pulled out  all of  my short-term positions, and only maintain shares at this stage.

**Trade rating:**    10/10.  Took even less time than expected for the trade to complete,   and was never in any danger of doing anything but printing tendies.  No   matter when you bought leading up to the rebalance, your position was   green and stayed that way the whole time.

# DD #11:  $ISRG.  Original Date April 16th, 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/ms2pwzhs66v61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48d5a30b34e00bb9b21c4571cbc053739206ce54

**URL:** [Thus proving I'm not the Zombie Jew](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ms51jy/nrdrages_friday_dd_a_robot_may_not_injure_a_human/)

**The thesis:**    A pure earnings play that I didn't really want to write, but my 1st   idea ($PLUG puts) ran its course before Friday.  Analysts had been   lowering expectations for $ISRG for weeks, and even management was   saying things to make it seem like they were going to have a subpar   quarter.  Which made sense, given that a lot of operating theatres are   still closed.

**Price Targets:**    As it was an earnings play, didn't list any long term, but suggested   going long in a company that typically only melts upwards when the  stock  fell by 60 or 70 bucks.

**How did it work out:**    Not even slightly.  At all.  Absolutely TERRIBLE call.  They blew the   doors off earnings, beating by more than a dollar those lowered  analyst  expectations.  Sales were up.  Procedures were up.  Everything  was up.   Instead of going down 10% on weakened guidance, the stock shot  up 5% and  blasted through all-time-highs.  This was a big time loser  of a trade.

**So why did it happen:**   I can't take credit for digging this up, that credit goes to /u/Farmer_eh who did  all the sleuthing of HOW they pulled it off.  It turns out  $ISRG  accelerated depreciation on a lot of their production equipment,  and  also had an increase in inventory.  This means that they had a bunch  of  extra Da Vincis laying around in a warehouse and were selling them  to  medical centers at a steep discount, which is why they sold so many   more robots than any analyst expected (30% more than pre-COVID sales),   and also lowered their expenses for the quarter.  These are neat tricks   that a company can only pull every so often, and it was smart of $ISRG   to not only have that one in their pocket for a rainy day, but also the   wherewithall to play the card at the best possible moment.  So, in a   way, the thesis itself was sound and the quarter would, in fact, have   been a down one had they just been organic about it all, but I failed to   account for easily accomplished accounting magic and motivated sale   pricing to ensure a quarterly beat.  Which is something I'll remember   next time I think about shorting a company that beats on quarterlies   almost 90% of  the time.

**What the smart play is today:**    The original DD talked about letting the stock price come down and   then going long, because this is a company that is mostly always going   to go up.  However, it's run up so fast after those earnings that even   long is a dicey play now, so this is a company that, if you aren't   already in, you should probably stay away from.  However, buried in that   DD was commentary about how $PLUG had been beaten down to the level I   wanted to see it go to already, and that it was time to go long in  them.   I've had a couple of you message me, showing that you had read  between  the lines,  to say you covered your puts after that and went  into  calls.  So those are paying off.  As the green energy sector is  starting  to rebound a bit, $PLUG will naturally get caught up in that,  so  there's a play there.

**Trade rating:**    1/10.  It was going to be a 0, but, as mentioned above, if you had   read between the lines there, there was a secondary play buried in there   about $PLUG calls, so I'll give 1 single, solitary point on this   otherwise complete dumpster fire of a call.

All my love

myfmy1,,wallstreetbets,post,1619379090,"DD: DMTK - Short InterestGreetings you fools,  

Wanted to share my due diligence in a company I heavily believe in. 

DermTech (DMTK) focuses on non-invasive skin disease diagnostics, particularly skin cancer. Current standard for diagnosing skin cancer is to take a surgical lesion biopsy, which is an inherently invasive and unwelcoming process. DermTech has pioneered a new way to test for skin cancer through a non-invasive patch which is 99% accurate. This process cuts the cost of your standard biopsy testing by 25%. No cut needed. I came across this company while looking for undervalued buys in Q4 of 2020 and continue to add because I believe this will become a new adopted standard. DermTech has recently entered into an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas to use their product as an in-network option for melanoma testing. 

Better yet, they do not require any FDA approval. 

From the May 2020, S-1 filing-

""We have not obtained regulatory approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for any of our tests as we operate a clinical laboratory under the CLIA guidelines and believe our tests are laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that are not currently being regulated by the FDA.""

Now, I’m sick of these short-sellers going after companies with amazing fundamentals, products, and processes. My goal is to predict trends, and I’m confident that genomics will be an industry dominate trend 5-10 years from now, maybe sooner. This company is heavily shorted with a short float of 23.64%, and I honestly couldn’t tell you where the opposition is grounded. 

**My opinion:** Genomic medicine will lead us into a world in which we will easily understand what health conditions we are at risk for. Moving from a system in ‘which we fix you after you are sick’, to one ‘in which we know what you are going to become sick with and preventing accordingly’, will turn the global medical industry “upside-down.”

I've completely YOLO'd my savings on this company, wish me luck, or don't, fuck you.",

If EXAS (colorectal screening aka poop in a box) has a smaller addressable market and is at a 25billion market cap. Then DMTK has a lot of room to run. The skin cancer market is huge. For a cheaper non invasive option, DMTK is the way. Haven’t understood why it’s been going down so much over the last few weeks.",

my0fns,,wallstreetbets,post,1619323560,"Calling all apes: CLF cleveland cliffs, diamond hands? Why not steel hands?Edit\* position 232 shares followed by 20 call options spread across the year

Hello, today I am going to try and convince you why you should buy CLF, before we go any further you should know I have about 1/3 of my total cash invested into CLF. Here is a list of catalysts.

**1.** Steel Prices continue to rise with no sign of slowing down.

according to this chart [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) Steel has been trading at all time highs week after week. This is due to a supply shortage. Steel demand has not gone down since Nov 20 2020.

**2.**  Infrastructure spending trends worldwide are on an upward climb

This chart is a prediction of future infrastructure spending globally  [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/four-big-infrastructure-trends-for-2021/) but aside from this prediction it is not a secret that Biden plans to compete with China and Russia on infrastructure, In his press conference when he released his infrastructure bill He said he wanted to beat China. Most if not all infrastructure spending will involve steel or other building materials in some way or another. If 3 main world superpowers are fighting over economic dominance in infrastructure this will continue to raise steel prices.

**3.**  CLF is not a stranger to massive increases in stock price.

Back in June 6th 2008 it rose to 104$ a share and then in April 8th 2011it rose to 98$ a share. These were due to similar circumstances we are seeing in the steel Market today with these non stop increases.

**4.** We are currently in a commodity super cycle.

If you look around you will not only see steel vastly increasing but you also steel OSB sheets of plywood now going for 70$ a sheet. Other commodities increasing on a similar scale to steel are. Bitumen, Nickel, copper. With all of these commodities increasing at the same time its safe to assume demand keeps going up with the anticipation of the infrastructure plans as well as seasonal summer construction.

**5.**  China plans to cut its rebate on steel.

according to this [https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/steel-traders-alert-for-china-steel-export-rebate-cuts/) China plans to cut its steel rebate dramatically. Its not a shock that with rising steel prices they wouldn't want to purposely take a hit to their trade export revenue. If China cuts the rebate down it will spike Steel prices worldwide.

**6.**  China plans to cut steel production to meet carbon emission goals.

China is finally going somewhat green. (finally) With china lowering steel production this would drive steel prices up substantially due to supply not being able to meet demand. Scarcity could be a short term catalyst but a catalyst nonetheless.

Well MP sits at a mining site in the middle of the desert out near the Cali-Nevada border.  [They sit just south of Las Vegas](https://www.google.com/maps/search/mp+materials/@35.4652108,-115.5387785,17915m/data=!3m1!1e3) right next to a highway for easy transport of the extracted and purified materials as they both mine and refine the ore. 
 
Well let's start with what they do: rare earth materials mining.  Not the sexiest job on the planet, but it is necessary for all things tech.  Rare earths are a key component of clean energy, IT, defense, industrial applications, and neat little magnets.  [China was by far the #1 producer with 83% of the total worldwide production](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prd-wret/assets/palladium/production/mineral-pubs/rare-earth/mcs-2017-raree.pdf) but now with MP Materials pumping out ore [they have fallen to only 58% of total worldwide production](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-rare-earths.pdf)    
 
The market isn't going away but China could pull it's supply which is a huge risk to the US tech industry.  On top of this, demand will be skyrocketing with a [projected increase in electric car production from 2.5M per year now to 31M per year in 2030!](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html).  More specifically the annual demand for [rare earth magnet oxides are expected to increase 5x in the next 10 years to $16bln](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/astronomical-rare-earth-demand-growth-forecast-2020-09-29) - and if that isn’t enough potential revenue then also consider next year [MP will have finished their own on site processing facility to produced finished metals instead of ore](https://mpmaterials.com/about/).
 
Also worth considering [China is only the leader because their population bears the cost of production that will likely see boycotts or backlash as new facilities are available](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-07-28/china-rare-earth-tech-pollution-supply-chain-trade) and [MP has created a sustainable process for extraction](https://mpmaterials.com/sustainability/), so likely the top brands will start pushing for more sustainable processes with less negative impact and potentially force China to clean up their act / increase cost.  
 
The US-China relations are at a pretty fragile point.  [NASA has even called Taiwan a country](https://www.newsweek.com/unforgivable-china-furious-nasa-calling-taiwan-country-1580084) which is a hugely sensitive issue.   The current administration seeks to counter Chinese competition and upend their dominance and has been [reviewing the reliance on China for rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-biden-order/biden-to-order-review-of-u-s-reliance-on-overseas-supply-chains-for-semiconductors-rare-earths-cnbc-idUSKBN2AI2HJ).  
 
[The price of rare earths is rising, and it caused a jump in the stock price earlier in the month](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mp-materials-quarterly-profit-jumps-on-rising-rare-earths-prices-2021-03-18) - the soaring need for electric vehicles should continue to push it further.  Though the stock price jumped, it did plummet on news that they were [issuing some additional shares, about 10%, to fund new green energy initiatives.](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2021/MP-Materials-Announces-Pricing-of-600-Million-Green-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx).  With a larger focus on environmentally friendly projects, it makes $MP a prime target for eco-conscious investors.  
 
In my opinion, the price dive spooked a large amount of investors sending it way below it's fair value.  10% dilution rocked it to a 30% price dive that it is coming back from strongly now.  It’s also worth noting the share offering was at $35, which is $5 more than the current price - meaning the serious buyers know the value of the stock is well above its current value.  $MP doubled the analyst estimates for EPS in Q4 last year and don't look to be slowing down.  [Looking ahead, the forward looking EPS estimates put it at close to $2 for a 15 p/e ratio](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MP/earnings-estimates) with $0.38 EPS in 2021 - and they’ve only been operating for four years!  2022 EPS is expected to jump more than 50% to $0.58 and that is **before their processing plant is even open!**.  It’s not too hard to see that growth continuing with the addition of selling finished materials, increased demand, and increased price of the rare earth products which is on pace to continue for the next 10 years.  
 
MP materials hasn't been around long, taking over the site from failed Molycorp, but appear to be hitting it at a good time.  Now not only are they expected to be profitable quickly, but also have the new $584m in cash to ramp up and clean up their operation to ensure a sustainable and competitive supplier of rare earths.
 
If you look at their earnings presentation: https://s25.q4cdn.com/570172628/files/doc_presentations/2021/MP-4Q20-Earnings-Deck-FINAL-(3)-3.18.2021.pdf, the story keeps getting better though.  They had 100% YoY revenue growth and are still reducing the cost of production.  Modest for Q4 YoY, but 25% for the entire year.  
 
So that’s the basics of MP, but why the hell should you buy now?!?!?  Well, let’s look at the [current short borrow utilization](https://imgur.com/gallery/EJFwoFR) - that big drop - it wasn’t people selling, it was an 18M share short attack! Now the short utilization is up to a whopping **93% and climbing!**  (Note: I prefer FF on loan for Ortex because it tracks the SI much closer than their estimated SI).  So now the price is climbing again, they are almost out of shorts to borrow, and shit out of luck.  As they cover over the next month or two - we can expect the price to rise easily back up to $45, especially with the Q1 earnings call around the corner.  And when they beat earnings….. It’s gonna fly!  
 
On top of that, the growth stocks have all been on a severe downtrend over the last month - but are popping back into fashion now.   With the huge SI, low share availability with only 130M shares, and momentum of growth stocks in vogue today - shit’s gonna sail.

Edit: I did some digging and [estimated the Q1 EPS based on actual REO prices from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021, and came up with $0.27 EPS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5HiTyzSbs7v7xsNUM-YF-lY1LEEG9VwYUIqFtdPy0E/edit?usp=sharing) or more than 3x analyst estimates.  A further very conservative estimate for the year puts it just under $1 EPS, way above analyst estimates as well!  When the Q1 earnings come out, this shit's gonna go REE!

Hello apes, have not posted a technical analysis in a while. Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.

\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$

\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!

\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.

\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.

\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.

Please have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.

TL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr 🚀 🚀 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd",

Anyways, MindMed has been trading OTC in like Canada's market or something (I guess there are companies that exist outside the USA) so only brokers that allow OTC trading let you buy it. As of today though not anymore!

They announced that they will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 under the symbol: MNMD.

Reasons I invested:

1 To get in before Nasdaq listing (not too late to do so)

2 Always saw the psychedelic market to be the next drug market to boom (It still is relatively new market, more research and potential catalyst in the future)

3 I believe in the research (our generation is like number 1 in rising depression cases and most treatment for depression sucks. This research can be revolutionary for depressed apes that Yolo'd too many FDs or actual depressed apes that aren't retards.\[Edit: Other mental health issues they are studying to treat are; anxiety, addiction and ADHD\])

4 Kevin O'leary AKA Mr. Wonderful is invested in it (I usually don't buy into celebrity endorsements but Mr. Wonderful believes in the company and he doesn't invest in something he would lose money in. Also he did mention MindMed to Cathie Wood in a four panel interview on CNBC a week or two ago. So possible Cathie Wood interest after listing)

5 Nasdaq listing allows more money to flow in (after April 27 robinhood retards can throw YOLO money into it)

6 I like the Stock

The only disclaimer is that I am not a financial advisor and this would've been a YOLO post if I didn't lose so much money on stupid PLTR calls

Mods plz this is my first legit post here ever

edited a lil more info

Edit2: So there are people getting banned for mentioning the OTC ticker because its not 1b market cap. But it def is over 1b, sitting at 1.1b rn on Yahoo.

mxoljm,,wallstreetbets,post,1619285351,"$FUBO - Stock Analysis (Warning - Long DD)# Company Description:

FuboTV is a live TV streaming company focused primarily on sports which offers subscribers access to thousands of live sporting events, news, and entertainment content. The FuboTV platform allows users to have access to their content through streaming devices such as SmartTV's, mobile phones, computers, and tablets. This company gives the option to purchase additional features/packages that include more DVR cloud storage, number of simultaneous streams, international sports, adventure channels, etc. The base package provides a mixture of channels which includes the top 50 Nielson-ranked networks that span across sports, news, and entertainment. In the summer of 2020, they enhanced their sports offerings with the addition of ESPN and ABC as well as programming from Disney. In addition, FuboTV supports 4K streaming, although much of its content is streamed at 720p and 60 frames-per-second video quality. Since live TV requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure, Fubo utilizes industry standard digital Rights Management Technology and geographical rights requirements which enables them to meet blackouts if they were to occur. With all that content, FuboTV is one of the most expensive live tv packages that you can buy. Their competitors include the likes of YouTube TV ($64.99), Sling TV ($35.00), Hulu Live TV ($65), and more. Fubo's growth strategy is focused on acquiring new subscribers who are attracted to the sports and entertainment offerings that they provide. They monetize their subscriber base through subscription fees and digital advertising and in 2020 the majority of their revenue came from monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, in January of 2021 Fubo announced that they plan on acquiring sports betting and interactive gaming company Vigtory (see recent acquisition section) and they expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year.

# Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Live TV streaming is changing the way people watch their favorite sports, shows, and other entertainment content. As a result, more people are deciding to stop paying for traditional TV. Due to this disruption, billions of dollars in subscription and advertising revenue has shifted to streaming platforms. The global video streaming market size was valued at $50.11 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 21% from 2021 to 2028. In addition to the streaming market which Fubo currently operates in, their commitment to providing sports betting has expanded their total addressable market. The global sports betting industry reached a market size of $203 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by $144.4 billion from 2020-2024 (11% CAGR). What hinders the growth of this industry is the fact that sports betting is still illegal in many parts of the world. Sports betting is currently legal in a number of states in the US and in countries such as the UK, Denmark, Italy, China, and a few others. While sports betting is legal in a number of countries, often times people have limited access. For example, in Costa Rica you can only bet online and in India only a few states allow sports betting.

If we add together the total addressable markets for live TV streaming and sports betting in the year of 2020 we get $253.11 billion. Compare that number to Fubo's revenue of $268.8 million in 2020 and we see that Fubo has a huge opportunity ahead of itself. As Fubo scales their new sports betting business and more countries and states make sports betting legal, we should see Fubo ramping up revenue growth significantly. Of course their is a risk to all this as it is very costly to scale both businesses that Fubo operates. Thus, their financial results will give us an idea of how they've been growing and if they can maintain the level of growth they've seen in the past.

Note - main points are bolded

# Important Points to Address

* Revenue was up 83% YoY as advertising revenue grew to $29 million (up 133% YoY) and subscription revenue increased 73% to $230.7 million. As we can see from the numbers, this company is growing at a fast clip. Although the revenue growth they reported is impressive, when looking at their balance sheet they still reported an operating loss of roughly $480 million which was a drastic increase from the prior year which came in at $39 million. Additionally, as this business has scaled they saw their operating expenses jump from $43 million in 2019 to $698 million in 2020 and their goodwill reach $478 million. What these numbers show me is that while this company is growing fast, much of that growth isn't necessarily organic. They spent $63 million on advertising in 2020, while only spending $491,000 in 2019. Also, their general and administrative expenses jumped from $13 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020. While some investors may argue that this business is taking on significant costs short-term so they can succeed in the long-term, I'm worried that heavy competition will slow down their growth. One final thing to note about their expenses is that currently they're losing money on the subscription plans that they offer as their subscriptions revenue was $184 million for 2020, while their subscriber related expenses totaled $204 million. Fubo is up against some strong competitors such as Google with their YouTube TV platform, Sling, Roku, and other streaming services. In the future, we'll see how those expenses change in relation to their revenue as they scale their new sports gambling business.
* Fubo reported reaching 547,880 subscribers in 2020 which was a result of them growing their subscriber base by 261,754 subscribers. As they scaled their subscriber base, average revenue per paying user increased by 17% YoY to $62.84 and total content hours streamed grew 82% YoY to 544.9 million hours. These numbers are impressive as well, but I question how much of that growth was a result of the Covid lockdowns. 2021 is the important year we're going to have to pay attention to in order to get an idea of how this company operates in more 'normal' times.
* The final things I want to mention about Fubo's finances has to do with their current ratio and goodwill. Fubo reported current asset and liabilities of $156 and $227 million respectively, which puts their current ratio at 0.6. For any company to have a current ratio of 0.6 is worrisome in my eyes. Additionally, if you go a bit down their balance sheet you will notice that their goodwill is $478 million. Goodwill arises when one company purchases another. Goodwill is an intangible asset that is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of one company's liabilities from the amount the acquiring company pays for it. The amount of goodwill we're seeing with Fubo is quite high considering their total assets would drop by 50% if they didn't measure it.

# Recent Developments/Acquisitions

* In January of 2021, Fubo announced that they will be acquiring the sports betting and iGaming company Vigtory. The CEO David Gandler stated that, ""We don't see wagering as simply an add-on product to fuboTV. Instead, we believe there is a real flywheel opportunity with streaming video content and interactivity."" I agree with this move made by the CEO as betting is a great compliment to their sports-first TV streaming platform. Fubo's sportsbook is expected to be released sometime mid 2021 and they could see adoption in three states by the end of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out considering the heavy competition in the sports betting market. Some of the biggest names in the sports betting market include DraftKings Inc (DKNG), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Bragg Gaming Group (BRGGF), and more.
* In April of 2021, Fubo announced they were acquiring the exclusive live streaming rights to the South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches. CEO David Gandler said, ""By offering the best of South American soccer in advance of Qatar 2022, we are further differentiating FuboTV’s sports-first content portfolio enabling us to engage with more consumers than ever before.” Once again, I agree with the CEO and this move highlighted his dedication to making Fubo a sports streaming giant. This deal will help Fubo's brand name as this company will be advertising to millions of viewers. David is coming into the sports streaming market aggressively and investors will be awaiting to see how this acquisition will play out financially.
* In December of 2020, Fubo announced that they acquired Balto Sports. This deal marked Fubo's first move into the online wagering market. At the time the CEO was quoted saying, ""We believe there are significant synergies between consumers who enjoy wagering and our subscribers who enjoy streaming live sports, creating a flywheel opportunity. As we’ve previously expressed, one of our goals with wagering is to expand our total available market (TAM) by developing another important revenue stream for fuboTV, as we are doing with our growing ad sales business."" While I don't doubt the strong connection between sports wagering and Fubo's subscribers that enjoy streaming live sports, I question if the ad revenue investors are expecting will come to fruition.
* In April of 2020, Fubo announced the closing of their merger with the sports focused virtual entertainment company FaceBank Group. The CEO of Fubo had said, ""With today’s closing, fuboTV is well-positioned to redefine the virtual MVPD space. Technology-driven cable TV replacement services are more important than ever, especially at this time when people are staying safe at home watching television for needed information, entertainment and escape.” FaceBank is quite an interesting company and developed some unique projects such as the virtual Michael Jackson show at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. This deal not only marked an interesting point in the development of Fubo, but gave the company access to $100 million in funding in the form of a revolving line of credit. I wonder as to how Fubo will leverage the virtual reality and live-entertainment technology that they now control.

# Management

CEO - **David Gandler**

David was appointed as the CEO and director of Fubo in April 2020. He has been part of the team since 2015 when Fubo was simply a streaming soccer service. Prior to his role at Fubo, Gandler worked in the advertising industry for over 15 years at companies such as Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales, and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media. David has won a number of awards which includes *Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs* (2019), *Variety's Dealmakers* (2020,2019), and *Broadcasting & Cable's Power 100* (2017). David's vision for what Fubo could become is interesting and the first of its kind. Looking forward I hope to see Gandler scale this company and integrate their acquisitions successfully. Undoubtedly, David has a grand vision for what could become one of the largest sports betting and streaming companies.

Co-Founder/CMO - **Alberto Horihuela**

Alberto is the co-founder and chief marketing officer at FuboTV and is in charge of their branding, user engagement and retention, and overall marketing vision. Prior to his co-founding of FuboTV, Alberto was head of Latin America at DramaFever (a video streaming provider). Alberto has an entrepreneurial spirit as he also co-founded Primerad Network, a digital video advertising company that connected brand marketers to Latin American audiences. In addition to his experience in marketing and entrepreneurship, Horihuela worked as an economist and analyst at Morgan Stanley and DeMatteo Monness. Both Gandler and Horihuela have extensive experience in marketing, entrepreneurship, and media to which should serve this company well going forward.

Management not mentioned: Simone Nardi (CFO), Mike Berkley (CPO), and Gina Sheldon (general counsel).

# What could go wrong

**Fubo can't keep up with the competition** \- As previously stated, Fubo is up against some heavy competition. AT&T TV provides more channels at the highest subscription level, but Fubo still offers more sports. Also , FuboTV's DVR only lets you record 250 hours of content while AT&T TV lets you record 500 hours of content. YouTube TV and Sling TV are two other competitors that are well equipped to steal market share from Fubo. The main differences I see between Fubo and the rest of the pact have to do with cost and product focus. Sling provides the cheapest plan which starts at $35 and is compatible with many of the existing streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, etc. In terms of the rest of the cohort, they all provide plans that are priced similarly. In terms of the products they offer, Sling, YouTube TV, and AT&T TV haven't differentiated themselves like Fubo. When it comes down to it, sports fans should gravitate to FuboTV as they provide the largest sports network. We'll have to see how this all plays out in the coming years to get to know which companies emerge as the leaders.

**Fubo fails to turn a profit** \- While this risk factor applies to any company that isn't profitable, it's important to highlight how early this company is to having a profitable business model. In their last earnings for the twelve months ended December 31st, Fubo posted $184 million of subscription revenue and $204 million in subscriber related expenses. Thus, this company is not making money on their services and I can't quite predict when or if this company will be profitable any time soon. That's not to say Fubo is a terrible service, but rather their financial standing isn't one that currently strikes me as sustainable.

# What we want to see in the future

**Contribution margin increasing** \- As noted in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results, this company's contribution margin for 2020 was 10.1%. The contribution margin is the difference between subscriber revenue and what it costs Fubo to provide subscribers their service (ARPU - ACPU). While the contribution margin for this company sounds reasonable, the problem comes in when you factor expenses. Expenses such as sales and marketing, depreciation, technology and development, and a few others are hindering this company substantially from making a profit. Once you factor all the expenses of Fubo, they came in at an operating loss of $479 million. What we need to see from Fubo these next five years as they scale is them being able to at-least report a positive income from operations. Let's also remember that Fubo has a recurring revenue business model which means it is predictable and reliable.

**Fubo scales their sports gambling business** \- While this point is rather obvious, I wanted to note a few things about this side of Fubo's business so we can better understand it. Fubo has yet to roll out their sports betting business but they, ""expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year."" Certainly this is an exciting direction that this company is headed in. Although, we have no sort of guidance as to how this sports betting business will perform. CEO David Gandler was quoted saying, “We not only expect sports wagering to become a new line of business and source of revenue, but we also expect that it will increase user engagement on fuboTV resulting in higher ad monetization, better subscriber retention and reduced subscriber acquisition costs.” I like the way that David is thinking, but simply liking the idea doesn't make it a success. I can imagine investors will be eagerly watching how this venture performs in the first year of its integration. As for now, we don't really know what to expect.

# Analyst expectations

1. Predicted revenue range for 2021: $465.03 – 480.44 million (growth of roughly 110%)
2. Predicted earnings per share range for 2021 (EPS): $(2.5) – (0.82)

# TLDR

Fubo's vision to be a digital entertainment giant primarily focused on sports is innovative and unheard of. Their recent acquisitions of Vigtory and Balto Sports shows their commitment to making their goal a reality. While the CEO is thinking big, his ideas aren't translating well onto Fubo's financial statements. Their expenses have gone up at the same rate as their revenue has and that worries me. Additionally, this company isn't in the best cash position with $134 million. It's important to note that this company is still early in the process of what they're trying to accomplish and **I'll be keeping a close eye on how they perform this next yea**r. Their recurring revenue business model will surely serve them well in the future as it is predictable and reliable. You'll notice that the discounted cash flow is missing from this post and that is because forecasting this company's future growth is extremely difficult without some sort of idea as to what we can expect. As of right now, to put a price on this company is quite difficult.   


**In conclusion, I'll be watching Fubo's earnings this next year to get an idea of where this company is headed and if it's worth starting a position.**

I have the product and it’s fine. I literally have no issues with it and the app genuinely surprised me, the quality on matches was way better than I expected. Anybody that’s had issues always complains about buffering but doesn’t realize that it has nothing to do with Fubo and everything to do with the channel you’re on.

mxn1g1,,wallstreetbets,post,1619280692,"HUYA DD Round 2 WTF ARE THESE NUMBERSI recently did a HUYA DD post and I recommend reading that one first here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mx7xxg/will\_huya\_print\_tendies/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mx7xxg/will_huya_print_tendies/)

This post will make papa Burry and DFV proud. The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. 

https://preview.redd.it/3se5sge395v61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca701e6aec738f0c3c6223162bc1c9b030b2ba7

I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huya/institutional-holdings)

You will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the float)

https://preview.redd.it/evbe7l9i95v61.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76db8d2fe90767a78cbbe271b1399bda533d5fd

Per my previous DD post and per the above screen shot 34.4% of the float is shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491 gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get 11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has 11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us retail gamblers.

Practically the entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely shorted. The fundamentals are the prettiest thing I've ever seen when it comes to analyzing stocks.

I know most of WSB is in US, where covid is old news. But you guys should read up on what's happening in India. Look at their covid cases graph, it's going parabolic

https://preview.redd.it/q4igen4um2v61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f0ecc6d7d4857f483af5184cceef96775a06795

[Hospitals are running out oxygen,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56851265) and the government is considering diverting industrial oxygen supplies to hospitals. What does this mean? It means that all industries that uses oxygen will be shut down. What industries uses oxygen?

\- it's used for cutting and welding, so all things like automotive, manufacturing, etc

\-it's used for combustion processes in metal production, so that will interrupt raw material productions (India's major metals productions are Iron and Steel)

&#x200B;

Basically a huge death wave will be coming, and a lot of the industry will be shutdown not just due to lockdowns, but also shortage of oxygen. Meanwhile India ETFs like $INDA are pretty much near all time highs.

You might think vaccines will be the saving grace, but unfortunately the population of india and lack of resources will make vaccinating the indian population a huge task that can't be done quickly. US has 3 of the 4 major vaccines and got 200m doses in \~100 days. India has 1.4 B people, even if they can vaccinate at the US rate, it will take 700 days to get 1 dose on everyone.",

mxlg2s,,wallstreetbets,post,1619275789,"DD on HYPRO (HydrogenPro) hydrogen company. Massive growth opportunities.Here is some DD on HYPRO. I hope to hear your thoughts on this, in my opinion, very bullish company.

1. HYPRO specialises in large-scale hydrogen production (100MW). They are in the midst of demonstrating their new patented technology which takes the efficiency of hydrogen production up to 94% compared to the rest of the hydrogen industry that is lagging behind at 80%. This technology is expected to be ready for the markets in 2022. They will have the best technology in the hydrogen sector. Massive. The EU is funding companies that are able to demonstrate efficient hydrogen production in the scale of 100MW production plants. HYPRO has applied for this funding and decisions concerning the funding will come this June. HYPROs technology will take the dollar price of producing a kilogram of hydrogen to 1,2dollars compared to EUs goal of finding someone who can produce it for 2,5€/kg of hydrogen. Almost hard to believe..
2. In Q4 of 2020 HYPRO made an operating profit, which is pretty unheard of in the hydrogen industry. Everyone else is taking losses.
3. HYPRO has no debt.
4. HYPRO just signed a deal with Hynion about supplying hydrogen to 30 hydrogen fueling stations that will be built in Scandinavia in the coming years. Hundreds of trucks delivering goods will be charged in these stations. HYPRO and Hynion in collaboration are the only ones providing hydrogen fueling stations in the near future and will have an advantage on everyone else.
5. HYPRO is in a huge dip and hasn´t soared 1000% like some other companies like PLUG.
6. They are helping energy giant Repsol to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. They are working on a 100MW hydrogen plant in Spain and many more projects may follow. 3 other plants are being constructed, 2 of which are in the US and 1 in France.

&#x200B;

Here is their most recent report on their website where most of my claims are from: [https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf](https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf)

Positions: 

1049 shares with an average of 46,76NOK

Do your now research and let me know what you think! It's still a small company but to me that means a lot of growth potential. Weather you think hydrogen is the future or not, the EU has lots of plans in the hydrogen sector and the price of it is coming down fast. Up to 6GWs of hydrogen plants are to be built by 2024. HYPRO could take a good portion of that. The steel industry will also want to get rid of emissions when the price of pollution becomes greater than the price of switching to hydrogen.",

Me again 🌈🐻, if you didn't see my first two posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maa6g3/fsr_is_worth_0_a_share/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/melf8c/fsr_updated_price_target_421/)), I have serious doubts about Fisker as a company.   Just wanted to pop back in with a couple updates.  My goal of these posts is to make sure that anyone investing in this company has a full grasp of the risks.  In their 10K that was (finally) filed, I grabbed two important pieces of information that I hadn't really discussed in depth.   I'll try to keep this short this time.

**Manufacturing Agreement:**

First, is that the reported deal with Magna International to manufacture the Ocean is not actually finalized.  It's more of an memorandum of understanding with a basic outline of terms.  So, the clock is ticking on their Q4 2022 production date, and they still don't have detailed terms with the manufacturer.  Who is also supposed to be performing the majority of the engineering, design, and testing of the car itself.

Might want to get moving on that.

**Manufacturing Agreement Terms:**

The terms of the above agreement are that Magna will get a series of warrants for FSR stock that are exerciseable upon three main milestones: (1) preliminary production spec, (2) detailed manufacturing agreement, (3) start of production. If fully exercised, these warrants amount to 6% ownership in Fisker.

Let that sink in.  If Magna produces a single Ocean, they own 6% of the company.  This (maybe?) makes sense for a long term strategic partnership, but Fisker has already announced that they want Foxconn to make their second car.  How much ownership does Foxconn get?  And if they make a third car?  Does everyone just get 6%?  So of course Magna made that deal.  No downside risk, and the upside is 6% of an EV company.

&#x200B;

As I said in a comment on my previous post,  I""ll be keeping an eye on May.  They had announced they'd have a production version of the Ocean ready for the LA Auto Show that was supposed to be in May 2021.  The show has been moved to November (Covid-19), but it will be telling if they debut a production ready Ocean on that original timeline, or if dates are already slipping.

I don't think this company leadership has any idea what it's doing.

&#x200B;

Current Positions: None.  Intend to scale into puts if the price moves higher, but right now it's just in a slow bleed/consolidation that burns Theta.",
