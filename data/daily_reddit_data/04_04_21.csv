lv5dlb,gpbcy3e,stocks,comment,1614617395,"Swedish investor here. Been investing for about four years now. I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.

# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.
*****
> The U.S. Labor Department’s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.
*****
> The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute’s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> “Literally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We’re coming off a low base,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks — unless interest rates rise too quickly.
*****
> Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.
*****
> On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.
*****
> The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.
*****
> The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.
*****
> # All eyes on earnings
> “The macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That will be the next thing to turn to.”
*****
> He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.
*****
> First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.
*****
> Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.
*****
> “Approximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,” noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
> Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.
*****
> “In each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.
*****
> “Our work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2½–3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,” Golub wrote.
*****
> # April is far from cruelest month
Aside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.
*****
> Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that’s constructive for stocks.
*****
> The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&P 500, trading on the CBOE.
*****
> Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.
*****
> Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.
*****
> “The bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.
*****
> “April is usually good. It’s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It’s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.
*****
> The market enters the “sell in May” period during the second quarter. The market adage, “sell in May and go away,” is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.
*****
> “In that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,” Stovall said. “Tech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
> The producer price index — which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output — will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.
*****
> As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
> Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.
*****
> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.

> # Stocks Love April

> “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Mark Twain

> What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Just how strong has April been lately? “I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Other than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:

> * Since 1950 it is the second best month
> * The past 20 years it is the best month
> * The past 10 years it is the second best month
> * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12

> Taking it a step further, here’s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.

> # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After

> Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.

> # A Humble Victory Lap

> It has been a little over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It’s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.

> It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:

> Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie—a lesson we always keep in mind.

> “Few on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‘what have you done for me lately’ industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.”

> Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.

> # Turn Off, Tune Out

> The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.

> Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.

> Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**

> In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**

> At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.

> # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.

> As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**

> That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**

> As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.

> # Stocks and Inflation

> As we continue LPL Research’s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow’s blog, where we’ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.

> Looking at S&P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “You can’t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that’s under control is a tailwind for stocks,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.”

> Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> The inflation question is one that isn’t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn’t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.

[https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/](https://www.mining.com/copper-price-lifted-by-us-stimulus-china-inventory-squeeze/)

Copper prices rose on 8th Feb as optimism around a US stimulus raised hopes of higher demand for metals and a recovery in the world’s biggest economy.

The copper price rose as much as 1.3% to $3.6745 ($8,100 a tonne) on the Comex market on Monday, with March delivery contracts back within shouting distance of multi-year highs hit early in January.

The metal has rallied nearly 90% since the depth of the pandemic in March.

Thinning inventories

The rise in copper prices is underpinned by thinning inventories that pointed to higher demand for the industrial metal.

“Inventories are still quite low on exchanges. That gives good indication that manufacturing demand for copper is present and that its not just a speculative story,” Nitesh Shah, an analyst at investment manager WisdomTree, [told Reuters.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)

In China, the world’s top consumer, copper inventories normally accumulate in the run up to the Lunar New Year as businesses close for the week-long festivities.

But this year, Chinese inventories have [dropped to near decade lows ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-prices-lifted-by-inventory-squeeze-2021-02-08)on robust demand from factories, which are maintaining high operating rates due to shortened shutdown periods and tighter travel restrictions for workers.

Meanwhile, effects of the [coronavirus pandemic on copper supply](https://www.mining.com/web/worlds-copper-mines-struggle-to-recover-from-covid-19-andy-home/) continues to be felt. In what was supposed to be a year of supply growth, global mined output during the first 10 months of 2020 were 0.5% lower compared to 2019 levels, according to the International Copper Study Group (ICSG).

In Peru, the world’s second-biggest producer, copper output plunged 12.5% to 2.15 million tonnes in 2020, the country’s Energy and Mines Ministry said on [8th Feb](https://www.mining.com/web/peru-reports-sharp-drop-in-2020-copper-production-due-to-pandemic/).

Copper miners gain

Despite copper prices hitting a slump in the second half of January, the world’s top copper producers have continued to rally this year after spectacular gains in 2020.

**Shares of BHP, the largest publicly traded copper company**, are up 6% year-to-date.

Copper, like most commodities, has been a cyclical investment whose demand ebbs and flows with economic cycles. Traditionally, roughly half of all copper demand has come from new building construction and infrastructure, China has been the single biggest market by far. With many global economies in or entering recovery phases, cyclical demand is on the upswing. 

Green initiatives around the world offer a secular tailwind as well. The European Green Deal, President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate plan, and China’s target of carbon neutral by 2060 all point to increasing incremental demand for copper. 

Although mining stocks have in many cases quadrupled since their March 2020 lows, many names are still trading below their previous highs, and at a time when fundamentals are improving.

Take [Freeport-McMoRan](https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/fcx), $FCX, a Phoenix-based company whose business is roughly 70% copper, 20% gold, and 10% other. The stock plummeted to $7 a share during the selloff last spring and has since recovered to a recent $30. But it is still about half what it was at previous highs of around $60 in early 2008 and 2011.  

The big news on copper last month was regarding $RIO and the Mongolian situation.

Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia's government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the OyuTolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported.

[https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep\_id:3650](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/mongolia-seeks-more-tax-revenue-from-rio-copper-mine-expansion--source-2021-02-09/rep_id:3650)

Many thought this was potentially bad news for $RIO, but it appears it's about working out a little more tax dollars for the government and a deal will be struck.

**The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world’s biggest copper mines**

Global copper demand

As mentioned above, it’s not likely that copper demand will slow down in 2021.

In the US, new home and home renovation demand spiked since the pandemic started, along with electronics demand. Analysts at CitiBank expect the copper market to shift into a deficit in the second half of the year with a minor surplus overall for 2021, Reuters reported. They also forecast deficits in 2022 and 2023.

The US Census Bureau and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development reported building permits in December increased by 4.5% compared to November and 17.3% above the December 2019 rate. Privately owned housing continued to increase in December, rising by 5.8% from the previous month and by 5.2% compared to December 2019. The uptrend started in September 2020.

China will continue to play an important role in the copper market. The country accounts for about half of global primary consumption, which is then used to manufacture export goods.

According to the aforementioned Reuters report, appliances output also increased in China. Similarly, China’s refrigerators exports went up by 45% in December 2020 compared to December 2019. During the same period, exports of microwave ovens rose by 35%.

Indonesian copper smelter

Indonesian politician Luhut Pandjaitan, said Freeport-McMoRan, $FCX and Tsingshan Holding Group reached a $2.8 billion deal to build a copper smelter in Indonesia’s Weda Bay. The smelter would process copper concentrate from the Grasberg mine. Luhut did not report a timeline, per the report.

“The smelter will produce copper pipes and wires of which output can be worth $10 billion or more,” the minister reportedly told IDX Channel. The smelter will aim to produce copper products to be used in lithium battery components. Indonesia is working to build an electric vehicle supply chain, as it is also a major nickel producer.

 As you can see in the picture, I have tried to do my own analysis of Apple (Yeah I know it is mainstream, but it was mostly to get the method right).

I have   tried to calculate the intrinsic value based on the EPS TTM and the Free cash flow, and as you can see, I get two different results (as I   expected I would, although the factors are the same). The stats are   taken from Yahoo finance and MSN money, and I know both methods contain   quite a lot of ""guesstimates"".

My question is therefore, what method do you find to be most reliable?

mj780x,gt8lpem,stocks,comment,1617452321,"There isn’t a most reliable method for every company in every industry. 

Cash flow valuations won’t work in non cash flowing businesses (valuing start ups, or companies that have yet to be cash flow even though they have good growth prospects). 

PE valuations can only value a company with earnings and values it at what the current market values the company earnings. Again this sort of misses current unprofitable growth companies. 

I usually have some sort of valuation methods that Cash Flows > Income > Sales > TAM. The lower you go the less accurate you’ll be and the closer to a start up the company you’re looking at will be.",['UPS']
mj780x,gt8ovox,stocks,comment,1617454603,"I want to point out that your free cash flow estimate for 2018 is approximately in the ballpark of what AAPL actually traded at. 

You plugged in a 35% margin of safety. You guesstimated some future cash flows. If I plug in a slightly different margin of safety and different future cash flows, I will end up with a different valuation.

The current stock price is the last price at which 

(1) Somebody in the market thought it was worth buying at that price, and had money to do so.

(2) Somebody in the market was willing to sell at that price and they had the shares to do so.

That trade occurred because (1) and (2) had a different valuation to begin with.

In other words, if AAPL held the exact same value for everyone all the time, nobody would be buying and selling once some equilibrium is reached.

The other side to the valuation is how much you can extract from owning a share. Assume a company X provides $4 dividend this year and the lowest return rate you will accept is 4%. So then, the most you would pay for it is $100. Now if there is another company who wants to acquire X, they will look at future cash flows and determine what price to pay for the company. Because they can extract value from future cash flows, they will use the future cash flow model and come up with a price > 100$. For example, say they price it at $150.

So, you can extract value only up to $100 per share, but if you believe someone else can extract value at $150 per share - you might be able to buy a share at any price below $150 and sell it to whoever can extract value at $150 and make some profit along the way.

In other words, it’s not enough to just pick a model for valuing your company. You should think about how much you can extract from it, either through dividends or by guessing what price you will be able to sell it at (even better if you can guess why someone will buy it from you at that price in the future).

Tesla delivered a great bit of news Friday. The electric vehicle pioneer posted a healthy quarterly increase in deliveries, a number more than double 2020's first-quarter total.

Investors had been wary of the figures -- not because of demand or competition, but because of the global automotive chip shortage. Their worries turned out to be overblown.

Tesla delivered about 185,000 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 181,000 in the fourth-quarter of 2020 and about 88,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020. Year-over-year growth is more than 100%.

Wall Street estimates ranged from roughly 162,000 to about 172,000. Estimates had fallen from more than 180,000 deliveries, mainly because of the chip shortage.

Tesla didn't mention the chip shortage in its report. It did point out, however, that the Model Y has been received in China. The company began manufacturing the Y in China a few months ago. .

The result keeps Tesla on track to deliver the Wall Street consensus of roughly 800,000 vehicles in 2021, up about 60% year over year. Tesla didn't provide 2021 delivery guidance, but didn't that it was targeting 50% average annual unit delivery growth for the foreseeable future.",['TSLA']

Yes this is a fast moving industry but it's not fast enough that they would need to rebalance every single day. No industry moves that fast.

Holdings would change as companies come into and exit the 3D printing industry. In the latter case, this would be because a company went under, changed their focus, etc. You can check the prospectus to understand when and on what terms these changes are made.

-Tesla reaches scale production of Model 3 in min 2018, leading to huge Model 3 Sales as it worked through pre-sale backlog

-But by 2019, production capacity outstripped domestic demand, leaving Tesla with excess Model 3s it needed to sell - so it started exporting Fremont production despite its own overseas factories already under construction


-During this period, two CAOs one CFO and several GCs were replaced and Tesla restated its financials based on revised revenue recognition relating to lease sales.  Red flags abound.

-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.


-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. 


-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty's ""put"" is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.


-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an ""Appreciating Asset"" based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make


-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.


-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla ""Other"" international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.


-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.

If production outstripped demand in 2019, how did they manage to sell almost 2x as many cars in 2020 while overall automotive market demand was down anywhere between 20 and 50%? What a ridiculous statement to make without any kind of proof.

Business activity has returned to close to normal levels in much of the company despite the restrictions, with a tracker by Jeffries indicating that activity is at 93.5% of its pre-pandemic level.

Data from Homebase shows that employees working and hours worked both gained sharply over the past month, with significant improvements in both hospitality and entertainment. Those have been the hardest-hit sectors, but have improved over the past two months as governments have loosened up on some of the harshest restrictions on activity.

At the same time, manufacturing is enjoying a boom, with an Institute for Supply Management gauge of activity in the sector hitting its highest level since late 1983 in March.

The pace of gains combined with the unprecedented level of government stimulus has kindled worries about inflation, though Federal Reserve officials say any increases will be temporary.

The Fed is keeping a close eye on the jobs data, but policymakers have said repeatedly that even with the recent improvements the labor market is nowhere near a point that would push the central bank into raising interest rates.",['DOW']

mhvteb,,stocks,post,1617285307,"I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned.Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.

I had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.

To celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.

Here's the first one:

**I can't predict the stock market.**

*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.

You can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:

* **Direction:** 65% correct
* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%
* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%

I was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.

Part of the problem was this:

**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**

When J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.

I wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month

[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)

J. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.

**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**

I've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: ""Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?""

One thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.

I saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: ""Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?"" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. 

**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**

One of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the ""bond yield"". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.

It never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.

I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:

* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March
* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.
* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.
* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech

**... but sometimes it is.**

That doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.

Another huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.

This story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.

People really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.

**I still think the stock market can be predicted**

When I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.

They probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.

Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.

If you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.

[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)","['MSFT', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ', 'AMZN']"

I will admit I haven’t done enough research to back this up but it seems extremely unlikely bind yields are not statistically significant to stock prices.

mj8nwl,,stocks,post,1617457077,"Why you should invest in Index onlyAs a disclaimer, this is purely my opinion and i am not a financial advisor. But i strongly believe the majority of us should simply dump all of their cash into VTI or VOO and do nothing else. Here is why:


* I strongly believe that 99% of us cannot time the market. If you do anything else that invest for 10+ years, you are competing against bots and teams of pros, and will likely lose money. Might be lucky in the short term, but eventually you will get burned.


* Secondly, assuming that you invest for the long term, if you look over a very long time frame, the % of companies that actually would be a good investment over a 30 years period is very small. Do the test and check random companies, created 40 years ago, most of them would have been terrible investments, or even went bankrupt. The long term profits of the stock market is actually created by a small % of companies, and guessing which ones will be successful is often more luck than skills.


* Indexing is also way less stressful than anything else. If there is a crash, you can be confident VTI will recover, and you can very safely DCA into it with more cash. VTI is not going bankrupt. We can't say the same about random stock tickers. Even giants fall sometimes. Its also far less time consuming. No research to do, no news to check, just DCA into it whenever you can.



* The profits you can make using this strategy is deceptively high. With my 50K salary and a frugal life style, and abusing RRSP, i am able to save around 25K a year. If you use an investment calculator, starting with 0$, and putting 2K a month in VTI, assuming 10% profits a year, after 15 years, you will have 830K! You do not need to guess the next amazon to become rich.



* Please note that i don't think that its terrible to allow a small % of the portfolio to more speculative plays. I myself have some ARKG shares. But you have to keep these as a small % of the portfolio, and avoid too aggressively DCA into it. If it falls, it falls. But keep in mind even thought these plays are beating the SP500 during a bull run, they could be in a lot of pain during the next crash. Heck, in February a small correction had a lot of them down 30%.",['AMZN']

mj8nwl,gt8w08n,stocks,comment,1617459143,"Investing in an index has nothing to do with timing the market. If anyone can time the market, the last thing you’d want to do is to time on when to invest into an index (why would you want to time the bottom of the average when you can time the bottom of something that can yield multiple times the average). 

Investing in an index is for diversification/ protecting wealth and for people who don’t want to learn and the stress of holding individual stocks. 

If you’re investing in individual stocks, you aren’t directly “competing” against pros. Realistically speaking, when you invest in individual stocks, you want to be outperforming/ beating the average, otherwise you’d be better off just investing in the average (index). 

Personally speaking, investing and researching stocks is a hobby of mine. I love being about to do the research, analysis and calculating projections and giving price targets to make buy and sell decisions. Sure I can use a paper account, but the feeling of being “correct” is just not there when you use fake money. You have no sense of what’s to lose so you can just recklessly and blindly buy whatever you want and just say how smart you are because out of the 1000 stocks you bought, 1 of them yielded a x1000 return. Managing capital is fun to me I personally don’t recommend everyone to do it. The same reason as to why you shouldn’t tell everyone to just invest in an index.",

I disagree with this part. Picking individual stocks should be more profitable, if done correctly.

Picking random companies won't necessarily be as profitable as sticking with an index, but you don't need to pick random companies. Statistics like ""most people don't beat the market"" don't tend to separate the data by attempted strategy. Buffett and Lynch both insist people can beat the market if they pick intelligently.

That's misleading because GDP is an annual figure, where as market cap is a valuation of all shares combined, generally valued based on discounted cash flow over several decades.

So I absolutetly love using the weekly chart to draw my support and resistance levels

My question is in regards to the daily and intraday time frames, let say the weekly resistance is at $10 and the daily or intraday time period actually brakes this level and is now climbing up, would it be stupid to jump in since the week isn't over therefore the weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 therefore I shouldn't jump in.

Summary
-

Should I stick with one time period, so if I draw s/r using weekly, I shouldn't ever check other periods, my entry/exit should be strictly using weekly? 

OR is it okay to use weekly and daily together but not use intraday? So weekly resistance at $10, and daily closes above $10, while weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 yet, wouldn't be a good idea to jump in because by the time the weekly candle closes above $10 I would have missed out on the run

mi8p2x,,stocks,post,1617322503,"PLTR is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is my bullish thesis.First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more ""abstract"" and less known factors.

First of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: “We are going to deliver the world’s best software with the world’s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that’s worth to them. And I think you’ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.” -Karp the day they went public

**A great company is not necessarily a great investment.**

miyxq9,,stocks,post,1617414927,"Why is a share price on the market higher than value of the company portion it represents?In a very basic sense, stock is purchased for the ownership of a company. It’s price grows on the market following supply and demand, and as such the price of a single share may rise as the value of a company rises and more people want to buy that share than those willing to sell.

But why is the portion of a company granted by that share worth less than what it’s paid for?

Suppose a company has a book value of $180M and has 100M shares outstanding on the market for $5. Its market cap, which encompasses its intangibles and growth potential is nearly 3x as much as its book value, signaling the market believes the company is and will continue doing well (in theory).

Now since a share indicates owning a portion of the company, a single share in this company is worth 0.00000001%, or if the company liquidated its assets today, $1.8; so why would somebody want to buy a share of a company for more than what that share is worth? Is the delta between its intrinsic value and the market value the “mark up” for the current share holder to earn for giving their position away?

This brings up the question, if you exclude capital appreciation from the equation, if the share price on the market is more than the intrinsic value it losses at purchase, the hope would be that over time the value of the company grows such that the shares intrinsic value eventually exceeds what you paid for it, right?",
miyxq9,gt7ep4o,stocks,comment,1617415803,"Yes. When you pay for a company you are paying for its future value determined by revenue, earnings, etc. The exact opposite happens with a lot of companies where the share price is less than BVPS (book value per share). That’s because people are predicting that the company will be worth a lower valuation in the future usually because of lower revenue, lower earnings, possible bankruptcy, etc.",
miyxq9,gt7svb7,stocks,comment,1617424942,"Y'all are over complicating. An equity share is not so much a ""piece of a company"" as a claim to a share of a future stream of earnings. If the company does not return a portion of those earnings to the shareholders as yield, then the excess earnings should increase the value of the shares. This is why the price to earnings ratio is more widely used than the price to book in share price evaluation.",

mits4h,gt6z1jm,stocks,comment,1617406652,"I'm not sure if you're aware (apologies if you are), but the contents of an ETF still have to be publicly traded companies.  So the pub opening up on the corner will not be reflected in any ETF, unless it's a chain that's part of a corporation (say, a McDonald's corporate-owned restaurant, for example).

I'm not personally aware of any ETFs that focus specifically on food and restaurants, but you could look into individual companies that are in that business.  McDonald's is one.  QSR is another one (they have Burger King, KFC, etc.)  I'm not sure how active they are in the UK, that'd be something for you to research if you'd like.

I decided to do a quick google search and came up with [these ETFs](https://investorplace.com/2020/07/there-arent-many-food-etfs-but-here-are-a-few-to-consider/).  The first one looks like it's got some restaurants, like Chipotle and Wingstop.  Again, though, not sure if those are in the UK at all.  Be careful though because it looks like a lot of them contain brands that you can buy from home... Pepsi, Beyond Meat, etc.  So not exactly a reopening play.

mite0k,,stocks,post,1617396813,"Looking for diversification advice!Hello there!

As the title suggests, I'm currently looking for sectors in which to invest other than Tech (I'm already quite tech heavy). 

I'm 21, I have read quite a bit about this and with 2 years of experience in this world, prefered to start early because ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", with a moderate risk tolerance. 
I understand the benefit of being diversified, but I personally think that knowing the sector that you are invested in gives 95% of the time better results than ""diversifying for the sake of doing it"", that's why I went tech heavy for a start.

I have no preference between value or growth, but I value some kind of stability AND dividends (aiming for looong term holding). 
150% a month plays are nice, but I prefer avoiding the -60% that comes the following week / month. 

My current holdings are:

26% TSM (Semiconductor manufacturing)

26% AAPL (Tech)

24% NVDA (Tech / Semic / IA)

24% LOGI (Computer peripherials)


EDIT: That's only taking the stocks % into account. Cash makes for ~40% of the portfolio right now.

The portfolio took a beating last month, but It's already well into the green realm. The beating is what showed me that I should consider diversifying to other sectors (after looking at them in depth) for the sake of stability. 

Currently considering: 

Volkswagen (Automotive sector, future safe EV play, nice div., Germany's prefered child)

Blackrock (Financial sector, too-big-to-fall, the ""safest"" I found)

Paypal (FinTech with a foot into the crypto world lately)

And a couple of spanish small caps (I'm from Spain) that I know locally that will grow during the upcoming years. 

Any suggestion of which I should choose, or what sector should I look into? (Green energy might be recovering, but I find it to be still overvalued for an entry point. Got a friend really burned with ICLN's European version, IQQH).

mite0k,gt6ho53,stocks,comment,1617397286,"Not a financial advisor but here’s what I’d do if I were you. I’d trim each of those positions to around 7-8% the total value of your portfolio. Then take the cash you have and grab up some total market ETFs. 40-50% allocation would be your target here. That will increase your diversification.

Then you can take names you like and buy those to 4-5% allocation (keep In mind if the names are in the etf when you calculate the allocation).

So this week we saw DISCB$ made a huge upward spike soaring to a high of 150$. This move was on super low volume and many believe it was a short squeeze, but I see something that makes me suspicious of this

I took a look at a 1 year chart of DISCB$ and I see that around last year this happened too. This stock soared to 103$ from 32$. So what are the chances this happened twice? Well....I don't quite know yet.

2.  Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (LTRPB)

This one is so much more bizarre then Discovery because this upward spike happened to this stock not once or twice, but SIX times in the last year. This stock literally goes from penny status to 100s in the matter of days. The first spike happened in April of last year and it soared to a high of 134$. In June of 2020 it jumped from the 20s to 82$ and in July from 47$ to 74$ dollars. Then then in August of 2020 it soared from 46$ to 69$ dollars and then last month it soared from 31$ to 59$.

- LendingTree ($TREE)
- Overstock ($OSTK)

- Shift Technologies ($SFT) 

I feel like these (with the exception of Shift which is more speculative) have been beaten down more than they deserve to and are tried-and-true examples of companies that are likely to do great in 2021 and beyond. 

However, I have no illusions of what will happen if the tech selloff continues for months, which has been reason for me to hedge a bit. With the S&P roaring ever-higher, I'm not feeling particularly comfortable holding these types of stocks right now.

migc3s,gt4un4w,stocks,comment,1617366410,"I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. 

First let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.

Disclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.

Apple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.

Disney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.

By the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.

The bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.

FAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.

My favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.

Square, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.

Then you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.

People are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? 

Software companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.

I don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.

Happy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well.","['TGT', 'HPE', 'DIS', 'ETSY', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'MU', 'AMZN', 'PYPL']"

I personally use Questrade for everything. The only downside is 4.99$ fees for buying and selling anything other than ETFs. 0$ fees on qualified ETFs though which is nice.

How exactly is real estate investing much better than stock market investing? For example, if I were to put 50K down on a property and take out a mortgage, I might be cash flowing couple hundred bucks after everything is paid each month but if I were to simply invest in a dividend company like O Realty, I would get roughly the same in dividends each month without the hassle. They both have the potential for appreciation too so that argument is a wash.

Also, the mortgage would be paying itself but it would take years to get it fully paid unless you put extra down right? Also what if a tenant doesn’t want to pay or moves out? What happens?

Would love to hear the thoughts of your real estate investors.",

miaixy,gt3n7ds,stocks,comment,1617329686,"Personally I think it’s difficult to compare the two but I’ll try as I invest in both. 

In real estate you are purchasing an asset that in theory should increase in value (given that you purchased in the right area at the right time) so the risk is relatively low. You can take steps to increase the value of this asset by means of renovations and upgrades. And finally you can sell this asset after 2yrs and not pay capital gains taxes. My wife and I do slow “flips” in trendy neighborhoods that we know well and I think it’s both safe and quite profitable. We also put down large down payment and then take out a HELOC to pay for renovations as the interest is tax deductible. The only downside is you need some solid cash in hand to get started.  

On the stock side of things there are of course way more variables. If you are all blue chips with dividends that’s great but a more diversified portfolio likely has some more risk built in. I do my own form “day-ish trading” so my risk is greater but so are my returns (usually and hopefully haha).  The good thing is I find it more fun and I started with a lot less money. The down side is the taxes such and if you miss a move it can quickly cost you money.

mi4cgu,,stocks,post,1617309148,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 1, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 1, 2021**

Stocks rose today, extending gains in another record-setting session. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed above $400 for the first time ever, starting the new quarter with a bang after President Biden announced a new $2 trillion infrastructure proposal.

Today marks the first session of Quarter 2, hopefully putting to rest the volatility that dominated the market last quarter. Historically, the month of April has been good for equity markets, with the SPY gaining an average of 1.51% since 1980.

Heading into Q2, we expect cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks, whose performance is strongly tethered to the health of the broader economy, to continue driving the market higher. The last quarter saw the rotation out of tech and growth stocks as the US economy continues to gradually reopen due to the increased pace in vaccinations. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco agrees, saying “ I think we’re going to see more of the same in terms of market leadership. This is an environment in which the economy is likely to accelerate. And I think that means that we’ll see continued outperformance of areas like energy, like financials, like consumer discretionary, material, industrials — those areas of the stock market that are most sensitive to the economy.”

On Wednesday, President Biden introduced a new proposal called American Jobs Plan. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan includes spending to repair aging roads and bridges, jump-start transit projects, and rebuild school buildings and hospitals. It would also expand electric vehicles, replace all lead pipes and overhaul the nation’s water systems. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).

Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic. As a reminder, US exchanges will be closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CAPL/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CAPL/)

For me, it's all there - reopening play that has not fully been priced in, exposure to rising gasoline prices and demand, consistent and high dividend payer, RSI is stable, MAs are all on point, P/E ratio among the best out there in any industry, uptrend is steady with entry points along the way...

This stock is largely flying under the radar because it gets lumped in with the ET / ETRN / EPD crowd - relatively safe, longer-term energy plays with dividends...which it is.

BUT

It's fairly valued - or even undervalued - moves in a sector that is currently largely accurately priced, has plenty of room to grow as gas prices increase - see CDC travel release today (!) - and you can tell your family you bought it and they'll think you're not a degen from Upcountry playing with stonks like it's the floor at the MGM Grand. 

Daily trading volume is low, so price movements are somewhat stable. Last time it flash dropped in isolation was because they announced a cut to the dividend yield in May 2017. That is unlikely to occur again, and certainly not in 2021.

I see this as the perfect spring and summer accessory for your ROTH IRA brokerage account. Let it ride and get a cool $2 in dividends a share over Q2 - Q4 2021 ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CAPL/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CAPL/dividend/)) - note that the value of these dividends could go up 10% or so with increased earnings due to higher gas prices and convenience store performance. CAPL had paid upwards of $2.40 in dividends a share in 2017.

In February 2020, prior to the COVID crash, they were trading at $19.35 on gas prices of $2.50 a gallon ([https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM\_EPMR\_PTE\_NUS\_DPG&f=W](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)). If they break through 19.35, I think we could see a return to early - mid 2017 share prices. 

Daily trading volume is low, so price movements are somewhat stable. Last time it flash dropped in isolation was because they announced a cut to the dividend yield in May 2017. That is unlikely to occur again, and certainly not in 2021.

This isn't a ""can't lose"" - but the dividend cushion means you could easily take a scalp here of nearly $2.00 a share and break even. If you think there's room to grow in travel - and I believe there is, at least in terms of interstate travel by road - I believe this could be a + $3 - 4 a share play by the holiday travel season when you incorporate dividend yield and stock price increase, which should be wild. 

***TL;DR:*** *CAPL could offer 15 - 30% upside over the next 8 months, with roughly 10% downside protection built in at current share prices due to dividend yields.*","['MGM', 'MAS']"
migwgy,,stocks,post,1617356339,"PSA: [Long story] Be aware of Discord channels that discuss ""stocks tips"" based on ""technical analysis"".So I have joined a Discord channel from roughly November to March, after receiving an invitiation in my Reddit inbox.

The channel was original for free, from November to December. Then it had subscription plans starting from January.

Between November to early February, there was a huge Bull market, so of course most of the guy's stocks tips are correct (he primarily bought bitcoin (GBTC), a few Cathie Woods stocks, SPCE, and also apparently a hugh believer of the SPAC PSTH). Everyone started to kind of ""idolizing"" him, without really realizing the performance was mainly based on a strong market.

His advice was mainly based on ""technical analysis"", drawing channels, support lines, resistance lines, etc. So far so good, as I am also a believer of TA. What got real sketchy was, the two terms he often mentioned are ""chair pattern"" and ""U shape pattern"" which, as far as I know, isn't really a thing from the TA point of view.

Anyway here comes mid Feb and late March where NASDAQ was crashing. A lot of his trade ideas werent working, and what he said was merely ""because the market isn't strong enough"". But quite a few of his trades were really headscratching e.g., he added his position in TLRY when the stock was dropping from $80s to $60s within an hour, asked everyone to buy AQB despite it is not fundamentally strong enough, just ""because Cathie buys it"", and also hard selling PSTH and asked people to buy on dips even when it dropped from $32 to $24 within a few weeks just ""because of Bill Ackman"". None of these actions are, in my view, what a technical trader should have done.

And during the majority of days between Feb and Mar, his trade ideas have gone radio silence. He resurfaced again these few days, posting the +% of certain individual stocks to imply that his trade ideas are really good.

He claimed to have achieve a 400% return in the past twelve months, which is a great one. But last time I checked, SOXL and TQQQ have achieved far better return.

Hindsight is 20/20, but IMO a worthy channel should have asked you to do at least these two things in late January:

1. Ask you to rotate out of tech stocks into ""old economy"" stocks.

2. Recommend you to invest in certain inverse bond ETF (TTT was a great one from late Jan to mid March).

TLRY: Moral of the story: Always be skeptical of paid Discord channels. Good performance may only be a result of a strong Bull market. As good as the guy's result is, his performance may be still far behind certain 3x ETFs.","['MAR', 'NDAQ', 'PSA']"

&#x200B;

From an ""I need some money""-perspective, it doesn't matter which shares you sell, X shares at $Y dollars gets you what you need in cash, now, $(X\*Y). It doesn't matter one tiny bit that the sales proceeds are to pay for 2020 taxes. And any sales gains will count towards 2021 taxes.

From a gains perspective, I'd sell the ones I've made least money on, therefore, owe least taxes on (in 2021), if that includes loses then the loses offset gains.

UNLESS your 2021 tax situation is such that your long term capital gains can be taxed at 0%? Sort term capital gains are taxed as income, get bundled in with income, are subject to standard (or itemized) deductions limits, etc., but basically are taxed at your income tax tiers.  IF your earned/job income and unearned income is below certain thresholds then there might be room under the (long term) capital gains thresholds to not pay taxes on the long term gains. And then I'd sell the long term held shares. A game of juggling your 2021 tax brackets and thresholds, see [https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets](https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/#brackets).

As I will mention a couple of times below, I'm new to investing, so consider this me working through my ideas and please do not take it as financial advice or the absolute truth of things.\]*

So - I don't really love the bull case ""Omg new paradigm, low interest rates, never bet against the USA!"", nor the bear case (predicted 20 of the last 5 recessions). TBH to me it just seems like nobody can ever truly know... imperfect information and what not.

I'm totally new to investing, but I did get my degree in economics. The market is definitely running hot right now, but then again, we can kind of afford it at the moment with all the easy money - the Fed is printing money precisely so that markets are more liquid. This is expected. We're also not totally detached from the fundamentals like we were with the dot com bubble. I mean, MSFT at 32 P/E ratio makes sense taking into account future earnings. You could say it makes sense for most of the S+P.

The problem is that it has to stop at some point. I mean, future earnings could account for the kind of P/Es we have now, but when we start reaching into 40,50, 60... then you're really getting detached from any sort of fundamentals. The other thing to look at is how much leverage is being used. [Right now, it's a lot.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/03/17/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-9-in-february-continues-record-trend)

But again, that's to be expected because borrowing is so cheap right now. This is what the Fed wants. The Fed wants people to borrow, spend, invest, etc. Keep the wheels of the economy spinning.

But everything has limits. At some point the Fed has to pump the brakes on this. They say that's what they will do. But as unemployment is still high and inflation is still below target, they're not there yet.

That raises a couple of questions for me:

1. Will they actually pump the brakes when its time? Or will they continue to keep interest rates low in order to monetize US debt? Low interest rates means it's easier for the US government to pay back its debt. In theory, the Fed is independent of the US government. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist so I do believe the Fed will act independently to raise rates when the time is right. But it's still something we won't know for sure until they actually do it. And there's also a question of *when*. I'm worried that things get too far ahead of fundamentals... ie, the easy money becomes too easy and the Fed loses control of the ship before it is able to act.
2. When they do start pumping the brakes, how will the markets react? It was actually the Bank of Japan trying to slowly put out the speculation fire (by raising rates) that caused the Japan asset bubble to crash, leading to the Lost Decade. There's a real concern, IMO, that the markets cannot sustain these valuations without the Fed's support. As soon as the Fed steps in, people might fear the party is over, panic sets in, and we crash.

So, what am I doing given all this uncertainty? I'm going for a middle-ground solution. I've got about half of my portfolio in a target retirement fund (various index funds) that I've been adding to for a few years, and I've got the other half in individual stocks that are either good, reliable businesses or very defensive stocks. Some are mining stocks in the event of inflation. I'm also holding some dry powder as well as some inflation protected bonds as another place to dump money that isn't cash.

Basically I'm playing the middle ground. If things go well, I will be able to ride the momentum. Not as well as everybody who is 100% in VOO, or 100% in winning tech stocks if they do rally and continue to do so. But I'll still do decently.

If things go poorly, I'll lose more than someone who was 100% defensive or purely in cash, obviously. But I'll also do a whole lot better than anyone who was 100% VOO or 100% tech.

I'm new to investing so take all of this with a grain of salt. Do your own research. But I think my econ degree, plus all of the research I've been doing the past 2 months or so, has given me some level of understanding of how things tend to work. I think my plan is appropriate given the uncertainty right now as well as my risk tolerance (which is not too high).","['MSFT', 'TGT', 'ES']"

How do I know which to use? If it is a loss making company, do I still bother with the negative PE ratio? 

Still a beginner so hope simpler terms can be used. Thanks!",
mieh9n,gt4xmlf,stocks,comment,1617368453,">How do I know which to use?

both. and more. 

P/S and P/E are useful, but only in comparison to other companies of the same type and as part of an overall analysis process. for example, utilities and financials (banks, insurance) typically have much lower PE ratios than tech companies. but financials operate very differently from a cloud-storage company, so it's not an apples to apples comparison. 

you want to look also at price to book, price to free cashflow, and many other ways to analyze a company. you want to look at insider ownership -- if the executives at a company are selling more company stock than buying, that can be a huge red flag because it shows they don't have confidence in the company (not all insider selling is bad, they often get paid partly in stock and might need to cash out occasionally just for normal expenses). or Joel Greenblat's famous formula involves prioritizing return on capital, and earnings yield. see his book The Little Book that Beats the Market. keep reading, and you'll learn all sorts of ways to look at a company's data.

> If it is a loss making company, do I still bother with the negative PE ratio?

personally, I dislike unprofitable companies. it depends on the industry, so that's not an absolute statement. some companies like oil go through stretches where they lose money every few years. but overall, I dislike companies that are consistently unprofitable for years and years and years. I want to invest with people who are earning money, not losing money and promising to turn a profit sometime in the distant future.",

&#x200B;

* **Synopsis**
   * US equities were higher in Thursday trading, finishing near best levels. Major indices all posted gains in the holiday-shortened week as S&P 500 and Dow finished at record closes. Energy led the market on stronger crude. Tech, communication services beat the tape (FANMAG complex broadly higher). Consumer staples, healthcare, utilities the only sectors lower. Treasuries mostly firmer with some notable strength at the long end of the curve. Dollar weaker on the major crosses. Gold finished up 0.7%. WTI crude settled up 3.9% despite OPEC and its allies agreeing increase output by \~2M bpd through July.
   * **Infrastructure continued to dominate the headlines with a lot of moving pieces** after White House detailed plans to spend $2.25T+ over next eight years. Fiscal stimulus still a key piece of the bullish narrative for stocks though plans for another big spending also fit with pickup in concerns about inflation/economic overheating. Higher taxes another potential headwind for risk sentiment. Also some focus on how difficult it will be to get infrastructure stimulus passed given the lack of Republican support, competing preferences among Democrats and their razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate.
   * Busy on the data front ahead of nonfarm payrolls tomorrow. **ISM manufacturing gauge surged in March** with new orders strong, though growing backlogs and supplier delivery times reinforcing broader themes of supply chain pressures and rising input costs. Press has been picking up this theme, noting some consumer-products firms raising prices. Elsewhere, weekly **US initial jobless claims missed**, seeing a larger-than-expected uptick. On the global front, **US-China tensions** another area of focus with more concerns about Chinese incursions into Taiwan.
   * **TSM** to spend $100B on capex over next three years. **MU** beat and guided above with focus on favorable DRAM dynamics. Company and **WDC** both exploring an acquisition of Japan's Kioxia for approx. $30B. **KMX** comp sales weaker than expected, though March sales commentary upbeat. **F** announced more shutdowns due to semi shortages. **QS** up big after meeting technical milestone for additional $100M investment from Volkswagen. **CCK** in talks to sell its cans unit for more than $2B. **ANGI** acquired additional 20% interest in its MyBuilder business. **WING** comps better. **EBS** lab errors resulted in 15M ruined **JNJ** vaccine doses (but not expected to impact US supply targets). **PLAY** beat and guidance ahead on better reopening pace but stock already a big ytd gainer. **GES** EPS well ahead of consensus and guidance better with digital a bright spot.

&#x200B;

* **Digest**
   * **Most sectors higher with growth ahead of value:**
      * Growth generally led cyclical/value on first day of Q2. **Energy** the standout, following WTI higher with E&Ps particularly strong. **Tech** a big gainer with help from semis and software (MSFT also had a good day). Internets and entertainment the leaders in **communication services**. **Financials** ahead on upside across credit cards and insurance, while banks mostly brushed off Treasury yields move lower down today. **Consumer discretionary** trailed with some weakness among retailers offsetting support from AMZN and homebuilders. **Materials** saw some drag from industrial metals, with steel the weak spot. **Industrials** a bit of an underperformer with select machinery and multis down. **Healthcare** mixed with some weakness in managed care, distributors, and large-cap pharma (JNJ). **Consumer staples** worst performer with HPCs, tobacco, and grocers some of the weights.
   * **ISM Manufacturing highest in over 37 years, initial jobless claims and continuing claims miss:**
      * **March ISM Manufacturing** PMI up 3.9 points m/m to 64.7, ahead of 61.5 estimate, for highest print since Dec-1983. New Orders, production indexes highest since Jan-04, employment index highest since Feb-18. Supplier deliveries continued to slow, up to highest reading since Apr-1974. Prices also elevated, holding near highest since Jul-08. **Initial jobless claims** of 719K were up 61K w/w, and missed consensus estimates for 690K. However, prior week revised down 26K to 658K from 684K, which was lowest since the pandemic surge in claims began in Mar-20. **Continuing claims** fell to 3.794M from 3.870M, though also missed estimates for 3.775M. While this week's claims will not flow through to tomorrow's March jobs report (2-Apr, 8:30 ET), labor market data in focus given reopening and vaccine-driven economic momentum. **March nonfarm payrolls** expected to increase by 285K m/m to 614K, which would be the highest since Oct-20.
   * **OPEC+ agrees to gradual output increases of 1M bpd over the coming months:**
      * [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/opec-agrees-to-gradually-increase-oil-output-in-coming-months?srnd=premium&sref=J9GPLx1B) reported that OPEC and its allies agreed to gradually boost oil output from May to July. The group will add more than 1M bpd over the coming months, incluidng a 350K bpd increase from Saudi Arabia and Russia in May, and an additional 450K bpd in July. Saudi Arabia may also roll back some of its voluntary 1M bpd cuts. While market had expected group to roll over existing limits, article cited analysts who say product demand is expected rise by 3M bpd over the next three months, so increase isn't bearish. Comes against a lot of recent talk of caution from the group, with OPEC Secretary General Barkindo yesterday saying the oil market faces many uncertainties, particularly regarding a Covid upsurge in Europe and elsewhere ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/opec-focuses-on-fragile-demand-before-talks-on-keeping-oil-cuts?sref=J9GPLx1B)), while OPEC+ technical committee this week cut 2021 global demand forecast by 300K bpd.

mi1n4h,,stocks,post,1617301577,"What was your biggest investing mistake and what did you learn from it?I recently was well overallocated to and got hit hard in a recent downturn that was much sharper than I imagined. It was painful. Sold low, then the holding popped up hugely the next few days. So then I bought back higher, at half my original allocation, only to see it bleed down once again. On the sale, I made a 20% cap gain, and I'm happy to have an allocation I am comfortable with now. But it was an interesting experience and some valuable lessons learned: 

1. set limits on allocation

2. don't get (too) greedy

3. don't listen to redditors deriding you for your decision. and certainly don't let them influence any decision going forward. In the end, you may be right, they may be wrong. they don't know you or your portfolio. better yet, don't post your investment decisions on reddit in the heat of the moment!

4. have conviction in your decision. know the current (negative) environment and why you made your decision. base it on hard numbers. selling in a downturn isn't bad in and of itself. set conditions at which you would reconsider buying back in the future. if you don't have conviction, then do nothing.

5. remember why you entered into the position in the first place. has anything fundamentally changed?

6. it's just paper money until you sell.

7. FOMO is a b#%ch. don't let it control you. if the holding pops back up you really really need #4. plus downturns are sawtoothed, not straight down. if the negative environment hasn't changed, snap backs are common, before a further downturn takes place.",

mife5f,,stocks,post,1617348927,"Question regarding hedging with an inverse ETFA friend of my mine recently suggested an idea which I thought was very compelling and is something I’m thinking a lot about implementing in my portfolio.

Essentially, it’s that some of the most worthwhile gains in the market are found during bear markets and that by holding approx. 5% of your portfolio in an inverse ETF you will have the opportunity to exit that position for a good gain and scoop up all the bargain bin stocks with your newfound cash.

I’ve been looking at various inverse ETFs, but thought it would be worth getting some more varied perspectives on how to best implement this strategy. Has anyone here executed this before and have advice/feedback on the process?

Something that is of particular concern to me is the prospect on an inverse ETF slowly wearing down to close to zero as a bull market continues. Is this an invalid concern due to the fact that the rest of my portfolio will be performing so well, and I should be willing to view this as a cost of doing business and eat the loss?

Hoping this can spark a discussion below. Very interested in hearing your views.

mion4e,,stocks,post,1617383240,"Dividend Hunting?I have stock in ABB because of the dividend, and I have some optimistic belief they could be positioned to grow their business if we see an increase in green energy infrastructure growth. 

Anyway... In doing more research about dividends I found out that all you need to do to receive it, is to buy the stock 2 or less days before the ""record date"" to receive the dividend. I also learned that if you trade the stock within 60 days of the record date you get taxed at your income level and... The price of the stock drops by the dividend amount the day after the record date.  After holding it for 60 days, the tax rate is much lower. 

Seems like a reasonable strategy would be to find some trusted reliable stocks that offer an annual dividend, invest just before the record date, hold for 2 months for taxes. To give the stock time to rebound after the stock price drop from the dividend payout. Then you could rinse and repeat with next stock, or simply move your money into the next thing you want to take advantage of.  

Is this already a strategy? Do people in this sub do this? If so are the calendars or a cycle that people use?

Edit: thanks for the replies so far, people are asking why don't I move the money into xyz stock etc instead. Here is my reasoning from another comment.
The reason why I could see it being beneficial is that I at certain times have money sitting in my brokerage account from selling a stock.  Then the money sits a bit before I find the next ""big thing"" to park my money into. The thing might take some to present itself. I would like to park my money in a annual dividend stock for 2 months receive the dividend, and hopefully the stock is higher or equal to when I invested 2 months prior. Of course all stocks could go down. But instead of risking my investment into something that only benefits me if it goes up. I'm risking my investment into something that benefits me if it goes up or stays the same.

Essentially, I'm trying to reduce risk and gain profit. If the dividend stock is the same price or increases after 2 months I profit.  

If I invest into a non dividend stock I lose if it goes down or stays the same. (Time value of money)",

Fine, you get the dividend and the price drops by that same amount.   Now the tougher part,  your assuming the stock price goes back up.  Could happen,  could go up by even more than that,  or it could go down.   Take VZ for example, it went from ~$61 in December to near $53 in February and now heading back up. Dividend stocks don't move as much as others, but they do move by more than the dividend payment amount.

mi72im,,stocks,post,1617317271,"Amazon exploring opening outlets selling home goods, electronicshttps://fortune.com/2021/04/01/amazon-outlets-discount-home-goods-electronics/

Amazon.com Inc. has explored opening discount retail stores selling a mix of home goods and electronics, a potentially significant expansion of the company’s growing portfolio of brick-and-mortar locations.

The outlets would carry unsold inventory sitting in Amazon’s warehouses at steep discounts, according to two people familiar with the plans. The company has considered opening permanent stores, as well as pop-up locations in malls or parking lots, said the people. The plans were preliminary and under discussion last year, but the pandemic and new Fresh grocery chain forced many employees to focus on day-to-day operations.

This is a very good idea. Unsold inventory occupy the space and will cost company time and money. By opening the discount retail stores, it will be able to sell all the unsold inventory at a fast pace and save more warehouse space for useful inventory. This is also a good reopening strategy trend, which open physical stores to attract more customers to buy amazon products and invite them to become prime member. Many retail stocks are currently near 52 week high, so amazon could this the discount retail stores strategy to compete with them and increase retail market share. Investors will like any idea that amazon could increase revenue and the stock will be more attractive.",['AMZN']
mi72im,gt35hza,stocks,comment,1617319568,"I guess I'm a little skeptical, I used to work in retail and now I work in an Amazon FC and the company succeeded in the fulfillment center logistics by being efficient and they do a good job at it. Contrast that with a store and there's only so much you can do: if you have humans coming in, rooting around, moving stuff around and pawing at things you have to pay another human to put the shit back and reorganize it. It's just hard for that business model to to operate anywhere near the margins that a warehouse does. Then you factor in that the real estate in a storefront, even in a decaying mall, is so much more than the exurbs where they can plop down the FCs and make them 5 stories tall. 

The space in a fulfillment center just doesn't cost much, the inventory that's kept in a pod in the middle of a massive floor that's only accessed by robots and people fixing the robots, and the stuff is stored so much more densely than it could be in a physical retail environment. If the issue is that Amazon has capital tied up in stuff they're not turning over fast enough, why not try to squeeze the suppliers further- so the stuff gets shipped to Amazon's warehouse but Amazon doesn't own it or pay for it until its' sold? They do that with a lot of third-party vendors already. 

If Amazon's looking at it I assume they have a strategy to do it well, but it just seems like they're expanding into a lower-margin business just because.",['AMZN']

Nio delivered 7,257 cars for the month of March, the Chinese EV start-up said in a statement released Thursday. This represented a record monthly total and a 373% increase year-over-year.

The break-up of the monthly total is as follows: 1,529 ES8s, 3,152 ES6s, both of which are all-electric SUVs, and 2,576 EC6 premium smart electric coupe SUVs.

The quarterly number was at a record 20,060 vehicles, up 423% from the first quarter of 2020.

Nio has outperformed its domestic rival XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV), which reported earlier Thursday monthly deliveries that could not beat its January total.

I've heard someone from ARKG basically state it's a combination of these two things and that luck will play a factor, which is why they've got so many small positions in so many companies rather than a few large conviction holdings like they have in other portfolios. Holdings like Teladoc and Exact Sciences could even be seen as stable anchors to protect the fund against the volatility of the smaller genomics holdings.

company overview :  founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its  reserves with the   acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid  future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent 

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020, 

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure  .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed,  they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't  functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

&#x200B;

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater  third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations 

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by  those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and  optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",

mi97y4,,stocks,post,1617324324,"ESOP and it’s effects on stock priceI’ve been following a company that I’m very interested in. It’s a small cap company with cool products and a visionary CEO. My concern currently is the amount of shares they have (2.5 billion outstanding). The CEO has said he will not pursue a reverse split or a buyback. He did mention the possibility of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) however. 

My question is how does an ESOP affect the amount of outstanding shares or float? Could they effectively cut the current share pool in half by declaring half of them for employees only? I have no idea how it works and googling has not been super helpful.",
mi97y4,gt3gh9a,stocks,comment,1617325757,"Usually the esop just means the employees get some benefit to purchase the stock.   Often it’s either subsidized by the company or offered at a fixed price to the employee based on some schedule, and comes with some type of limitations around selling the stock.   Often esop stock is not supposed to be sold for the duration of employment, so it’s a way for the company to reduce the effective float at a discount without doing a buyback or reverse split or something.   These esop programs can vary widely but most often they have some requirement for officers of the company to hold some amount of stock, with x years to accomplish it.   So if they set the requirement at 1x salary for all directors and up, a large company with many director level roles could possibly set back from a few million dollars in a year up to tens of millions.   Other esop structures can offer stock as part of salary or as a performance bonus, or offer ITM options that have a requirement to be exercised, it can really be set up any number of ways to varying degrees.

Tldr; it won’t reduce the total number of shares in circulation, or technically reduce the float, but it will have a dampening effect to the circulating shares by constraining some of them in long term holds by employees.  To calculate the impact you’d need to read the terms of the esop and do a bit of math.",

mi2vhe,,stocks,post,1617305019,"ATT vs Verizon vs T mobileI have owned ATT for some time and although I am very happy with the dividend, I realize that the company seems to be in a tough spot. Compared to Verizon, it seems that ATT is almost stagnant as a company and is having a hard time investing in future growth. It also did not raise it's dividend recently and I feel as if they face risk of having to cut the dividend In the future if they don't start becoming more profitable. 

Verizon seems to be in a better overall position especially when it comes to 5G exposure and quality. They pay less of a dividend though, which I am okay with because that frees capital for investments in their business. and while I do like the slight exposure to HBO max through ATT, I feel as if it is a small niche and the overall company isn't going to benefit greatly even if it grows well. I also own disney, so I do have other streaming services in my portfolio.

T mobile seems to be the aggressive approach as the share price seems to reflect them doing well already, which worries me. I know they are in the 5G game, but my big gripe with them is the lack of a dividend. I don't think the share valuation with no dividend justifies the valuation, so I almost just included it to see if there's something I'm not really seeing. It probably has better growth prospects than Verizon or ATT, but if I'm cutting ATTs sweet dividends, I think Verizon will be my pick. 

I'm wondering if anybody here holds shares in any of these companies and can shine some light on why they chose them. I'm obviously leaning towards cutting my entire ATT position and entering into Verizon. T mobile seems to be a bit aggressive and expensive, especially since I'd be losing dividend payments if I were to transition to that stock. Any insight is appreciated.",

mhxib0,,stocks,post,1617290248,"Found Old Stock Certificates, Are They Worthless?My father recently gave me a couple physical stock certificates that my grandfather bought in the 70s-80s. I've tried looking up the two companies listed on the certificates in Google, the NYS Division of Corporations website, and on my brokerage app but I can't seem to locate these companies, or any company that used to be known as these two.

The companies are:

* APPLIED MANAGEMENT SCIENCES INC. (certificate issued 08/01/1989)

**EDIT:** Thanks to /u/Beholder88 
> Applied Management Sciences Inc: ""Applied Management Services was acquired by Aspen Systems in 1989. The Company offered survey and data analysis as well as business process re-engineering."" Aspen systems still seems to exist, per Google, but it looks like they're a private company as I can't find anything on stock for them. You're probably out of luck there.

* DEEP SEA TECHNIQUES, INC. (cert. issued 04/12/1973)

**EDIT2:** 

Just got off the phone with Fidelity, they were very kind but ultimately had no luck in researching Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. for me. I was told to attempt to locate the ""issuer"" listed on the stock certificate, but all I see is the transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer Company (trying to find out if they are now known as Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company). 

I actually located an old prospectus for Deep Sea which listed an old name they had, as well as an address. There's nothing located at the address, but I managed to locate an SEC News Digest article about Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. offering shares of common stock for public sale by E.L. Aaron & Co. 

Looking up this broker-dealer, I found a case: SEC v. Aaron regarding an appeal to a prior decision regarding a permanent injunction for violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. I don't think I will get much farther with this route, going to attempt contacting the transfer agent.

~

If anyone could help me discover if these companies are out of business, and conclude that my shares are worthless, it would be much appreciated. From what I can tell, Deep Sea Techniques was incorporated in the state of New York but Applied Management Sciences was incorporated in the state of Oregon.

**EDIT3:** Thanks /u/FinalDevice for having eyes.
>Note the names do not match here: ""Applied Management Sciences"" vs ""Applied Management Services"". It could be the same company and a type or a d.b.a. name, or it could be unrelated.


Confirmed through Fidelity and the transfer agent that Deep Sea Techniques, Inc. is dissolved. I'll hang on to the stock certificate and ask my father if he wants to keep it or see if a collector would buy it online.

As for Applied Management Sciences, Inc., the transfer agent listed on the stock certificate filed a notice of withdrawal as a transfer agent with the SEC, as well as their successor lol but I found the last link in the chain and will attempt to contact them tomorrow with the CUSIP.

mj4w7u,gt8q5y9,investing,comment,1617455468,"#  Back-up Generators and Climate Change? 

After the Texas freeze, I've been thinking a lot about how to invest in climate resilience. I'm not talking about energy solutions, I'm talking about steps that governments, companies, and people will take to protect themselves from the inevitable climate disasters. I think investors are over emphasizing things like EV's (which are crucial) and more speculative hydrogen companies in lieu of more practical investments like insurance and **back-up generators**. I'm very bullish on propane and diesel generators in the coming years. Here's some use-cases:

1. A lot of critical infrastructure (hospitals, sewer plants, etc.) already are required to have massive back-up generators, but there will be lots of pressure to upgrade and refurbish. Plus, other businesses that previously didn't see the need could make the investment.
2. General population could purchase smaller portable generators for their homes, incase they lost power for several days.
3. Governments will need to stockpile more. Think back to hurricane Maria, when Puerto Rico was on back-up generators for like half a year.

A lot of other people have already considered this. Go look at Generac Holdings (GNRC's) chart from this year. Notice the huge spike after the Texas freeze. There were a bunch of articles and hype, so party was over by that point. Right now, they've got a decent side-way's consolidation, but their PE (58.98) is too high for my liking. Who knows though, they could really grow that much? Fun fact, they also got a huge bump after Maria in 2017.

After some cursory searching, I could not find other stocks that I really like. There's some tentative companies, but they've got draw backs. For example, Caterpillar and Cummins, are obviously involved with tons of other stuff. So the back-up generator sales gets muted, and I might as well just buy the DOW. I've also looked at Regal Beloit (RBC), their PE looks more conservative. RBC also makes tons of other electrical components, which is good considering the new infrastructure bill. I'm hoping to buy some on dip within the next 6 months.

I'm a rookie investor (24 y/o who just manages his retirement account), so sorry if this lacks aspects of strong DD. I don't have a good background with the minutiae of balance sheets Hopefully smarter folks on this sub are kind and willing to help. Here's what I'm most interested in:

1. Would you consider RBC or GNRC good investments?
2. Are there any good companies that I've missed? I'm especially those abroad, I don't know much about investing internationally, but I'm eager to learn more.

mj4vlw,gt8jon7,investing,comment,1617450731,"Hi Everyone, I have been lurking for a while, and I have a question, and I think smarter people than me could help me answer as it is rather complex. I went to Financial advisors in the US who were not of great help to me on the subject.

First here is the background. I am 38, employed, living in LI, NY,  my household income is around 180k$/y and I have no children. I (Canadian Citizen) and my wife (US Citizen), have been living in Switzerland for the last ten years and moved to the USA early in 2020 when I accepted a position here. In terms of pension here in the USA, I am all set with 401a, 401k, and eventually Roth IRA. We have two car loans totaling 25k. 

When it comes to Switzerland, it becomes more complicated. During our time there I contributed to what the Swiss call the pillar system, mainly the first pillar (like SS) and second pillar (like 401k/401a). As I left the country, this money needs to be reattributed to me in some manner. If I had moved to an EU country, the money would have been transferred to an equivalent entity in this country. However, no such agreement exists with the US.  I, therefore, need to pull out the money in cash, as a lump sum. The amount is \~100kCHF. With the pandemic, it has not been easy to get this going, but I hope to have it done soon. This money now sits in a Swiss bank with no little interest paid. Once it is transferred to me, the money will be taxed (a small tax, \~1000CHF) and deposited in my Swiss account. My understanding is that there is then no double taxation agreement with the USA, so this post-tax money could be transferred in USD to my USA account.  This is my retirement money, so my perspective for it is long-term, and my risk tolerance is moderate. This is not gambling money. All Swiss accounts are declared to IRS.

Meanwhile, here in the USA, I have around 50k Saved for a house, also in cash. The idea is to purchase in the next few years.

My question is the following. What should I do with this money? Should I leave it as CHF in Switzerland, or move it here ASAP? CHF is a refuge currency, and usually keeps high value, so I guess my money is shielded if some large crash happens, but my feeling is I have way too much money sitting in cash right now.

I was thinking to use this money to max out my contributions to 401k and Roth IRA, but this would spread over a few years.  As I mentioned, most financial advisors here are not useful, and will only talk about the money once it is in USD in their account... I do not know of advisors who deal with this kind of situation.

Would it be better to keep it in CHF and invest in the Swiss stock market and funds, ETF, etc..? I would be very interested in hearing the opinion of people here. Thank you in advance!",

You can see WY doesn’t have a crazy evaluation. It also peaked in 2007 during the last housing boom.

One everyone got stuck at home and realized their yard could use a new patio or wall or shrubs or what ever and thus started to hit our market hard.

mijlje,,investing,post,1617367458,"U.S. job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%https://reut.rs/3dxM6RH

U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.

Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”

Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   

First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.",

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, global chip parts and shipping shortages, rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k). This would mean Tesla could expand their BEV market share from 23% in 2020 to 23-30% in 2021 (based on projections for BEV market to grow 50-70% this year). All this despite increasing “competition”.

mj90ot,,investing,post,1617458320,"High Yield when they are Low YieldUsing data sources from FRED, the US High Yield Effective yield (EY) is below 5%. This is new territory.

Looking at the EY average for the end of each week, Pre-pandemic, there are 155 weeks in total where the EY traded below 6%. I decided to see what the subsequent 12-month total return (TR) was when yields were this low. Here are those findings:

- Average TR 3.1%
- Median TR 2.8%
- Largest positive TR 8.1% (03/06/2020-03/06/2021)
- Largest negative TR -3.6% (08/29/2014-08/29/2015)
- Number of positive returns 132 weeks
- Number of negative or zero returns 23 weeks

A few bits I find interesting, yet not surprising, is that the best TR period with historically low yields came during a period of high volatility (COVID) while the worst TR period came from a period of a relatively long period grinding-ly low yields.

Surprisingly, the number of weeks with a positive TR vs negative or zero TR is a ratio of 5.74:1, not something I would have expected. Then again, in the grand scheme of things, sub-6% EY is itself new territory. 

In the end, the average and median returns are quite meager and it’s likely that the subsequent 12-month return in this space, from 2021 Q1, will fall below these numbers barring some short lived period of high volatility with a recovery, e.g. COVID-19 like period.",

>In a 2019 filing, the attorney general's office said that Bitfinex handed $850 million to a Panama entity called Crypto Capital without disclosing it to investors. Executives at Bitfinex and Tether then allegedly engaged in a series of transactions that opened up Tether's cash reserves to Bitfinex.

**What is tether?**

[Tether](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) is a 1 to 1 dollar peg cryptocurrency. It accounts for [60-80% ](https://coinlib.io/coin/BTC/Bitcoin)of all trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges.

**What is the significance of tether?**

Please read the price manipulation section on it’s [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)) page. In a nut shell, tether has been strategically printed (backed by nothing) and used to manipulate the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market. There is a high [correlation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2021-01-14/research-affiliates-quant-warns-of-bitcoin-market-manipulation) between how much tether is printed and Bitcoin’s price.

**What happens now?**

This has long been one the cryptocurrency’s market biggest fears. That the price increases were mostly due to artificial demand. As to what happens next, I’m not sure, and no one really knows. I can speculate that Powell and Yellen may use this firepower to enact stricter legislation on the cryptocurrency market. Maybe Tether needs to be banned altogether. But if tether is banned what will happen to the artificially inflated Bitcoin/cryptocurrency market?

[Tether recently released a statement in an attempt to show that all its stablecoins are fully backed. However, it fails to disclose what it's holdings are. “For all we know, they could have $25 in their bank account and the rest could be in Bitcoin.”](https://decrypt.co/63577/tether-attestation-takeaways)

Across all U.S.-domiciled funds, the ETF stood out in February for having the most concentration in companies in which it owned 10% or more of floating shares--that doesn’t even include additional vehicles tied to the strategy, which combined amount to another $15 billion.

\- Without risk-management professionals to stress-test the portfolio’s risk exposures, estimate its potential losses during historical or hypothetical market environments, and gauge worst-case scenarios, the team is poorly positioned to prepare and react.

\-To mitigate market-impact costs, ARK must build new positions more slowly and exit gradually. But its bullish or bearish signals are available for all to see--as an ETF, the strategy must disclose its portfolios to the market each day--and traders can respond either by buying up a stock’s known supply (putting upward pressure on its price) or selling it (downward pressure) before ARK has offloaded its own position.",['ARKK']

mj2qmk,,investing,post,1617430149,"Drd gold , a vertical growth gold mine(first dd, constructional critism will be welcomed)
disclaimer : i am not a financial advisor I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

company overview : founded at south africa in 1895. drdgold invented itself in the late 1900's and now is a world leader (although operates only in south africa) in retreatment of gold from tailing dams, in 2018 almost doubled its reserves with the acquisition of wrtrp from world platinum and gold mining giant sibanye stillwaters for majority stake in the company, traded primary at jse and secondary as nyse adr.

i believe this company and inevitably the stock is about to enter, or more accurately maintain and accelerate a fast growth phase which will potentially multiply the company value numerous times .

my belief comes from the company past present and its clear and very solid future that is almost secured, on this post i will explain each one of the three and why those are contributing its growth potential and the implementation of the spoken potential.

first of all, let's talk about the past of the company in the last critical 5 years:

performance :

the company eps took off 520% percent from 2016

the roe jumped from 4 to 16 percent

the company profit margin skyrocketed from 2.55% in 2016 to 15% in 2020,

fact that is important(from reasons i will explain later) is that the profit margin in 2019 was 2.8%

the explain later part, or cash flow :

drdgold numbers weren't really great from a really fantastically good reason :capital expenditure .

the percent of fcf only from financing and operating activities that lost in investment activities in 2016 was around 75 percent, in 2017, a weak year that they use to plant the seeds of future growth , the rate was 1600% percent, they lost cashflow that year , 2018 75% , 2019 105% and in 2020, after years of enormous growth rate in cash flow invested they invested 38% less and the fcf from financing and operating activities that reinvested was 12%, while their earnings got bigger and the profit margin and roe skyrocketed, they invested for future growth for years and now instead of a first bud to peek from the surface of the well watered ground, a mighty oak tree welcomed the gardners in the morning, but as big a oak tree is, i believe this stock is a giant sequoia.

why is the growth at 2020 was so big:

the reserves acquisitions from Sibanye stillwater wasn't functional until 2019-2020, and i believe that it still have a room to become fully functional, as the company stated, they are in stage 2 of the wrtrp , the first was to start operating and the second is a high volume processing plant near the dumps.

 

present and sustained future or the affects of the deal outside gain in reserves :

gold is Sibanye stillwater third biggest export, the first is pgm, and as the ceo stated, drdgold will start in partnership with Sibanye stillwater to process pgm tailings, which will not only cause a huge vertical growth and huge growth in profit, it will make the company less dependant in the cycle of the gold price, and will make more investors to buy it.

additionally their use of big data helps stabilize and slightly improve(when multiplied in 20 million tons a month is quite a bit) their operations

some more future :

in the annual report the company wrote about their strategic outlook which is a huge vertical growth phase by those means:

2021-2026

DRDGOLD – through acquisitions, be able to offer integrated, sustainable tailings management solutions with international reach and by doing this, expand our role in environmental clean-up in the interest of sustainable land use, reduced pollution and societal upliftment

Platinum group metals – consider opportunities through our anchor shareholder, locally and internationally

2027 and beyond

DRDGOLD – consolidate all surface tailings in South Africa and look to international opportunities for surface mining

those, combined with horizontal growth by improving the efficiency of the current facilities, building west rand storage facility, and optimasion the use of already majority of the water grey water,

will make them a big ass square, so my conclusion is that drdgold will experience massive growth at the next 5 and the next 10 years.

i hope you found my post useful.",

In other words, there are *opportunities* in transition to a green economy, and one that has been enshrined in pledges both by public and private institutions. New energy generation, energy efficiency technology, sustainable practices, increase in carbon price and changing customer demands.

A very obvious one: carbon price. It is expected that carbon price needs to be at around 100 USD/eCO2MT in order to achieve the 2 deg transition. What is the current carbon price now? In Europe (the highest) it is only \~37 EUR! And yet the targeted emission reduction in the next few decades already mandates that there be 7% increase in carbon price per annum!

My own portfolio reflects this. There will be a cost to investments which do not price in future carbon price, future policies, future ""green"" and sustainable product/service demand, etc. That's why I am invested in:

- ERTH: MSCI Sustainable Future ETF, companies which contribute to transition to a more sustainable future. They will benefit from new regulatory changes, financing and investments in the future.

- ETHO: Top 50% companies in the US which are more efficient in climate change transition (includes even Scope 3 carbon emission consideration!). They will not get penalized when US starts to increase/impose carbon tax.

- HSXD: Top companies in Asia Pacific ex-Japan with 50% less carbon emission. Same reason as above, but in mostly emerging markets in Asia

Quite interesting comment in the end:

from ""EcoQuant"":

// Well, one can offer the mindless ""contrarian trade"" argument, but to what end?

In substance, what should be proper prices and earnings expectations are difficult to estimate.

First, there is no documented precedent for such a mammoth energy transition.  Historical comparisons are *so different* even if available.  What do we know about markets and shares during the transition from camphor to whale oil?  Or the displacement of the latter by petroleum and gas? 

Second, this is an odd-duck technology transformation, not a classical energy transformation based upon mining and extraction and analog elements, although it isn't completely devoid of that.  The analogy always is various digital electronics, whether semiconductors and computing and digital photography.  In those markets, the best and most expensive are offered first, and then, as demand grows, proceeds fund development of versions which are as capable, but much cheaper, and the most expensive are offered, in subsequent years, models which cost the same but now have more capability. The price of a unit of goodness goes down. You can always get the cheaper by waiting, but then there are no advantages *now*. Zero Carbon energy isn't entirely like that. The idea of changing out wind turbines for more efficient ones does not quite work.  It mind work for solar PV, however, assuming the inverters can keep up.  All these elements influence costs and pricing.

Third, if PV and wind are cheaper to generate with technology a year from now than today, new players to markets using these cheaper technologies can undercut zero Carbon offerings which are older.  To some degree, the technology means these energy sources are competing against themselves.  That may seem bad, but realize whether considering computers or digital cameras or smart phones, these successes were not hindered by such rollouts.  Now, that may be because those are a consumer marketplace and wind and solar are wholesale business marketplaces, but in the long run, shouldn't the behavior be the same?

Fourth, scaling up wind and solar and storage to the level needed for a global transformation itself imposes resource and financial costs. It is notable that Copper funds have also traded up, because cheaper sources of Copper are being exhausted, and Copper is needed everywhere, in PV, wind, and in EVs and storage. Prices for companies which assumed one cost of Copper are discovering that, in time, these will be higher.  That's not destructive, but it has an influence. 

Fifth, there's the wild card of software and innovation and improvements in the basic technology, especially concerning energy storage. A sudden innovation could make the grid work better, or storage be cheaper even if the chemistry hasn't changed, or make overlay energy networks the *de facto* model. This affects prices and expectations, too.

In net, these short term concerns are just that, and anyone who is betting long term on fossil fuels may profit in the short run, but will lose out in the long, no matter the fate of the current U.S. administration, its policies, or whoever wins the next Congress or Presidency. A contrarian political leadership can throw artificial impediments into the path of continued rollout, but that will not be popular with corporations, who have now committed billions to making this a reality. 

Those continuing to back fossil fuels are equivalent to those who invested in horses and buggies in 1904.  //",['DE']

I understood that it was a lot, but I figured I’d get a good job and get there one step at a time. 

I recently finished paying off my student debt (50k) four years after college (6 years out now). I lived way below my means to make this happen. Recently, I have gotten into investing and I am very focused on compound interest. I started maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, and also started a brokerage account for additional stocks.

**Key takeaways**

* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices
* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation
* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S & G

## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices

Just like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.

## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up

Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.

## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G

Few ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand & CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.

## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing

A number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (""DeFi"") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",['ICE']

There needs to be people that will trade Bitcoin for other goods and services rather than just holding as an investment. Trading in fractions isn’t very appealing to people. The thing with the USD is the inflation is pretty predictable, and prices relatively stay the same throughout the years. But with Bitcoin, you can buy something and in 5 months either be able to buy 10 more of them with the same amount, or none at all. Due to these crazy fluctuations heavily connected to the US dollar, people will have to make a decision on whether or not they actually want to spend their Bitcoin on something knowing full well the value of their Bitcoin can double, but the item they purchase will remain the exact same cost in the USD equivalent. It’s risky business with every transaction.",

mi3bt3,,investing,post,1617306304,"Micron Soars On Chip Shortage ""Perfect Storm""In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.

Shares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan’s Kioxia.

Below, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron’s stellar results:

RBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)

    Micron’s results are “solid across the board” and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus
    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC’s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate
    Micron continues to see “robust” demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving

Cowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)

    Says it is “hard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,” noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint
    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins

Evercore (outperform, PT $135)

    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a “perfect storm”
    Says the DRAM market is in “severe” shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron’s management expects further tightening through 2021
    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it’s “hard to see issues head,” especially considering lean inventories at Micron’s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22

Piper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)

    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends
    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving
    Believes strength is likely to persist through much of calendar 2021 before potentially subsiding to more normal trends in calendar 2022","['NVDA', 'WDC', 'AMAT', 'INTC']"

Lower expense ratios are nice, but it takes 5+ years for the expense ratio savings in EBIT to compensate you for GBTC's discount. And that assumes the increasing competition doesn't force Grayscale to lower their fee in the coming months/years.

mi2467,,investing,post,1617302905,"Opinion: SUNW is a pump & dump. Tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**

I understand that solar isn't something most people are enthusiastic about. However, as a decades long solar industry veteran, I see something happening, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, SUNW:**

* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their debt is increasing.
* SUNW currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California. This is an incredibly low number of installs for a solar company that primarily operates in a State where solar is mandatory for all new homes.
* SUNW does not manufacture solar panels or equipment. SUNW does not develop any proprietary hardware or software to my knowledge. They are simply a solar reseller that operates off of debt, similar to RUN and NOVA, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* SUNW is facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* SUNW is also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* SUNW's biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as RUN, NOVA, TSLA, and SPWR. Currently SUNW offers nothing unique to give them an advantage over their competition.
* SUNW's stock price seems to be benefiting solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing similarly classed solar companies, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, their biggest competitor RUN was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.SUNW was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that SUNW's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from SUNW: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. If you're unfamiliar with the solar industry, the solar ETFs are a solid alternative.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I have more solar customers than Sunworks.

Disclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought Friday (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.

TLDR: It looks bad.

> SUNW accumulated debt of -$88m   

Debt and accumulated equity deficit are not the same thing. Debt of a company is the total liabilities. Which in the case of SUNW is only $18M, mostly short term operational debt. Their long term liability is only a few million.  

The -$88m is their total accumulated equity deficit since inception. Not money they owe.  

> SUNW completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020. 

This appears to be because they generate most of their revenue from commercial solar projects, not residential installs.  Smaller number of large scale project, which is how they generate almost $40M in revenue from 500 installs.

In general, with a focus on commercial I’m not surprised they took a revenue hit. But they ended 2020 with $39M in the bank. Added another $49M through a stock issue. They don’t have a cash problem.  

And last year they lost $15M, $4 of which was Goodwill and $3M in one time legal fees and bad debt. Nothing unusual here.

It is still over valued IMO but there is nothing wrong with their balance sheet and they have plenty of working capital. They have a lot of cash and they appear to be using it to acquire smaller solar companies.",['MMM']

I have been seeing, for the past few months, a lot of news regarding the Turkish lira and how it lost so much value and how Turkey's economy is in shambles, etc. Not only that but Erdogan doesn't make things easier and might very well take the country to total economic collapse.

My question is if it would be reasonable to invest in Turkey. Not necessarily in stocks, since as I said Turkey might face a huge crisis in the near future. I was thinking more in terms of real estate. For example, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it has and will always have a certain appeal to a lot of people that makes it valuable whatever happens (well, excluding the city itself being destroyed, but kind of unrealistic). So, for a person living in the eurozone like myself, would an investment in real estate in, say, Istanbul, be a good decision? As far as I see it, because the lira devalued so much, it would be much cheaper for someone holding other currencies.

Goldman is looking at ultimately offering a “full spectrum” of investments in bitcoin and digital assets, “whether that’s through the **physical bitcoin, derivatives or traditional investment vehicles**,” she said.

The move means that soon, clients of two of the world’s preeminent investment banks – Goldman and Morgan Stanley – will have access to a nascent asset class that has intrigued billionaires and digital currency believers alike. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley told its financial advisors that **they could place clients into bitcoin funds starting in April**, CNBC was first to report.

It is the latest sign of the staying power of blockchain-related assets including bitcoin, a new kind of money that emerged out of the wreckage of the 2008 financial crisis and whose exact origins are still unknown. Until now, big U.S. banks have mostly shunned bitcoin, deeming it too speculative and volatile for clients.

But the industry capitulated after the latest boom in bitcoin’s price. The surge has drawn in institutional investors, corporations and fintech players, and the infrastructure to hold digital assets is continuing to mature. In the end, it was client demand that won out, according to Rich.

“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” Rich said. “There are also a large contingent of clients who feel like we’re sitting at the dawn of a new Internet in some ways and are looking for ways to participate in this space.”

Goldman’s private wealth management business mostly targets individuals, families and endowments **with at least $25 million to invest**.

The bank may offer bitcoin investment funds, similar to those that Morgan Stanley will have, as well as other ways to invest that are “more akin to the underlying asset class which trades 24-7 globally,” Rich said. Some cryptofunds, such as the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, can only be sold or bought once per quarter, she said.

“We’re still in the very nascent stages of this ecosystem; no one knows exactly how it will evolve or what shape it will be,” Rich said. “But I think it’s fairly safe to expect it will be part of our future.”

Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

Horizon 10-15 years

20K to begin with, topping at least 1K per month.
 
I read a couple of books on investing over the weekend and came to the conclusion that with my (lack of) knowledge of the markets my best bet is to go for maximally diversified portfolio,  and put it all into shares for now, to (hopefully!) gain some momentum to begin with. I’d be also inclined to tilt it a little towards growth and tech for the coming year.
 
So I’m thinking:
 
75%  Vanguard FTSE All-world (VWRP =  VT in the US) TER 0.25%

15%  Nasdaq 100 (=QQQ) TER 0.30%

10%  S&P SmallCap 600 TER 0.375%
 
I’m not sure what to think of the overlap between Nasdaq and All-World. It adds exposure to that sector of course, but it tech has done so well over the past 5 years…
 
One alternative would be to keep it super simple and just go for All-World. There’s also a cheaper All-World option on my platform, although it hasn’t done as well as the Vanguard one.

I have AAPL (7 shares), AMZN (.13 shares), TSLA (.6 shares), DIS (2 shares), CCIV (31 shares), CMG (.13 shares), COST (.64 shares), VYNE (12 shares), RWT (20 shares), VHT (.5 shares), VNQ (5 shares), VOO (.2 shares)., ARKK (1.4 shares), THNQ (2.15 shares), BOTZ (.6 shares), ARKQ (.29 shares) and ARKX (2 shares).

My goal was to continue buying fractional shares each pay check in Amazon, Tesla, Costco and Chipotle so I can slowly accumulate more equity over time, but I'm beginning to wonder if it makes more sense to just sell my fractional shares and re-allocate those investments into VOO and ARKK. I do like holding single stocks of Apple and Disney and since they aren't quite as high in cost I've been able to buy whole shares which is nice. I guess I'm not sure if trying to obtain a single share of Amazon over time is even worth it, or if I'd see a greater return putting $3k into VOO. I do plan to eventually get rid of VYNE, I bought that on a whim and am in the red but I've been waiting for it to bounce up.

So I guess I'm just looking for general feedback on whether it would make sense to continue beefing up my standings in some of these stocks over time or if I'd be better suited to just put those dollars into indexes and ETFs for the most part?","['ARKK', 'DIS', 'TSLA', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'CMG']"

mhe419,,investing,post,1617220117,"Quantifying Beta Slippage (Why Leveraged ETFs are Not as Scary as You Might Think)(results linked below)

If you are somewhat familiar with leveraged ETFs you have no doubt heard the many warnings that surround them. Warnings involving phrases like ""decaying value"" or ""daily rebalancing"". However, you, like I, may have also noticed that all of these warnings use hypothetical examples to show why leveraged ETFs are risky. These examples will be scenarios such as ""daily SP500 returns oscillate between +10% and -10% for 50 days""; scenarios which are incredibly unlikely to occur in the actual market. Additionally, any novice trader can check the graphs of TQQQ and QQQ and see that (as of today) they would have outperformed QQQ if they had bought and held TQQQ at *any* point before September 2020. So what to do with leveraged ETFs?

All of the fears relating to leveraged ETFs are neatly captured in the term ""Beta Slippage"": Beta (volatility) + Slippage (difference from expectation). It is true that the trend and volatility of a market/sector directly impacts the performance of leveraged ETFs based on them. But are all leveraged ETFs inevitably victims of Beta Slippage as some articles would imply?

To answer these questions I set out to quantify Beta Slippage for the top 25 (by NAV) leveraged ETFs, and see if the fears were justified or overblown.

If you aren't curious about how this was done, the results spreadsheet is linked at the bottom.

If you are:

I used TD Ameritrade's API to get price data for leveraged ETFs and their underlying securities. I then looked at all of the possible 1-day, 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year holding timeframes a trader could have held the ETF for. I then found, for each timeframe, the return of the underlying security. I then calculated the return of an ideal leveraged ETF using the return of the underlying security and the ETF's leverage factor. This ideal leveraged ETF perfectly scales performance over any timeframe. Finally, I found the % difference between the price of the actual leveraged ETF and the price of the ideal ETF. I called this % difference Beta Slippage, as I could not find a formula for it elsewhere.

So, in short, the results in the data show the average % difference between an actual leveraged ETF and its perfectly leveraged version (no beta slippage) if you hold it over various timeframes.

Please take a look at the data, let me know how you think it could be improved!

I could not find exact indices for some of the underlying funds so I had to settle for ETF versions of them, also some symbols had very limited data so take that into account.

I found out that MKTY was pretty interesting.  
They don't operate as RIOT and MARA.

**MKTY Edge:**

* Operates at lower cost than MARA, and 4x cheaper than RIOT
* Managed by a PE firm
* Is more likely to be resilient to volality, since they sell their the currency mined
* Currently operating a 2.2 MW Facility in Washington State, and plans to expand to 50MW by end of the year. All their equipment has been bought from another miner bankruptcy from a few years ago (→ not subject to shortage equipment as opposed to any other competitor)

**Cost to mine**

* **MKTY energy cost: 0.024$ / KwH**
* Mara energy cost: 0.028$ / KwH
* Riot energy cost: 0.08$ / KwH (historial energy cost)

**Currently trading at an heavy discount compared to MARA and RIOT**

* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of RIOT : 423x
* Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MARA: 995x
* **Last twelve months Price to Sales ratio of MKTY: 12x**

**Why is MKTY under-the-radar?**

* Recently uplisted on the Nasdaq
* Small Market Cap ($120mm)
* Management team focussing on execution rather than PR
* Low float & high insider ownership (40%)
* Low volume (about 90k shares / day)

MKTY sounds like a company to keep an eye on given all these reasons.

**What is Zedge?**

Zedge is a phone customization app that runs a marketplace for users to download wallpapers and ringtones. As of the latest earnings report, Zedge had **482M installs** on both the play store and app store, and **35.4M monthly active users**.

The app generates revenue from a combination of advertising, paid subscriptions, and their Zedge Premium marketplace, which allows creators to sell their own digital content.

It has a current market cap of **$168M dollars**

Ticker symbol : **ZDGE**

&#x200B;

**The growth story**

While zedge’s user growth has been unimpressive over the pandemic (13.7% for installs and 3.3% for monthly active users), its revenue growth is likely behind its recent increase in stock price.

&#x200B;

**Q2 2020: $2.6M Revenue, $0.1M Earnings, $0.026 ARPMAU, $0.6M cash flow**

**Q2 2021: $5.3M Revenue, $2.5M earnings $0.049 ARPMAU, $2.3M cash flow**

&#x200B;

**101%** revenue growth, **3087%** earnings growth, **87.7%** ARPMAU growth, **269%** cash flow growth

&#x200B;

Zedge has had revenue growth quarter on quarter for the past three quarters, with advertising revenue being the main driver.

This growth was due to “optimization of ad waterfall and an increase in advertising rates relating to year-end ad budge”, as per their most recent earnings call.

While I could talk about more numbers, I think it would be easier to look at the 3rd table from their latest [earnings report](https://investor.zedge.net/prviewer/release_only/id/4658616).

Link: [https://imgur.com/lrByTCo](https://imgur.com/lrByTCo)

This 100% revenue increase has occurred while operating expenses have stayed almost the same, increasing marginally from **$2.25M to $2.4M**, leading to greater profit margins.

Management is forecasting revenue to increase between **75% to 80%** for FY21, which would be an increase in revenues from **$9.4m to $16.45M**. (Management were previously

&#x200B;

**Heavy Insider buying**

The stock has seen significant insider buying by the CEO and directors as early as when the stock price was $1 in March of 2020. The good news is that this insider buying has continued on the way up, with insider buying by the CEO and a director at $7 on 01/19/20 and 01/20/20. This (almost) cluster buy shows a high level of conviction by insiders in their company.

However, the CFO did sell at $15 on 03/24/21, but when the stock price has risen this much (almost 1400%) it is natural to take some profits, so this does not worry me. The CEO and director are still yet to reduce their holdings.

&#x200B;

**Solid balance sheet**

According to yahoo finance, Zedge has a **current ratio of 4.65.**

It is cash rich with over **$13.5M** on the balance sheet, and almost debt free with only **492k.**

\*\*In their latest earnings call, they have said that they would like to acquire a company related to ""\*\*mobile gaming, social video, and even mindfulness""

[Source (Yahoo Finance):](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZDGE/key-statistics?p=ZDGE)

&#x200B;

**A reasonable valuation**

As of writing, Zedge trades for **$12.55**, a **25% decrease from its high of $16.93**, which it reached after its stellar earnings report. This tumble in stock price has not been due to any news or change in fundamentals and likely due to the recent downturn in tech and growth stocks.

Zedge, at its current price has a **P/S ratio of 13** based on TTM revenue. If revenue meets management’s guidance for FY21, it trades at a P/S ratio of 10.5.

The **PE ratio is currently 45**, and the forward p/e is 29 based on analyst recommendations. Prior to the most recent earnings release, the stock was trading at a 130 PE ratio

Although this is not cheap, this in my opinion is a reasonable valuation for an almost adtech-like company that is experiencing rapid growth. I believe that this stock would have been trading upwards of $20 dollars if it weren’t for the recent downturn in growth tech stocks.

If we value the stock at a forward PE ratio of 50, my price target for this stock is **$21.60**, ( which is a conservative estimate considering that this is a growth tech stock. The price target by analysts is **$24** (although price targets often mean very little.) This could certainly go much further should market conditions for growth stocks change.

The company could also expand into the NFT market, as it provides a marketplace for unique content like wallpapers. However, this is pure speculation and should not be the reason for investment.

When considering risks, there is the possibility that growth in advertising revenue starts to slow down, however management see no sign of this currently due to their current forecasts. It may be important to note management were forecasting 20% revenue growth for FY21 in prior earnings calls.

&#x200B;

The idea of a company that sells novelty crap for your phone sounds like a nothing burger. And I see a Reddit thread about this company from 7 months ago DDing it as a penny stock. They were all hyped about it as a growth stock, and they were right. I worry that 1400% growth since then means that a lot of future growth is priced in already. In fact, as you said, the price has already fallen down from that hype peak, which suggests to me that maybe it corrected to a fair price. Either way, I don't feel great about getting a good deal right now.

It concerns me that their earnings came from advertising rather than from their more fundamental activities. Ad revenue only works as long as they continue to have users viewing them. And so it's an even bigger concern that their user growth slowed during a time when people were using devices more than ever.

It's a company that claims to be an e-commerce marketplace that can conveniently hide the challenges of that business behind surprise high ad revenue. Apparently they are also trying to diversify into content creation, which seems stupid to me. I will eat twelve hats if their ""Shortz"" feature ever takes off. Seems like a big waste of time and money to me. Another thing papered over by ad revenue, which may not always be there.

Overall, they have enough users to be a good business for a good while yet. But I definitely have trouble seeing this is a something to *invest* in.

Edit: Just one more thing. Do you know how the company is defining ""monthly active users""? This is the number that matters most, but it's also easy to fudge this number. I'm not alleging anything specific against Zedge. This is just something I know in general. The core concern is that active users could be people that log in once without buying anything, or new installations that only open the app once and then delete/forget about it. For example, it would be terrible if we look into Zedge and discover that average spending per user is down despite overall revenue being up. Like I said, I don't know if this is true, and I didn't see an answer in my 5 second Google search. Having tried literally all options myself (/s), it's now up to you.",['GOOGL']
mhaez0,gsxplgr,investing,comment,1617211588,"Nicely structured write-up, but let me make some criticisms:

\-your price target must be contingent on many assumptions especially with such a young microcap company, but you did not explain what those assumptions are or what is the valuation model that you used

\-you did not quantify the intrinsic value of the company predicted by your model and why you think that the stock is currently undervalued and by how much

\-you did not consider technical factors such as current momentum and whether one would be better off waiting more or buying right now

\-you did not do a market study, an estimate of addressable market and an analysis of competitors

\-your DD is weak on analysis of risks. What can go wrong with this company ? What are the valuations that could be predicted in various scenarios ? What are the time scales of those scenarios and their probability estimates ?

\-what (if anything) could provide this company with a competitive moat ?

Imo analyzing a company is a bit like war gaming. You have to consider the unfriendly territory, competitors and macro factors (think of them as possibly inclement weather or other macro adversity in case of war) and analyze the possible scenarios and outcomes considering the best potential moves of adversaries.",['TGT']

mh4gbw,,investing,post,1617191640,"My take on Gold's longterm outlookFrom a technical perspective, gold is in a 10 year long c[up and handle](https://i.4cdn.org/biz/1617190625002.png) pattern, and it could go sideways for many more years until a breakout target of about 2900 is met. The fact that the right side of the cup is higher than the left side also is technically the most bullish form of C&H pattern.

The problem for gold isn't technical, it's fundamentals. Despite extreme money printing since 2008, USD inflation measured by CPI has been historically low. In a low inflation environment, bonds have thrived and stole the risk/reward from gold. Now after the pandemic you would have thought gold should performed well, which it did, until bitcoin started to become more accepted by institutional investors in the fall of 2020. Institutional investors generally keep their holdings at certain ratios like 50% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash, and 10% inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold can co-exist in a portfolio, but the problem is that they are fighting for the same slice of the pie which is about 10%. Until the adoption curve of bitcoin slows or inflation grows at a yearly 4% or higher, I don't see gold breaking new highs anytime soon.

Gold miners are like gold's version of shitcoins. If you want a momentum driven, lowcap,  and highly volatile version of gold, miners are for you. Gold mining is a stagnant industry with little innovation or promise of growth, their profitability hinges on the mercy of a high gold price. It looks like the miners have already priced in a gold bull market, so if gold enters another true bear market, miners are likely crashing 95% or more because their business model literally dies. There are better high reward industries with better a better outlook to spend your money than miners imo.",['TGT']

mh1zc3,gswgjxp,investing,comment,1617186949,"Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0600. Dow, S&P, Russell 2000 all hovering around their close from yesterday. Tech stocks are trying to get off the ground, with the Nasdaq up 0.3%. Bond yields are steady as well.

There just isn’t all that much to move the market. (By the way, notice how quickly we’ve already moved on from Archegos?) Earnings season doesn’t kick off for another couple of weeks and there just don’t seem to be any catalysts until then.

We do have the ADP jobs numbers for March, scheduled for release before the open. 550,000 new jobs are expected. This usually doesn’t move things very much unless there’s major deviation from what’s anticipated.

That leaves us with today’s infrastructure announcement by the Biden administration. Lots of drama around this already, as can be expected from an incoming administration’s first major piece of legislation (not to mentioned the poisoned political climate we find ourselves in).

But details of these plans have (been) leaked out already and frankly they don’t look particularly draconian where tax policy is concerned: Corporate taxes will be raised from 21% to 28%. That’s still well below the 35% level that existed prior to Trump’s tax cuts.

That’s it. Nothing about income taxes on individuals, wealthy or otherwise. Some talk about discouraging tax havens for corporations that I’m sure will be well heeded but ultimately go nowhere.

So unless the Biden administration is hiding its true intentions with this infrastructure bill, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for concern. There could of course be further policy announcements forthcoming. Maybe that’s what the market is worried about. But even then, the Democrats’ majority in the Senate is razor thin.

In the end this whole infrastructure bill may just end up being more PR than anything else. Certainly wouldn’t be the first time.","['NDAQ', 'ADP', 'SPGI', 'DOW']"

Let me preface this by saying this is not financial advice and my ‘bear case’ does not mean a 40% crash. That said:

1. We’re unquestionably in an exuberant state. Lots of liquidity pouring into markets and very, very few bears outside of the folks who see a cloudy day as a harbinger of doom. Bears have largely capitulated, which makes me nervous.

2. A substantial % of this liquidity comes from new-ish traders (mostly not buy-and-hold types) who are case studies for Dunning-Kruger. I’m not quite sure if this is net-negative or not, but at the very least it is a powder keg. 

3. There is a literal sub for GME. This one feels self-explanatory. 

4. Forward-looking rate hikes/inflation/yield volatility seems to be the only structural thing spooking US equities. This could be viewed as bullish, it could be a blowout year for GDP growth. But the underlying reality is that central banks have pumped just about every asset class there is for years and have accelerated that pace post-COVID. \*If\* real inflation jumps, the FED has backed itself into a corner RE: early rate hikes, no? 

5. Tech is objectively overbought – even proven companies like AMZN are carrying forward EPS of 50x +. Again, this could be seen as bullish, but that seems out of whack for a company that did something like 16% growth last year. 

6. We’re seeing an explosion of nonfungible goods being sold for outrageous prices. An NFT is a JPEG that is valuable because people say it’s valuable. A fiat currency with no stable value, utility, or state support. This emperor has no clothes and folks are pretending he’s wearing bespoke Kiton. 

7. The market seems to be a bit exhausted by the nonstop stimulus and spending, and I see nothing but more of that on the 21-22 horizon. Some of it will be funded via tax increases. Tons of money into the market this year, but a choppy grind sideways since end of January \*DOW notwithstanding, bless its heart for keeping me in decent shape\*

The etf is up 20% for now. 
That's higher than the usual return you get on such an etf.

What's best practice in such a case? 

1.) Realize the gains and reinvest 

2.) Realize the whole fund and wait for the (inevitable?!) correction to re-invest at a lower point

3.) Just leave it sit there and ignore it. Most likely to loose out on the unusual jump, but more likely to catch any further jumps.

I know that time in the market beats timing the market, but can't imagine that one should let such an opportunity slip (especially as it is a very young investment).

mgwrdt,,investing,post,1617159948,"Might be a good time to short the Japanese stock market. It isn’t news yet, but another state of emergency looks likely in AprilUntil now, Japan has avoided big spikes in coronavirus infections. The capital of Tokyo currently has about 300 to 400 infections a day, which is close to average since the summer. The state of emergency was just called off and things are going back to relative normal right now. next week, college students across the country will return to campuses, albeit with masks. The Government is even thinking about promoting local travel in June.

But it looks like this could be short-lived. The same Google model that accurately predicted the coronavirus spike in infections at New Year’s predicts that Tokyo will see an enormous increase in infections by April 20. Up to 12,000 a day, which is massively more than the city has ever seen.

https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/8224d512-a76e-4d38-91c1-935ba119eb8f/page/GfZpB

If true, the government will have no choice but to call another state of emergency, it will considerably impede recovery prospects. I want to bet on this, but don’t know how to do it without potentially losing my shirt. is there a simple way I could do it using my account using simple financial products?

Update: now I’m thinking about targeting smaller cap stocks that are 1) most likely to get hit by a wider, stricter lockdown than people are used to seeing, and 2) aren’t included in the TOPIX index, which the central bank buys. Stuff like WDI Corp, which runs restaurant chains:  https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3068:JP

Edit 2: The model has settled down- now 2000-2500 a day in late April. That's still state of emergency level, but regular state of emergency level, such as closing restaurants early. Maybe better to just wait this out and buy the dip.",['GOOGL']

1. ALNPY - All nippon airways adr. No options but you wanna bet might as well go big if you think travel will take a hit
2. EWJ - if you just want a market level bet.

Let me know when you place the trade. As someone living in Tokyo, I'll happily take the other side of your trade. 

Your bet is essentially based on the assumption that the reopenings, and hence valuation increase, are premature similar to some US states. 2 reasons why I disagree: 

1. Vaccinations are rolling out soon and the Japanese are no slouch when it comes to getting things done right (once they finally put their mind to it). Heck even our current ""lockdown"" just means restaurants close at 8pm, hardly a huge deal imo.

2. The largest Japanese stocks are carmakers, consumer electronics, and financial services. They aren't heavily tied to the vaccine & recovery trade (I could argue some may even be anti recovery).",

mgwz1w,,investing,post,1617160710,"FTC files suit against Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with GrailIn an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina’s (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

It is not the least cost solution, nor is it good for air quality or climate change. Not to mention that this proposed solution is to add more gas plants to solve the problem of gas plants shutting down due to cold weather and making the largest contribution to the dropoff in electricity production. This proposal would end up being an expensive, underutilized boondoggle for Texans. The solution in Texas is winterization of their electricity supply chain and more solar paired with batteries and other energy storage, NOT polluting and expensive new gas peakers. There is a reason that new natural gas plants are only expected to be 16% of new electricity capacity in 2021.",

mg9w4f,,investing,post,1617086899,"India-based plays, 3 ideas, thoughts?Hi everyone - I don't post often and mostly at all but lately as I've been looking for value plays, felt the need to plug into the hive mind and see what people smarter then myself might be thinking.

As a global play I hypothesize that developing countries will be on the rise in the next 5-10 years. I'm reluctant to do China and most of southeast asia due to heavy influence of politics, but India seems to geographically, and mentally, be positioned for best growth in the future. I want to avoid ETFs and also non-US listed companies as I think US regulation is beneficial to transparency and hopefully helps keep companies straight, at least to a point). Motivated by this thinking i took up finviz with a basic filter of India based companies, sorted by market cap, and then further looked into how the charts, analyst recommendations and social media sentiment looks. 

I landed on these three tickers, sorted into a convenient screener for whoever is interested in discussing on this post:

I'll probably do a bit of basic fundamental analysis later but I thought there might be people here who are way ahead of me.

Any thoughts on these? And thoughts on ADR premiums, as I understand they might be high when buying on US market vs. Mumbai exchange? I tried my reddit DD but posts are few and from a long time ago.",

I have a strong feeling that investing in India's startup and fintech companies is a good bet!!! My eyes are on these companies. In couple of years many of them will go public via IPO or US SPACs.

mfs7vk,,investing,post,1617032204,"Stock Scraper Trending Data as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

Management review:

* Compensation
There is a significant bonus for the Board of Director as stated in its annual report 2018:
**""The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2018, as compared to 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $65 million in personnel costs (including stock-based compensation expense), professional fees, and facilities costs to support the growth of our existing business and adjacent areas of opportunity""**

In the same period (CMIIW), the company fire 800 employee.

you can check the detail here:
https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/16/18226581/activision-blizzard-layoffs-executive-pay-unions
but I quote here
**The disparity between bottom-line executive compensation and what the 800 people laid off were making is staggering. Bobby Kotick has become the villain in this story. Kotick drew a $1.75 million salary plus another $26 million or so in stock and other equity awards in 2017. Dennis Durkin, who recently returned to the CFO role and was also put in charge of “emerging business” (figuring out where the company will make its money in the coming years), was given a $3.75 million cash bonus and another $11.3 million in as-yet unearned, performance-based equity**

Maybe this policy makes people judge The CEO, Bobby Kotick is a profit-oriented person - but honestly, which CEO doesn't?

* Destiny exclusivity for Playstation: Wrong strategy? But Bungie Games has divorced with Activision.
* Forcing microtransactions: Do it really bad? Even when the gamer doesn't like it, they keep playing the franchise.

Note:
I'm not a gamer, I play Deck Heroes, Mythgard, other TCG or CCG (unfortunately I don't play Hearthstone), FIFA (a long time ago). Thus I don't have expertise in the genre that Activision published.

Any comment would be very appreciated.

_______________________
Revision I

I will revise my view based on some member's advice. Activision Blizzard has made great games which really difficult to be replicated. Once a gamer plays specific genre or franchise, it will be difficult to switch (do the video game publisher has switching cost as economic moat?). The specific game has a large fan base and not easy to migrate to another title for the same genre.

More revision is upcoming...
_______________________
Original Post:

Economic Moat.

~~Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV.
So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.~~


Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Valuation
Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

You present several statements that raise certain questions.  For example:

1.	""Its PE ratio is similar to EA.""  It's trading at 15x book value... Why should I invest in EA or Activision if I can find a dozen or so companies that are trading at a significant discount?  You invoke the Graham/Buffett concept ""margin of safety"" but DCF analysis puts  its fair value between $71 and $78 per share.  That's the opposite of margin of safety.
2.	""has no intangible assets"" ... No? What's the $1.8 billion in accumulated intangible amortization?  You can't amortize assets you don't have.
3.	""Strong balance sheet""... what was the $18 million unrealized loss in Q3 of 2020 due to?
4.	How about the $6.8 billion in Goodwill?  That's an intangible asset.  What acquisitions are related to this and if they're still carrying this value, why would it be better for them to spend the $8 billion on more acquisitions than stock repurchases given that:
5.	"" but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance.""  Is it?  I see $11 billion in APIC.  Again: In these economically uncertain times, why would more acquisitions be better than share repurchases?
6.	""Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.""  What's the $194 million write down of AR in Q4 2020?  There's a quarterly carrying value around $83 million as a provision for doubtful accounts.  What's the connection between these two items and why could its resurgence to 2017 levels present a material impairment to their business, particularly under current economic conditions?

What concerns me is that you approach the analysis from the Graham angle of value and margin of safety, yet present no discussion of the indicators of the same.  The underpinnings of due diligence are in the data, which aren't presented or discussed in your analysis.  It's not that the above questions all have displeasing answers, but rather that these are the kind of questions you should be anticipating and addressing in your due diligence.

Due diligence is not an attempt to pitch me the prettiest profile of the company.   It's got to be a kicking of the tires, asking the tough questions, and seeing whether your hypothesis holds up to serious scrutiny.... and these are just questions I, as a relatively average FP&A guy, came up with glancing at the financials for five minutes, and it's not because I have a particular view of the company, but that is precisely the point.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

mfbyli,,investing,post,1616971610,"Investing in Helium - DMEHF DD **Investing in Desert Mountain Energy (DME.V, DMEHF)**

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

"" Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon "" Helium demand did not exceed supply last year, largely due to decreased use during the pandemic. 

"" Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining. "" Terming this companies financials as ""good"" is uh... a stretch. They raised some money (not enough to execute their plan) and they don't spend much because they aren't doing much.

"" Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day."" Test well (singular) has shown this. As mentioned previously the second well is much much worse, mostly in terms of flow rate, but the helium percentage is a bit over half as much as well.

"" Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less. ""  This seems to assume all wells are as good as the first and not as bad as the second. 

Finally, you use analysis from the cormark report here: [https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom\_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom](https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom)"" but gave a $20+ price target while ignoring their $4.25 price target.  If you're going to use their info you should probably also at least mention their price target.

I am by no means trying to convince people to stay away from this one. I just am presenting the other side for you.  You should be aware you're paying 128 million for 13 million, a plan, some leases and a few holes in the ground at least one of which seems to produce a significant amount of helium. That's pretty much how most companies start, but people should be aware this is still really early stages and a lot could still go wrong.",['TGT']

mfdia0,,investing,post,1616976808,"Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice.",['TGT']

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.

mf2pu6,,investing,post,1616944490,"Coursera: A DD IntroductionDisclaimer: This is my first DD, so please forgive any gaps, omissions, or mistakes. I welcome any and all (constructive) comments and criticisms. Secondly, as is obligatory, *this is not to be construed as financial advice*.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['TSLA', 'DE', 'ICE']"

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['BAC', 'ED', 'WAT', 'SPGI', 'GS', 'ES']"

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments.","['GOOGL', 'SPGI']"

The historical error in forecast versus realized realized 10 year return is used to evaluate the probability that stocks will outperform treasuries. I use this probability directly as an allocation target. In other words, if stocks are predicted to have a 90% probability of outperforming treasuries I allocate 90% to stocks and 10% to treasuries. If the probability is 50%, I allocated 50/50. I use a 24 month moving average of the probability to smooth the allocation and slow down transition in allocation. This slows transition from equity to bonds and vice versa. 

In general, I find that active strategies that use a probabilistic transition in allocation are more robust and easier to live with than strategies that make an all in 0% to 100% switch in allocation. Valuations don't switch instantly so I don't see why you'd want a strategy to switch allocation instantly. You're ""optimized"" 2% threshold probably has closer to 50/50 probability of either stock or bond outperformance - it makes more sense to take a 50/50 allocation until the valuation becomes more extreme one way or the other.

As you say, historically it's rare for the 10 year forecast of stock return to be less than the forecast for bond return so this strategy tends to be heavily allocated to stocks.

This incredibly simple strategy has actually been one of the most consistent performing of strategies I follow over the past 2 years.",['TGT']

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

mea4sx,gshjot9,investing,comment,1616869480,"I just bought my first shares! I would appreciate it if someone could listen to my reasoning and give me some feedback.

I decided to purchase a few shares from Avantium (AVTX). 

This company is a spinoff from Shell, and their goal is to develop efficient green industrial processes to transform raw carbohydrates from “waste” sources such as wood chips into useful chemical compounds. This is a local company and I visited one of their buildings about two years ago during a university trip, and I saw that their building is modern and well-equipped. Some research groups from my university work with them and I am aware of the work that they are doing. So I have some level of understanding of the technologies that they are developing, and I can see first-hand that the investment that they put into R&D is not being wasted. 

Their current market cap is 138 million euros.  I think that this makes it a very cheap stock, and I expect to see considerable growth. My reasoning is the following:

The company is planning to build the first commercial FDCA plant. FDCA is a sugar-derived compound that can be polimerized into a bioplastic, most notable PEF, which is a leading candidate to replace PET plastics. The industrial process relies mainly on green cyclic catalytic processes. European legislation against standard plastics and in favor of green chemical processes will incentivize companies to use FDCA in the coming years.

At the moment the construction of the FDCA is still uncertain, as they have conditionally secured only 95 of the 150 million euros of funding that they need. This represents a risk, and I think that this is part of what is keeping the share value so low. I think that it is very likely that the company will secure the funding later this year, and this should cause the stock price to increase due to the lowered risk.  
I have tried to get an idea of how much this company could be worth in a few years. I think that AkzoNobel is a nice reference, as it is dutch company that develops paints and coatings and was founded in 1994. Its market cap is 18 billion euros. I also looked at companies that produce PET, and chose Eastman Chemical Company as a reference - its market cap is 15 billion.   
I think that I am not being too optimistic when I say that the market cap of Avantium could be above 2 billion euros 10 years from now. Since the current cap is 138 million, this means that on average an investment on this company would result in an average return on investment of 40% over the next 10 years.   
Putting it in these terms and looking at that 40% yearly ROI figure makes me think that I may be being far too optimistic about the growth of the company. What should I do to come up with more reasonable predictions? Am I thinking too far ahead?   
If you read this far, thanks a lot! Any feedback would be very welcome.",['EMN']

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

I like this, I think it's a really good idea; and dealing directly with sales staff means they will pay. Companies don't always pay for quality, but they do pay for sales.

&#x200B;

Whats their addressable market? say it takes off & becomes a staple; how much will insurance companies pay them?

My concern is Insurance companies are shitty, shitty business partners to have; when you do business with a monopoly expect to get fleeced. How hard would it be for Insurance companies to replace them with their own software development teams; realistically how much can OPRX charge before they do so?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In Buffets terms; companies need a 'moat'. Nobody is going to pay OPRX **unless they have to.** How can OPRX force its customers to pay?

Also, I thought management's discussion about opportunities in EHR was pretty compelling:

""Like no other digital health platform in the market, we deliver important information in real time at the point-of-care right when clinical decisions are being made. We have access to 10s of millions of patients and most physicians, as well as the technology compliance operational support to continue to play a major role in the ever evolving digital health market.

Our partnerships with EHR and e-prescribing companies enable us to augment that physician workflow with actionable insights by providing additional real time critical information to clinicians who are dealing everyday with complex healthcare scenarios. We can improve the patient and physician experience and ultimately treatment outcomes.""

me5yvd,,investing,post,1616816797,"Canadian Index ETFs XIU - XIC - VCN - ZCN comparison 

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

 ETF                                                          AUM in Millions

 The long term performance for XIU, XIC, ZCN is similar (around 10.35%). VCN is bit lower than the rest at 10.05%.

#  Comparison volatility

Beta

 Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index – **XIU**                             0.91 

 Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp – **XIC**           0.98 

 BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp – **ZCN**                      0.98 

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

I’m looking at the book value and it’s $24.91 (1.9 ratio). To compare:
Disney: $47.20/3.9
Comcast: $19.72/2.79
Netflix $24.98/20.34

I’m sure there are other good ones to compare in the sector. I had some down at $13.50 from pandemic low’s and I did pick up more at $50. The book value is good. Their balance sheet had 2.98B cash, and they raised another $3B cash. Lots of investment opportunities for them to make with the cash.

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['TGT', 'WFC', 'BLK', 'SPGI']"

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.

But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic’s scarring.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March.

mcpqqp,,investing,post,1616645951,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['AAPL', 'NDAQ', 'TSLA', 'TWTR']"

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

>  
>The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products.

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above. 

>An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

mcqwym,,investing,post,1616650283,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Company announcement: [https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021](https://www.jefferies.com/Letters/ltr/1647/03242021)

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['MSFT', 'QCOM', 'AMZN', 'INTC']"

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.

      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

Personally it shifted my mindset from day trading to long-term investing and in general my portfolio went from trending negative to positive since. Really great lessons on how to interact with Mr. Market. It’ll also make clear the difference between investing and speculation.

I highly encourage you (and everyone really) to checkout the Podcast series We Study Billionaires. It’ll expose you to the vernacular of value investing and different mental models. The hosts are disciples of Warren Buffett who was a student of the book’s author, Benjamin Graham. Every week they have on a prominent investor that generously shares their knowledge — really educational stuff.

Feel free to PM me anytime if you want to discuss further any of the concepts during your reading. I also run a private community for new and experienced investors that’d I’d be happy to connect you with if interested. Enjoy the read, it might just change your life 🙂",['PM']

minr6j,gt66p3v,StockMarket,comment,1617391733,"It's important to specify that the underperformance of managers relative to the S&P is after fees. A few percentage points per year makes an enormous difference. 

Buffett made a famous bet that hedge funds would underperform the market over a 10-year stretch, which he won, but he's also famous for overperforming the index (on average) for decades. The standard argument is that if you take the S&P500, remove the companies that you think are worst (poor management, obsolete business model, etc.), and if you're not charging yourself fees, you could stand a decent chance of beating the market. As long as you have the temperament. 

In the real world people's emotions get the better of them, and they end up buying high and selling low. A classic example is the Magellan Fund--the fund itself grew at 30% per year, but the average investor in the fund lost money, because they weren't able to control their emotions.",['SPGI']

There's no point in writing about Deliveroo's business model, food delivery is food delivery, instead I'll share the most curious details from their IPO prospectus.

&#x200B;

1. The founder's stake after all rounds is 6.1%. The company has 6 investors with more shares, the largest being Amazon with 15.8%. At the same time the founder retains control in decision making, his shares weigh 20 times more than ordinary shares, he has 57.5% of votes. After the IPO the shares of the old investors decrease - which is perfectly logical, but the founder's even slightly increased. He got new shares, apparently some incentive clause in the old shareholder agreement worked.
2. Deliveroo's P&L is excellent by startup standards: revenue is growing faster than losses, and in the covid year the losses dropped altogether. Bottom line for 2020: revenue $1.6 billion (+54%), loss $310 million (-29%). What's more, if you tweak it a bit and throw out some ""atypical and unexpected to recur expenses"", there is almost no loss at all, a measly 12 million in 2020. Half the business is in the UK and Ireland, the other half in 10 other countries.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.

# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.
*****
> The U.S. Labor Department’s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.
*****
> The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.
*****
> The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute’s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> “Literally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We’re coming off a low base,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.
*****
> Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks — unless interest rates rise too quickly.
*****
> Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.
*****
> On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.
*****
> The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.
*****
> The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.
*****
> # All eyes on earnings
> “The macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That will be the next thing to turn to.”
*****
> He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.
*****
> First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.
*****
> Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.
*****
> “Approximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,” noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
> Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.
*****
> “In each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.
*****
> “Our work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2½–3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,” Golub wrote.
*****
> # April is far from cruelest month
Aside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.
*****
> Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that’s constructive for stocks.
*****
> The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&P 500, trading on the CBOE.
*****
> Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.
*****
> Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.
*****
> “The bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,” he wrote in a note.
*****
> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.
*****
> “April is usually good. It’s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It’s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,” he said.
*****
> Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.
*****
> The market enters the “sell in May” period during the second quarter. The market adage, “sell in May and go away,” is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.
*****
> “In that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,” Stovall said. “Tech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed’s 2% target.
*****
> The producer price index — which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output — will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.
*****
> As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.
*****
> Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.
*****
> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.

> # Stocks Love April

> “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Mark Twain

> What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Just how strong has April been lately? “I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Other than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:

> * Since 1950 it is the second best month
> * The past 20 years it is the best month
> * The past 10 years it is the second best month
> * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Taking it a step further, here’s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.

> # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After

> Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**

> # A Humble Victory Lap

> It has been a little over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It’s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.

> It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie—a lesson we always keep in mind.

> “Few on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‘what have you done for me lately’ industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.”

> Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.

*****

> # Turn Off, Tune Out

> The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.

> Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.

> Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**

> In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**

> At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.

> # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?

> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.

> As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**

> That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**

> As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.

> # Stocks and Inflation

> As we continue LPL Research’s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow’s blog, where we’ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.

> Looking at S&P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “You can’t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that’s under control is a tailwind for stocks,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.”

> Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

> The inflation question is one that isn’t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn’t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.

mj2zvr,,StockMarket,post,1617431306,"Question on drawing s/r using different time periodsSo I am a swing trader and like to hold for a few days to a week but I had some questions in regards to drawing support and resistance lines using different time periods
-

So I absolutetly love using the weekly chart to draw my support and resistance levels

My question is in regards to the daily and intraday time frames, let say the weekly resistance is at $10 and the daily or intraday time period actually brakes this level and is now climbing up, would it be stupid to jump in since the week isn't over therefore the weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 therefore I shouldn't jump in.

Summary
-

Should I stick with one time period, so if I draw s/r using weekly, I shouldn't ever check other periods, my entry/exit should be strictly using weekly? 

OR is it okay to use weekly and daily together but not use intraday? So weekly resistance at $10, and daily closes above $10, while weekly candle hasn't closed above $10 yet, wouldn't be a good idea to jump in because by the time the weekly candle closes above $10 I would have missed out on the run

TLDR
-
 trade using same time period or can we make exception to use weekly and daily timeperiods together?",

Let’s say hypothetically you worked for a contractor of property management company  and allegedly you were cleaning a public bathroom and let’s say “using“ one of the stalls which is against the rules so you lifted your legs when you heard the door open.

Once again Hypothetically this person overheard this board member explaining to his wife  how and why they needed to turn as much paper assets in to physical assets and shift as much money as possible into the names of trusted family and friends. The conversation was so panicked that the idea of staging an affair was discussed so that the wife would clean up in a quick divorce.

Now this fictional  person doesn’t care about moral or legal arguments. This person and his partner work dead-end blue collar jobs just barely paying above minimum wage. The kids go to a failing school in a gang neighborhood. They discussed the possibility of getting in trouble with the Lord and the Government and feel rewards far out way the risks.

Lets say a friend of friend new the author of this completely made up story dabble is stocks And came to that person for advice. But the author never sold a put or call never shorted a stock. The authors only experience with stock was buying a few ET’s and investing in some blue chips on the dip.

I’m definitely not asking for investment advice for a made up person about an event that didn’t happen. I’m just wondering what people would hypothetically advice this completely made up person. Please keep in my mind, they don’t have a lot of money they aren’t sure how far along the audit is or if they are going to find anything.

Now, given that I am neither American nor a legal or financial professional, I can not tell you if that could even be construed as insider trading, given that the HP is not an insider to the company. Although ratting out the board member for their insider trading might help them get off easy. As others have said, Puts might be a play here.

Another angle, depending on the size of the situation, might be to report witnessing insider trading and evidence of cooking the books via the SEC's whistleblower program. They might pay the HP handsomely for doing the right thing. In this case, the HP also might not have to worry about that anonymization stuff I talked about.

miuni2,,StockMarket,post,1617400500,"Suggestion for New Traders and How They Should Start!I have just recently joined Reddit, and in my short time I have seen a lot of new investors asking questions about where to start. I’m sure this has been posted on this massive community before, but here is my input on WHERE a new trader should start and how.

First and foremost, focus on LEARNING Before focusing on making money.

1. Get yourself a demo trading account. 
This can be done with many big brokers. Will not name any here as a simple google search will answer this for you. 

2. Read the following books:
Books are a great way to stimulate your mind and get you thinking in the right direction. Most things online try to sell you some sort of program after. Books don’t tend to do that!

- Trading in the zone - Mark Douglas
- Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard - Mark Minervini
- A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis - Anna Coulling

3 Pick ONE trading strategy. TRADE ONLY THAT for 3 months in your Demo account!

A strategy can be any of the following:
Bullish pennant,
Falling wedge,
Breakout,
Double bottoms,
Cup n handle etc

4. Track your entries, exits, targets, and why and what happens.
Tracking everything you do will give you enough data points so you can make a decisions based on what and where you should focus your energy on! Use an excel sheet!

5. Keep tracking and trading until you are consecutively profitable for 3months straight.
You want to stay consistently profitable in ur demo trading account before you go live! 



This is going to be the best and least expensive way to get you started! 

Hope that helps!!

Oh and I already love Reddit! Haha",['GOOGL']

So  I'm rather new to investing, or at least when it comes to doing my own  analysis. As you can see in the picture, I have tried to do my own  analysis of Apple (Yeah I know it is mainstream, but it was mostly to  get the method right).

I have  tried to calculate the intrinsic value based on the EPS TTM and the Free  cash flow, and as you can see, I get two different results (as I  expected I would, although the factors are the same). The stats are  taken from Yahoo finance and MSN money, and I know both methods contain  quite a lot of ""guesstimates"".

My question is therefore, what method do you find to be most reliable?

Noticed a discrepancy and did all the math by hand - the day's returns on 4/1/2020 chart was less than what it says I actually have ----

Put another way, the big ol chart you see for **today's total returns across all stocks**, says +$50 on the day.

But I did the math myself, adding/subtracting all of today's returns - and it came out to +$80

My friend did the same. He mathed his daily returns out himself to +$70, but RH says +$50.

**EXAMPLE**

**Stock A is up $1, Stock B is up $4, Stock C is up $5. Daily return at that time should say $10, but instead it says $7.**

I will note that avg prices, share counts, etc, have been consistent.

Anyone know what's up with this?

Start slow. Never lump sum. If you have a large sum then deploy 10%-20% per month until fully invested. 

Start with a broad based ETF, then pick a few individual companies to learn about and get the feel of stock picking.

Be prepared for extreme drawdowns. On average the market corrects every year or so about -10%. On average the market goes bearish every six years or so about -20% to -50%. 

You can steel your resolve for downturns. Don’t sell. Never sell unless a stock’s fundamentals or thesis has changed (if you have a big gain then sell a bit). 

Set aside an amount in your budget to invest every month. Never miss a month regardless of what the market is doing.

You could hold cash on the side to deploy when the market is down more than 10%. 

Many think of volatility as risk. Try to see market swings as an opportunity to buy a great company on sale.

Limit yourself to one speculative or gamble stock. Or set a percent of your portfolio to speculation. I limit myself to 15% for speculation. I currently have about 10% combined in EV and cannabis stocks.",

mipbo7,,StockMarket,post,1617385196,"WEEDMAPS spac (SSPK -> WMH)WEEDMAPS, often referred to as the skip the dishes or Uber eats of weed, recently SPACed onto the Nasdaq under SSPK. 

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/merger-alert-fsrv-hec-sspk-212000954.html

With the recent legalization in NYC and the already preexisting huge market in locations like Ontario and L.A. SSPK is on the right path back to the $29 SP we saw back in mid February.

Keep in mind WEEDMAPS (SSPC soon to be MAPS) is not only a cannabis play, but is mainly a tech/ad play. 

""In Weedmaps, investors see a profitable, high-margin, fast-growing ad tech and software business that happens to be tied to cannabis sales – but one that does not touch the plant.

Not touching the plant allows the company to enjoy much higher trading volume on the Nasdaq, be owned by traditional investment institutions and avoid IRS Section 280E to pay typical business tax rates.""

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mjbizdaily.com/cannabis-firm-weedmaps-aims-for-175-percent-revenue-growth/

I believe that as other states legalise the use of recreational cannabis and weedmaps is able to expand nationwide, we are going to not only bounce back to the high $20 sp but well into the $30s. However the closest catalysis is going to the closing of the merger and official ticker change. Now is the time to get inbefore the media spot light is back.

$SSPK -&gt; $MAPS

MC - 631.53m

52w range - $9.82 - $29.50

SP as of April 1 - $20.21 (after hours $20.31)

Volume on April 1 - 322,738


Devil's advocate.

My one concern right now is the low volume, or at least what I consider to be low volume. I believe this won't be an concern of mine once the official ticker change happens (hopefully sometime this month if not early May) and more people realize that SSPK is indeed weedmaps.

mij7yc,,StockMarket,post,1617366064,"Re-balancing my portfolio to withstand higher interest ratesHey guys,

As we are seeing, federal funds rates have been increasing for a few months now, and that sort of gave me a reminder that interest rates cannot remain at near 0 forever.


I began restructuring my portfolio, which is currently allocated as the following:

~ 30% Utilities.    (mostly green energy stocks) 

~ 15% Reits.

~ 20% Technology.

~ 10% Healthcare.

~ 25% spread across various sectors.


Utilities make a large portion of my portfolio because I have long perceived them as the safest, no-nonsense sector in the stock market, and I'm very risk averse.
But as I realized the possibility of rising interest rates, I began doubting my portfolio.


Since I'm a bit too heavy on utilities and reits, I believe that puts me in a bad position going forward. So I decided to cap those two sectors to 30% altogether and use some of the cash to invest in interest rate-friendly stocks, such as financials. 


I'm a long-term investor, so my questions are simple:
1. What are the implications on my portfolio if interest rates were to begin rising? How bad can I expect it to suffer? 
2. how high can interest rates realistically go looking 5-10 years forward?
3. What are there more ways to make profit off rising interest rates, or at least not get demolished by it?


Open for discussion, peace :)",
mij7yc,gt4vub3,StockMarket,comment,1617367261,Great question.  I love Utilities too. In Financials I really like USB. No Financial Fuck-ery at  USB.,['USB']
mij7yc,gt59rxn,StockMarket,comment,1617375355,"finance stocks, fintech(paypal and many new payment system). I also like convertible corp bonds. I expect interest rate has to go up to combat inflation. It is higher than Biden or Yellen says.",['PYPL']
mij7yc,gt52o6z,StockMarket,comment,1617371513,"Depends on what REITs you own. Basically all of my buys in the last six months have been REITs, and that is looking like a good decision so far. Yes, increasing interest rates might lead to short term share price weakness, but at the end of the day, most REITs are still attractively priced due to COVID. 

Predicting interest rates is a fool’s game, but my two cents on it is that if interest rates rise too much, the government will have to pay shitloads of money in interest on the national debt (8% of every tax dollar already goes to interest payments). I don’t see interest rates ever getting past 5% in the forseeable future, but I think it will probably stabilize at some point around 2-3%.",
mij7yc,gt59iha,StockMarket,comment,1617375222,"Generally, interest rates rising hits stocks two ways. First, interest expense increases now or in the future. Second, all valuations are some form of discounting future cash flow. When interest rates rise, discount rates should rise, making all valuations go down. Companies that get hit the most are companies that borrowed a lot to grow and companies that promise positive cash flow in the future. 

How far could interest rates rise? Depends on inflation. In the ‘70/‘80s the fed raised rates to ~15%. 

How to not get demolished by rising interest rates? Diversification. Everyone is worried about bonds selling off when interest rates go up and yet own stocks. Here is my experience owning BND. I bought at 84.75 (beginning of March) and entered additional orders at 84, 82, and 80. Not a single additional order has been triggered yet, while tech is off 10-20%. I bought some TIP at the beginning of Feb. it’s down 1%. 

You could also look to add something with variable rate loans like a BDC or an ETF like BIZD but these are higher risk loans.",
mi7ezt,,StockMarket,post,1617318360,"Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

1. Get yourself a demo trading account. 
2. Read the following books:
- Trading in the zone - Mark Douglas
- Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard - Mark Minervini
- A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis - Anna Coulling
3. Pick ONE trading strategy. TRADE ONLY THAT for 3 months in your Demo account!
4. Track your entries, exits, targets, and why and what happens.
5. Keep tracking and trading until you are consecutively profitable for 3months straight.

This is going to be the best and least expensive way to get you started! 

Hope that helps!",
mijiem,,StockMarket,post,1617367157,"Why choose non-voting over voting shares?Hi,

**tl;dr: why would I (or a fund manager) choose non-voting stock over voting stock?**

Background: I did some analysis on the differences in company composition between some ETFs. Let's take for example these two Emerging Markets ETFs (yeah I know one is EM and the other EM IMI):

* iShares MSCI EM IMI ESG Screened Index IE00BFNM3N12
* AMUNDI INDEX MSCI EMERGING MARKETS UCITS ETF D LU1437017350

Three examples of ISINs exclusive to the Amundi EM:

* TH0646010Z18 	PTT -REGISTERED
* TH0003010Z12 	SIAM CEMENT FOREIGN REGISTERED
* TH0765010Z16 	AIRPORT OF THAILAND PUB CO -F-

These ISINs do not appear in the iShares EM IMI, however, there we find:

* TH0646010R18 	PTT NON-VOTING DR PCL
* TH0003010R12 	SIAM CEMENT NON-VOTING DR PCL
* TH0765010R16 	AIRPORTS OF THAILAND NON-VOTING DR

I find this interesting. Before today I wasn't even aware of the existence of non-voting stock. I do get why companies would prefer to issue non-voting stock where legally possible (not diluting the vote power of existing shareholders). However, I do not understand why buyers should pick non-voting shares, especially when there are voting shares on the market as well.

**Asked differently: What could be the reason for iShares picking the non-voting shares for their EM IMI ETF, while Amundi chooses the voting ones for their EM ETF?**",['MSCI']
mijiem,gt71nh0,StockMarket,comment,1617408123,"Generally, where there are both there are more non-voting shares, so there is more liquidity, so it is easier to buy and sell when you want to. Also, the voting shares in that case are held entirely by insiders and long-term investors, so there is even less liquidity per share.👼",

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CAPL/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-CAPL/)

For   me, it's all there - reopening play that has not fully been priced in,   exposure to rising gasoline prices and demand, consistent and high   dividend payer, RSI is stable, MAs are all on point, P/E ratio among the   best out there in any industry, uptrend is steady with entry points   along the way...

This stock is   largely flying under the radar because it gets lumped in with the ET /   ETRN / EPD crowd - relatively safe, longer-term energy plays with   dividends...which it is.

BUT

It's   fairly valued - or even undervalued - moves in a sector that is   currently largely accurately priced, has plenty of room to grow as gas   prices increase - see CDC travel release today (!) - and you can tell   your family you bought it and they'll think you're not a degen from Upcountry playing with stonks like it's the floor at the MGM Grand.

Daily   trading volume is low, so price movements are somewhat stable. Last   time it flash dropped in isolation was because they announced a cut to   the dividend yield in May 2017. That is unlikely to occur again, and   certainly not in 2021.

I see this   as the perfect spring and summer accessory for your ROTH IRA brokerage   account. Let it ride and get a cool $2 in dividends a share over Q2 -  Q4  2021 ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CAPL/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CAPL/dividend/))   - note that the value of these dividends could go up 10% or so with   increased earnings due to higher gas prices and convenience store   performance. CAPL had paid upwards of $2.40 in dividends a share in 2017.

In February 2020, prior to the COVID crash, they were trading at $19.35 on gas prices of $2.50 a gallon ([https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM\_EPMR\_PTE\_NUS\_DPG&f=W](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG&f=W)). If they break through 19.35, I think we could see a return to early - mid 2017 share prices. Projections suggest gas could reach $3 a gallon in Summer 2021.

Daily   trading volume is low, so price movements are somewhat stable. Last  time it flash dropped in isolation was because they announced a cut to the dividend yield in May 2017. That is unlikely to occur again, and certainly not in 2021.

This isn't a   ""can't lose"" - but the dividend cushion means you could easily take a   scalp here of nearly $2.00 a share and break even. If you think there's   room to grow in travel - and I believe there is, at least in terms of   interstate travel by road - I believe this could be a + $3 - 4 a share   play by the holiday travel season when you incorporate dividend yield   and stock price increase, which should be wild.

***TL;DR:*** *CAPL   could offer 15 - 30% upside over the next 8 months, with roughly 10%   downside protection built in at current share prices due to dividend   yields.*","['MGM', 'MAS']"
mibh8t,,StockMarket,post,1617332453,"Why MARA is better than RIOT1.Mara has more cash flow  than riot 

2. Mara market cap is 4.1 billion and riot is 3.5 billion 

3. MARA hash rate is 10.36 EH/S vs riot 3.8 EH/s

4. Since Mara has 5x more hash rate that means they are bringing 5x more bitcoin in a day than RIOT

5. MARA mines about 55-60 Bitcoin per day not to sure about RIOT but I know they are behind and too late to catch up on MARA

6. When bitcoin is at $55,000 their revenue off bitcoin is 94 mill a month. If bitcoin reaches 100,000 it has ability to make 400 million a month. 


With that being said, you will see MARA keep going up during bitcoins bull run 🚀",
mibh8t,gt4686g,StockMarket,comment,1617342772,"Couple of things:

Marathon Digital has already reported strong top-line growth. For the first nine months of 2020, the company reported revenue of $1.7 million, which was 89% higher on a year-on-year basis. However, cash used in operations was $3.4 million for the same period.

Merrick Okamoto, Marathon’s chairman & CEO, is targeting the deployment of 103,060 miners by Q1, 2022. The CEO estimates that based on the current mining rate, a complete deployment could enable Marathon to mine approximately 55-60 bitcoins per day.


They are not mining 55-60 bitcoin per day. They are hoping to by this time next year. Also they burn a lot of cash in the process. If you are bullish on bitcoin there is no reason to not be bullish on MARA. I just have no idea how to actually value these bitcoin miners.",

mi4cv0,,StockMarket,post,1617309176,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 1, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 1, 2021**

Stocks rose today, extending gains in another record-setting session. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed above $400 for the first time ever, starting the new quarter with a bang after President Biden announced a new $2 trillion infrastructure proposal.

Today marks the first session of Quarter 2, hopefully putting to rest the volatility that dominated the market last quarter. Historically, the month of April has been good for equity markets, with the SPY gaining an average of 1.51% since 1980.

Heading into Q2, we expect cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks, whose performance is strongly tethered to the health of the broader economy, to continue driving the market higher. The last quarter saw the rotation out of tech and growth stocks as the US economy continues to gradually reopen due to the increased pace in vaccinations. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco agrees, saying “ I think we’re going to see more of the same in terms of market leadership. This is an environment in which the economy is likely to accelerate. And I think that means that we’ll see continued outperformance of areas like energy, like financials, like consumer discretionary, material, industrials — those areas of the stock market that are most sensitive to the economy.”

On Wednesday, President Biden introduced a new proposal called American Jobs Plan. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan includes spending to repair aging roads and bridges, jump-start transit projects, and rebuild school buildings and hospitals. It would also expand electric vehicles, replace all lead pipes and overhaul the nation’s water systems. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).

Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic. As a reminder, US exchanges will be closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.

**Highlights** 

* The Department of Labor released the weekly unemployment report
   * **Initial jobless claims:** 719,000 vs. 675,000 expected and a revised 658,000 during the prior week
   * **Continuing claims:** 3.794 million vs. 3.750 million expected and 3.870 million during the prior week
* [The Institute for Supply Management's March purchasing managers' index ](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-report-on-business/pmi/march/)rose to 64.7 for the highest print in nearly four decades. This came in well above consensus estimates for a rise to 61.5 in March from February's 60.8. Readings above the neutral level of 50 indicate expansion in a sector.
* A lot of clean energy stocks, that have been beaten down recently, rallied on the back of Biden’s proposal.
* United Airlines is planning to restart the pilot hiring process it halted last year as the airline gears up to meet rising travel demand, the company told pilots in a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal. 
* NIO stock gapped up 8% in the morning before falling due to better-than-expected delivery numbers. NIO delivered 7,257 vehicles in March 2021, increasing by 373% year-over-year and 20,060 vehicles in Q1, increasing by 423% year-over-year
* Elon Musk has been nominated to join the board at Endeavor as the company looks to IPO. Company works in the entertainment industry and recently bought the UFC.

mi7fcr,,StockMarket,post,1617318395,"Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days)


These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

Paysafe (NYSE:PSFE). The merger is legally official, it's going to be a massive cash cow. You've got online gambling, sports betting, big casinos shifting online, privacy payment provider e-wallets, the main branch with its own payment cards accepted internationally and seamlessly, also allowing private crypto purchases, not to mention their probability of supporting the fledgling esports igaming industry. All in one package. It is going to be colossal. Paypal is having issues just keeping their shit together with simple crypto transactions, people are pissed, moving to better providers like Square (which is also a great growth stock btw). The iGaming(online gambling) industry is already in the hundred billions of dollars per annum and Paysafe is a major payment processor at the forefront with a long and trusted track record if any of you are familiar with Neteller and Skrill formerly Moneybookers etc. 

If BFT - Foley's track record on the other hand is any example of success, they can prop it up massively. The best of both worlds as BFT is also bringing insurance and investment holding companies along with it for some icing on the cake. 

Paypal is weakening and they are falling behind in these markets, they are too vanilla and wont touch any of this and are too busy un-clusterf*cking their already KYC users frozen or blocked btc transactions, besides people want ease of use without borders and no bullshit verification processes. I had history over a decade ago working directly with the digital payment providers currently under Paysafe when online gambling was basically outlawed in North America not to mention taking client orders which we still did anyway on regulated soil (come at me FBI) Im in Canada we had authorities do walk throughs of our offices all the time. Digressing. With BFT hovering around $14-$17 which to be honest is a goddamn steal right now, once it transitions into PSFE I estimate it will hit $40+ within the first few months, with far reaching upside, smack in between 2 crazy global industries that are on fire rn: crypto and igaming.

Little ex employee insider information for you right there. 

 Jk, as i said, its all public knowledge, but these payment providers are proverbial money printers and not the bad kind and with all the Casinos shifting their business online/covid/crypto/kids stealings mom's credit card betting on their favourite twitch streamers to win at CS:GO, Fortnite,half joking. I'd say most current online betting money is in sports and poker in the 18-40 age range, you get the odd rich Boomers who drop 40k a day on coin flips or how many injuries there will be in a game, sick shit like that, who bets 40k on a coin flip? The rest are grannies hitting slots.  

The US is also lifting a lot of sanctions Federally and by state IIRC, relating to online gambling; BFT/PSFE is practically a lock. I highly suggest to anyone pick up $PSFE stock asap or at very least get some early wet feet. I personally own a few hundred and plan to buy more.",['PYPL']
mi0wcz,gt3csz5,StockMarket,comment,1617323639,Thanks for this!  I am most likely going to scoop up some call contracts on Monday. wish I had today but didn't want to hold them over the long weekend.  that might have been a mistake. lol,
mi2vza,,StockMarket,post,1617305056,"Stocks with high insider ownership are some of my favoriteInsider Ownership is calculated as the total number of shares owned by insiders (shareholders who own more than 5% of the corporation or an officer or director of the company) divided by the total Shares Outstanding.

A high value of insider ownership means that those working for the company have a large stake in the success of the company. This is sometimes seen as a sign that those running the company will work hard to ensure its success or believe the company's stock price will rise.

Overall, if there is insider buying, it could be a bullish sign for a company’s stock.

There is only one reason why an insider would buy their stock. They believe that it is undervalued and that the price of the shares will rise.

I took a look at my own stocks and found that many of my favorite had insider ownership well over 10%

1. SEC is serious about delisting Chinese stocks.  I originally thought this will blow over once the new administration comes in.  It looks like Biden will take a similar approach to China as Trump.  I also think China thinks delisting is a risk.  That is why some Chinese companies are having a second IPO in Hong Kong.

2. Chinese government will never stop interfering in these businesses.  I think the Chinese government doesn't want businesses to grow too large that they can challenge the government.

3. The Chinese EV market is even more diverse than I originally thought.  I thought NIO might be one of a few dozen EV companies, it now looks like NIO is one of a hundred EV companies in China.  And they all have some support from the government to some extent.  The government support is not to make sure these companies succeed, but to make sure foreign companies don't monopolize the market.

mi8pni,,StockMarket,post,1617322555,Thursday stock market Review (actionable) 2021,
mhql1t,,StockMarket,post,1617264415,"My unsolicited advice to the new investorTake it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. 

You need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.

1. Open webull 

2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively ""safe"" yet great returning etf. 

3. Go to the ""paper trading"" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). 

3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. 

4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. 

5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.

6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).

PRO TIPS-

-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to ""fill the gaps."" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. 

-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s 

-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. 

- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying ""BuY hIgH sElL lOw."" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. 

- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. 

-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). 

- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS 

- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. 

- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. 

- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. 

- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. 

- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to ""avoid unnecessary tax events"" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.

- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.


My advice/ quick tid bit/ plan

I attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.

My current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). 

VTI- 65% 

VXUS- 10%

SCHD- 10% 

QQQM- 7.5:

QQQJ- 7.5%

Good luck!",['AMD']

Check out the ones with the fastest growth of followers over the past month.I’ve been collecting data from major social networks - companies’ pages on FB, Twitter, Instagram, LI for 2 months. Then the collected data was aggregated into a historical perspective and I discovered 5 companies that are most actively growing in the number of their followers in the media.

This is a continuation of a series of posts related to the indirect metrics of public companies, here are the rest - [traffic’s growth](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mceny3/ive_analyzed_the_websites_of_the_top_3000_public/), [number of employees](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md7y4m/ive_been_analyzing_the_data_on_employee_growth/), [hiring dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/mfwjwe/ive_analyzed_job_openings_for_the_top_3k_public/). 

**Why am I doing this?** I believe that indirect companies' metrics are related to their stock price. When more historical data accumulates, I will try to find a statistical correlation between the indirect indicators of the company's performance (traffic, employees, ratings from employees, behavior in social networks) with its stock price and publish a post with the results of my whole research.

mhy2p3,gt1smtu,StockMarket,comment,1617296341,"What I've been saying for months, and I still believe, is that during the pandemic there was no traditional safe-haven. Gold isn't reliable anymore, there is no replacement commodity. Treasury Bonds used to be the backup, but China drove the yields down, because they have a soft currency and so they put their savings in US Treasuries as a dollar proxy. So Treasury yields were (and are) too low to be used as an investment.

So everybody herded into a small number of big-name stocks as an artificial safe-haven, driving their prices way up. They're mostly still there. The prices went down in the systemic rotation, but only as far as the rotation justified. The safe-haven money is still there, because the timing and strength of the recovery is still unclear. Without that, they don't know where to put their money. And they don't want short-term capital gains taxes, because this is mostly longterm holdings that was shifted during or right after the crash. So now we're entering the time period where they'll start considering where to move it. And with more and more people getting vaccinated, the recovery picture will start to clarify.

If Biden's infrastructure bill passes, that's going to clarify things a lot; that will be great for the economy, and in the end, great for the market. But clarity might first cause a crash, before it unleashes a young bull. If it fails, that will spook the market, while not actually providing the clarity, so that might be a smaller, more durable correction, that stays down until the crash comes in a few months. And then market recovery would rely on new stimulus.

That's my take. My VIX index is way down, but I'm holding steady.👼",

mi25oe,,StockMarket,post,1617303021,"SUNW, tread carefully.**Disclaimer:**  
I understand that solar isn't something most people care about. However, I see something, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.

I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.

Also, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.

**Moving on, Sunworks:**

* Sunworks currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.
* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.
* They completed completed fewer than 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California.
* They had an accumulated debt of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their debt is increasing.
* They do not manufacture solar panels. They are simply a solar retailer, similar to SunRun and Sunnova, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.
* They are facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.
* They're also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.
* It goes without saying, but their biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as SunRun, Sunnova, and Tesla.
* SUNW may be benefitting from solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing solar as a whole, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.

Just for context, SunRun was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.  
Sunworks was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).

**General Opinions:**

It's my belief that Sunwork's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump & dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.

My opinions on solar stocks, aside from Sunworks: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company.

My prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies > Panel manufacturers > Financing Companies > Large retailers > Small retailers.

**Wrap up:**

Credibility: I'm pretty sure I've had more solar customers than Sunworks.

TLDR: It looks bad.

Since it has come back from 29 I’ve noticed a pattern. It will have a day or 2 of 6 to 10%+ gains followed by an immediate crash. Sometimes this happens throughout the day. I remember they were looking for someone to be the permanent CEO. I guess they had a temporary one? They supposedly were going to have one by Q1 but I haven’t heard any news about it. I too am questioning why this stock keeps going up. Well, this recent spike from 13 to 17 is obviously due to the Biden infrastructure hype but how long can it last for this company? It had a good day yesterday and again today. I sold calls against it yesterday that are now down but I am confident the stock will lose steam and get back to at least the 12-13 range. There doesn’t seem to be any other catalyst as to why this stock should go up. No news. It could very well be a pump and dump combined with the new investors liking it due to the cheap price.

mhyra5,,StockMarket,post,1617293724,"Payment For Order Flow Business visualizedLet’s begin by looking at a customer who is looking to submit an order to buy a single share of stock. The process may look something like this.

https://preview.redd.it/1f8iie7n6lq61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd4c76d3e50ae7fb0624ca188c8a50873a41cea

Now we have to introduce slippage. Slippage is the money lost during trading, because the market moves in the opposite direction to the trade. Within a trading strategy, slippage is going to exist. In this case with a buy order slippage would occur when you submit a buy order but the stock price goes down during the time it takes to execute the trade. This is because there is some latency between submitting the order to the exchange and getting filled. During that time the price is being updated and it in this case it moves against the order. Let’s say that the stock the buyer is interested in trades at $100. Slippage would look something like this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/femhuvmo6lq61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=583ef94f9daffb47799733e213a3a489dd845ec2

For the most part every trader will have slippage, the only way to negate slippage is reduce the latency between the computer used for submitting the order and the exchange. That’s a whole business within itself where HFTs reduce latency via colocation and other hardware / software solutions. Also in real life scenarios slippage is probably not as big as the example for most liquid stocks.

HFTs are market makers which mean their jobs is to facilitate transactions. Essentially latency based arbitrage is when the HFT trader arbitrages between the market price and the incoming orders. They can do this because they have a faster connection to the exchanges. The process of a high frequency trader making a market for that $100 buy order would look something like this.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4m4scyp6lq61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2c15152acc4a793f1c317207bb2df64b6b75fc

There are a couple of things worth mentioning when looking at this diagram. The first is that the money that the HFT makes is not always $1, it is probably much smaller. (The FCA estimates its around 0.0042% of liquid stocks see [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ultrafast-trading-costs-stock-investors-nearly-5-billion-a-year-study-says-11580126036#:~:text=High%2Dfrequency%20traders%20earn%20nearly,investors%2C%20a%20new%20study%20says.)). Also the placement of the HFT makes it look like it can see ahead in the future, really that is to show that the HFT has a faster connectivity.

Now comes payment for order flow. Essentially what happens is that the HFT pays the broker to get a first look at the trade before it hits the exchange. The order flow would look like this.

https://preview.redd.it/0k9q38fr6lq61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5627e37eb4fa9b4dd847ec109834b3418eab8ee

Something to acknowledge is that when the order is put onto the exchange there will also be slippage as well.

Something to note is that volatility plays a huge role in market making. Volatility is the measurement for how big the price movements are. More volatile stocks are going to have bigger prices movements. So stocks with greater volatility will vary greater and which means that the HFT will find a bigger spread. An example of a more volatile stock may look like.

https://preview.redd.it/mmqz0czs6lq61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bd69c87e403553d43f1128e097cf9ff31c47fde

Without the stock prices or timeline the order flow would look like this.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zs6velju6lq61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5bcb87183880bca28ff86dc1208e4ce9bc33ca)

So where does the payment come in, and why would a HFT pay? The HFT pays the brokerage because it gives them a “look-ahead” on the order. From the HFT’s perspective its more cost-effective to pay the broker for the order flow than to find the order on the exchange and compete with other HFTs. The broker uses payment for order flow because they can offer commission-free trading. And the customer uses it because they can trade without commissions. Tracking the payments in payments looks like.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/05y7s4rv6lq61.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=2834796a63d79c85024c4dca61dc6c258290be4a)

Essentially commission-free trading exists because of payment for order flow, without that brokers would have to roll over the commission costs to the customer.

There is a reason why HFTs target retail traders rather than institutional traders. Its because retail traders are less likely to leave a trade than institutional investors with HFT. In economics terms the marginal cost of trading is greater for institutional traders than for retail traders. In more simpler terms, if a HFT makes 0.01% on trades an institutional trader trading $1bn would take a bigger hit than a retail trader with $100. From a mathematical-like approach HFTs think like this.

I was a bear on GME, shorting it, buying puts. Lost some money and learned my lessons. NOW I'm a bull. It's not too late, but a bit late as the stock is trading at 190 at the time.

&#x200B;

[GME Gain](https://preview.redd.it/ksaa2j5a4nq61.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab7d9878dca5d26d7a19dffea8fefa07db197778)

So I decided to short the puts (IT""S a BULLISH STRATEGY, READ CAREFULLY). When you \[SHORT\] a stock, you want it to go down, when you buy a \[PUT\], you want the stock to go down. BUT, when you \[SHORT a PUT\] negative and negative equals to positive. You want the stock to go UP!

WHY I Short the put instead of buying the stock? because I'm late to the game. I like the stock now, What can I do? SHORT the PUTs

**For example below**, looking at the May 21st, 2021, $180 Put, You can Short/Sell the put to the bears for $46.15.

&#x200B;

[GME Put](https://preview.redd.it/cyix8gid4nq61.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=c92c126ed0d0364f53d92af60fa46c7d7119d39b)

 

When the stock is above 180 or it went to the moon on expiration day, you earned the premium. 46.15\*100 = $4615 per contract. NOTE: you will be missing the big squeeze if you are all in with just this strategy. You will still make good money, but may not be your original intention.

When the stocks below 180 on expiration day, you have the obligation to buy the stock at $180, minus the premium you've collected $46.15. You will be buying 100 GME shares at $137.85.

**TLDR WHO is this for?** It's for someone who already bought it at the lows and wants to add more share at this level OR someone like me for a conviction trade. Tempted to buy the stock, but feels a bit late and expensive.

**WHY IS GOOD?** 1). you collect the bears' money 2) you buy more share at a lower price when it drops (FUND by the bears' MONEY)

I'm not an expert, and this is not financial advice.",

>When the stocks below 180 on expiration day, you have the obligation to buy the stock at $180, minus the premium you've collected $46.15. You will be buying 100 GME shares at $137.85.

The second you sell a put, you have the obligation to buy the stock at that price, whenever that put is exercised.  May be on expiration day, may be tomorrow.  

 

>NOTE: you will be missing the big squeeze if you are all in with just this strategy. You will still make good money, but may not be your original intention.

You conveniently leave out the fact that after a squeeze, will be a massive crash, and anybody who sold puts are going to be left bagholding GME at $135 when the price drops down to $40

There are merits to this strategy for sure, but it's risky with something so volatile.",

I'm fairly confident the bull run for Bitcoin is not over yet and will continue into this year before we see a correction.

\-Current Price of BTC around time of this post is around 58k-

**External Catalysts**

The past few weeks there have been an onslaught of positive news for BTC . To name a few major ones:

\- Paypal is now incorporating use and everyday people can exchange BTC and other cryptocurrency.

\- Square, Tesla, and several other companies have included it in their balance sheet. Microstrategy essentially embraced their whole mission around it. Overstock accepts BTC as payment.

\- Spending will be high with the stimulus package and other bills under Democrats. BTC can be seen as a hedge to the dollar

\- Visa and other credit cards have also started incorporating it.

*More importantly, there are major catalysts that will be coming this April that will likely propel it forward more:*

\- BTC ETFs are already being submitted by major institutions like Fidelity. When the GOLD ETF was introduced, the value of gold went on bull run the year to follow.

\- Coinbase IPO will be happening in April if there are no more delays. This one is **major**! Just the event will get the talk of cryptocurrency spread and be the chatter of the month.

\- Literally today Chipotle is getting in on the fun too with their Burrito or Bitcoin event: [https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day)

**Technical Analysis:**

BTC this week reached almost 60k three times this week.

Key levels of Resistance: 60k, 64.5k

Key levels of Support: 53k, 51k

Settling at 58k is very bullish at it means it is bouncing *above* the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. If it's able to hold this it should be able to get to around 62k. If it passes the mental wall there, it can easily surge to 70k before correcting. If it fails to support 55k then we could see a downside

**Tickers that follow Bit Coin: $MARA, $RIOT, $CAN**

I chose three tickers to focus on that will likely benefit from a rally. I know there are other ones like SOS, BTBT, FTFT but those are high risk from what I've seen having short reports written up on them. And when Bitcoin goes down, they go down hard. Let me know if there are any new tickers that follow Bitcoin too.

**MARA**

\- Bitcoin mining company I've been following since it was 5$. Has strong support

\- Recent News: To Launch the First North American-Based Bitcoin Mining Pool.

\- Reached a 52week high over 50+ today

**RIOT**

\- Same as MARA a crypto mining company I've followed since it was 10$. It's always been slightly ahead of MARA but it seems the gap is closing.

\- Recently reported GREAT earnings 300% surprise in EPS

\- Heavily shorted (20%) which may be why it has not been climbing as hard in following BTC, but will easily soar multiple levels if Bit rallies hard enough.

\- Reached over 70 last time BTC ran

**CAN**

\- The only Chinese stock I singled out that could see a strong run correlated with Bitcoin if it were to run this month.

\- Canaan manufactures equipment used for mining Bitcoin. As the price rises, more and more companies are enticed to mine.

\- Reached around 40 last time BTC ran

*Bearish Warning:*

\- In the past when Bitcoin has ran, there has always been a big correction afterwards. Invest at your own risk.

\- Offerings can happen if the price climbs too much","['TSLA', 'PYPL', 'GPS']"

Keep an eye on internals if the open high and diverge from price on a slight decline look for a rounded reversal later today.

mhpdz5,,StockMarket,post,1617259048,"Tesla 2021 DDTesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA) has been really moving upwards from 2020 March, going up by over 743% and burning hedge funds with short positions on them. It had reached a high of 900 post split coming around a valuation of approx., 880B dollars and then has gone down by over 15% this year. They are aiming to deliver above 800,000 vehicles over the year 2021, and are expected to deliver around 170,000 vehicles this quarter. Extrapolate it and it gives the number of around 680,000 vehicles excluding Giga Austin and Giga Berlin which haven't been fully developed yet and will be starting production for May and July 2021 respectively.   


As per them going to India, there is serious competition from Hyundai, Volkswagen and Maruti Suzuki. India's roads aren't the best for self -driving because you can never see it but there are people who absolutely don't follow rules, and cattle and random animals just keep entering the street when you least expect it. So, self - driving software won't exactly be too much of help in India even if the Government changes the rule that currently prevents any self-driving tech on vehicles due to the less jobs in India. We also don't have the charging infrastructure to support the electric vehicles and also it being a luxury car, only the rich and prosperous can afford it since the people who can afford it are 1% of the working population of the country. This means that Tesla is going to be having a tough time in India and won't be able to sell more than 50-100 vehicles over the next few years.   


As for their fundamentals, their earnings has been down the last quarter with a 15% lower EBIT from the third quarter, and it looks like their third quarter is going to have the most sales this year too. As for the technicals TSLA could be caught in a bull-trap. The stock has been up a good 5% due to high expected deliveries but it is highly likely to underperform and get lesser sales than the expected 170,000 cars. The volumes have been significantly decreasing over the past year and there are strong resistance lines, also forming a bearish pennant pattern and has hit the resistance line 3 times as of yesterday in the daily time frame. There is a strong sign that Tesla might break out downwards over the next few weeks. 

&#x200B;

Assuming 90% of their sales this year is also going to be the Model 3/Y sales their average profit being around 15k USD per car their earnings are going to be around 11.34B dollars and 2.6B dollars for their Model X/S, accounting for total earnings of about 14B dollars, and at a P/E ratio of 14 they will be worth around 196B dollars if this is fulfilled only with respect to their automobile sector. In this DD I haven't taken the energy sector into consideration and I assume their energy sector to be around 50B dollars in worth, which results in a worth of around 250B$ and a price target of around 260$ a share. I am also slightly on the optimistic side for tesla where other investors like the Legend Michael Burry says it could go down to below 100$ and other analysts around the 150-180$ mark. Either way, even the highest analyst rating is around a third of it's current traded price.

This is a gas and oil stock. AR is currently trading at about half of it's book value of $20+. The charts show a nice set of railroad tracks with some recent drops. It appears the stock is primed to rebound. I see this stock hitting $16-$20 by the end of 2021. Right now I think it could possibly be getting ready to begin trading above the 20 day EMA again.

**Companhia Siderurgica Nacional 'CSN', ticker symbol SID**

**Unum Group, ticker symbol UNM**

This insurance stock has been trading in an upward channel for the past five months. It recently found support at the previous resistance level of $26. I'm watching this one to see if it can continue the trend and push up toward $30-$32. [UNM Daily Chart](https://imgur.com/diekhSI)

ETFs are not a bubble, full stop. But here are the two problems I see with them in extreme circumstance. 

1. Volume drought in times of distress - if the market drops precipitously (I’m talking 3 circuit breakers in a day kind of thing) ETFs can face significant spread widening that hurt the sellers and benefit the buyers. No matter what the ETF holds, it could be the most liquid stock in the world, the price you pay in influenced by the volume of that instrument. 

2. Price parity fails in times of distress - similar to point 1, if we find ourselves in a times of crazy volatility, we could see ETFs trade at crazy premiums or discounts to their NAV just because of the sheer chaos underlying the market. This can also hurt people who use the instrument as well. Usually this issue is arbitraged away by algos but still, the risk is out there.",

We have 2 types rock base REE which is expensive to process/mine and has radioactive tailings which can be an added expense or much lower Capex - Clay Based REE.

In Uganda an Australia company **Ionic Rare Earth's Limited** listed on the ASX ticker **IXR** has announced that it has a massive deposit, in fact the worlds biggest deposit and it's on the surface. The company is drilling again now so the resource will double again as early indications are very positive.

The rare earth minerals are in huge demand by China, USA, India and Japan. Obviously these 17 critical minerals are needed for mobile phone, medical, military missiles and weapons and space exploration and in massive demand and world shortage. Independent brokers are saying that the SP of 5c AUD will triple in weeks as the company is about to release it's important Scoping Study which will assist to coming into production fast tracking this by off take agreements which imo will happen very soon. 

Importantly the world needs to urgently secure supplies of Rare Earths REE and the USA under the new Quad agreement recently signed by the USA, Australia, India and Japan, are urgently focused of preventing China's dominance of these minerals. The great thing is Australia's biggest hard rock REE company Lynas LYC has secured deals with USA. 

The China v's world is heating up over Rare Earth REE guys so worth having a look at REE companies like IXR is the best imo, then we have Canadian VML who are going into production after raising $43 Mil and little specy stock EMT, all seen on [www.asx.com.au](https://www.asx.com.au) and commentary on Hot Copper Australia.

We've expected the early gains to the upside be capped below $9.70. The market has managed to cap ZKIN gains at $9.47 as double top was formed. After the price failed to break this pivot resistance, a bearish momentum came.

As of the price stands now, the break below $9 is suggesting a further drop $8.60 as the short trend is a trend of lower highs and lows.

After price tests $8.60 area, a correction to $9 is expected and then a move possibly to $8.40 area.

Indicators are pretty bearish.

MACD gave a strong sell signal and the bearish momentum keeps increasing.

RSI has broke below 40 and failed to broke back, resulting in increased bearish momentum.

The overall short term trend has turned into a downtrend as the EMA's started giving a sell signal. A strong break above $9 would be needed to change this outlook.

4H MACD is currently trying a change into a buying wave, if the price of ZKIN goes down from here, a third second selling wave on key 4-hour time frame will be seen, pushing the price to above $7 with dips even lower.

The 15m outlook bias is bearish and we look for losses to extended as there is no technical reason for a move to the upside.",

Disclaimer: I am not a financial or investment advisor.

Disclaimer: This is a monster stock.

Note: I have attempted to pull together the business case and investment thesis and summary of recent compelling events based on the work of many in the MicroVision community r/MVIS, including u/S2upid and u/BigBlackWifey to name a few, with the intent of spreading the word about this great company with massive potential.

Many of you may have first heard about MicroVision due to the recent news of the $21.9B US military contract awarded to Microsoft for over 120,000 IVAS/HoloLens 2 headsets over the next 10 years. 

This is significant for MicroVision because their tech is in these headsets. We know this because the now legendary Hololens 2 tear down by u/S2upid:[S2upid Hololens 2 Teardown](https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown)

This is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.

Full article: [Microsoft Wins US Army Contract CNBC](www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

This deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision’s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...

The big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR for with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.
The company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. 

[10 Signs Your Company is About to be Acquired](www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired)

Let’s connect some dots...

Summary of the recent compelling events:

Note: Some of the below DD based on summary from u/t-jameson-corazon 

Feb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. 

June, 2020 - Dr Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google.  Dr Spitzer is the leading AR expert in the world and came out of retirement to be a part of MicroVision’s journey.

Q3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.

Dec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.

Judy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Judy Curran is very pragmatic and would not join the board of a failing company. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.

Ford and Google have a strategic partnership.

2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES).

Ford is based in Michigan.

2/5/21 - Blackrock buys 2.4 million SHARES.

Mid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR.

Feb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate a Merger and Acquision. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout - This is BAFF (Bullish as Fucking Fuck).

March 2nd, 21’ - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz.

Seval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. 

Oz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]'s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google’s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  

Seval Oz - “I am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive LiDAR technology and explores strategic alternatives.”

Seval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC yet. Seval Oz would not just join the board of a failing company, and she certainly would not join the board without compensation. The only logical reason for her not filing a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC already is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). This is BAFF.

Several BoD’s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock.

Sumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals. 

Direct quotes from the earnings call on March 11 with [transcript](https://tinyurl.com/ECTranscript)

“The ability to deliver a high performing long range Lidar sensor that is designed to meet or exceed current OEM requirements”

“The scalability of our sensor to meet future price targets”

“I believe that adding these new expertise and insight to our current board, to augment existing expertise in business, including expertise in mergers and acquisition, strengthens our ability to create value for our shareholders”

“We’ve pioneered scalable solutions that we believe are far ahead of global competitors”

“The impact and value of what we’ve achieved was hard to measure (insert SS chuckle) since there were no competitive solutions for these verticals”

“Our automotive Lidar product addresses an emerging market segment that has the potential to impact millions of lives, in mobility and safety, with potentially billions of dollars in sensor and ? sales for OEM’s, and multi national technology companies over coming decades”

“With such capabilities, in our first potential product, we believe a future product could then include a Lidar, and a camera module, combined in a single sensor”

“As I mentioned in our call last October, regarding our A sample timing, we expect the hardware for demonstration, along with select benchmark data from our development platform, will be available to interested parties, in our April timeframe, followed by complete benchmarking and testing. I also expect that a version of our solid state long range Lidar sensor could be available for sale, in small quantities, in Q3 or Q4 this year”

“Our solid state long range Lidar sensor could enable any interested parties to perform testing, with our sensor, on their platforms, such as cars, and long haul trucks”

“We expect to establish a pilot line with appropriate capacity to demonstrate scalability as we have done over the last decade for multi technology national partners. Let me be specific on this. Our capabilities include delivering ? maps, control plans, supply chain partnerships, automation, and product integrity qualification, for high yield design, that can ramp”

“In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders”

“I am profoundly optimistic”

“During the year ending Dec 21st 2020 we applied a total of 2 million dollars against the prepayment”

“We anticipate the financial statements that we will be releasing shortly, will no longer have a going concern opinion” (have since been released)

“On our April 2017 customer, we are expecting that royalties in 2021 will increase over 2020, and we’re rooting for that product to do well” (note April 2017 customer is Microsoft (22 Billion doable contract awarded last week)

“We are a stand alone company right now, but we’re up for sale”

“I’m always optimistic about the company. A year ago, where we were, people asked, what do you think, you know (insert SS chuckle) Microsvision, you know, even back then, I think it’s worth billions”

“I’m trying to draw the bigger picture of how important it is to actually solve these problems in these segments”

“I want to be very crystal about what we’re working on, and our commitment to strategic alternatives”

“If you solve a key problem, and your extremely valuable, of course I’m optimistic about the company. Hugely optimistic about what it can enable”

“The demonstration would be for potential customers or other interested parties. It’s not a public demonstration per se, but for folks that were in conversation with”

“This is a fight for the future. The last time I remember feeling this kind of excitement was what we call the internet age in the late 90’s, mid 90’s, where we knew that there was a big revolution that would impact everyone’s life, so I’m excited. All of us are”

“This is benchmarking data that is provided for interested parties”

“Everybody’s thirst for data, will be done, who is working with us under NDA”

“...we need to give confidence to customers, people, you know, perhaps in a strategic transaction”

Summit speaks lots of words, translation, “less fiddly bits”

“Save millions of lives, and make billions of dollars over decades”

“The process continues, but we will not be commenting on any specifics”

No fireside chat after Q4 2020 earnings call (They typically have had these but it seems they are trying to say as little as possible, a sign of a buyout being negotiated).

David Allen/Investor Relations, has not been able to answer most questions over email or the phone.

Yalon Farhi - BoD who’s funds kept MVIS alive steps down and retires.

Yalon Farhi hasn’t sold.

David Westgor stepping down as VP General Counsel. He is staying on in a consulting role until June.

From the Press Release: “I will be stepping back from my current role but will continue to provide support to the Company on a consulting basis through June as the Company transitions to a new general counsel.” (Presumably the new general counsel from the acquiring company - This is BAFF).

(See #8) [10 Signs Your Company is About to be Acquired](www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired)

David Westgor hasn’t sold.

Steve Holt (STEVE HOLT!!!)/CFO, exercised his options to buy shares at $17/share a few weeks ago... very interesting that he would choose that time to exercise them... This is BAFF.

Seval Oz still hasn’t filed a Form 3 or 4.

LIDAR A-sample reveal in April (April is here) [MVIS Countdown](https://www.mviscountdown.com/)

Chris Grayson thinks Niatech (Google owned) has “a confident guess” that they will be using MicroVision light engines.

3/30/21 - MicroVision follows Elon on Twitter.

The proposed Government infrastructure bill is good for EV and autonomous driving growth tech.

Naked shorts and MM’s are driving the pps down.

Nobody is defending the price.

Not even counting patent filings for lasers and scanning devices from MANY interested parties ranging from US to a GLOBAL scale.

We know there is significant short interest against MVIS, in fact several short firms have been very vocal about being short on MVIS. Based purely on the P/E ratio, it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy, however, MVIS value is not in the current earnings, it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech.

From a TA perspective, we are seeing bullish divergence on the weekly chart. We are making higher lows on the weekly and lower lows on the RSI. This is bullish divergence and a sign that another breakout is coming soon... Also, the shorts will be forced to cover soon, which will cause a short squeeze. Wait until the A-Sample PR drops... let alone the buyout PR...

Tesla crashing causing increase in liability and eyes pushing for regulation.

Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, “they have better tech then Luminar.”

MVIS is considered a Mid-Cap stock since its market cap is over $2B. This has let to a further increase in institutional ownership.

Russell indices reconstitution coming up in May. Today MVIS isn't in any Russell indices since it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several.

More and MORE FUD across all platforms. The only real argument is that we don’t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.

That’s about to change...

Luminar (LAZR) LiDAR is currently valued at $8B, they were $10B prior to the tech correction, and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs, size, and scalability. Therefore, we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8-10B ($51-$63.50/share). I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR, so I am estimating $75-100 pps for the Auto LiDAR vertical. That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals. MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents. My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share.

AEVA is the new kid on the block, recently went public via SPAC. Founded by ex-Apple guys, so they have generated some buzz snd have a current market cap of $2.6B. AEVA also has 4D LiDAR, their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system that integrates onto a chip. Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market. AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024. MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA... 3 years...

MicroVision regarding their LiDAR:
“We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters, and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This equates to 520 points per square degree.”

This week's top stock and its DD: Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM)**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: **130%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **324%**

Average sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

The company is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world’s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).

&#x200B;

[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)

As you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world’s made-to-order chip market.

**Financials**

TSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4’20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)

They also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1

TSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).

This leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management’s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.

**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV’s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.

**Risk and Competition**

There are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.

The company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan’s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC’s EPS as \~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.

A long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)

**Conclusion**

TSMC is currently one of the world’s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC’s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!

mikm42,gt555gv,wallstreetbets,comment,1617372907,"Hello, just swinging by and saw one of my favorite topics mentioned, fabrication strengths.

For those not into tech, you may not realize that 10nm/7nm is more or less a marketing number - it only measures the distance between transistors in one dimension.  What actually matters is the *transistor density*, which measures transistors/sq mm (two dimensions) instead of just one.  Intel's 10nm has slightly better transistor density than TSMC 7nm, and Intel 7nm will be slightly better than TSMC 5nm, so in reality **if both company's timelines hold** Intel is only one process node behind TSMC.

Although Intel is definitely behind TSMC as far as fabrication is concerned it doesn't actually matter that much.  This is because typically TSMC's leading generation is sold out to Apple, which means that for third parties, the difference in choice of fabrication technology is negligible.  Of course, this part only applies once Intel starts accepting orders from external companies (currently Intel only produces its own products in its own fabs).

**TLDR**: Intel being behind on process node doesn't really matter because 1) at the moment they only make their own products and 2) their only products in need of a cutting edge node are in their CPU division, which are still remaining competitive for now.  

Please note that anything written above not already released by their respective companies may change without notice, and OP's financial disclaimer still applies here too.  Overall, I do agree with OP (also, nice post!), but I wanted to point out that the difference in fabrication technology is closer than the layperson might tell.  Finally, fuck this tiny window to write text in.

Edit: In case if process node is a new term to anyone, if someone is referring to Intel 10nm, that's a process node, while a process node advancement would be moving from Intel 10nm to Intel 7nm (Or TSMC 7nm to 5nm, but you get the point).","['AAPL', 'INTC']"

miz2ya,,wallstreetbets,post,1617415476,"RKT's pivot point in 3rd week of AprSo I see a lot of people complain about RKT's price action - it looks like it's continuing its trend of trading sideways with an oscillation since its IPO, even with the large spike on Mar 2nd. However, I just want to remind everyone that we have not completed an oscillation cycle after the big spike. I will do a quick FFT analysis to get the frequency of oscillation and show that the 3rd week of April is the turning point. I will discuss the two outcomes: if RKT continues its oscillation (short term bullish), or if RKT wants to trade with a new regime (unclear outlook).

RKT closing price since IPO:

Taking the Fourier transform, and then fitting the low frequency peak with a Lorentzian:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ax7qu55d7vq61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd03ddb621dc581b6e2ac2e15d4e615f1846d8c

We get the following parameters of the lorentzian:

y0	=25.305 ± 2.89

A 	=0.012523 ± 0.00457

x0	=0.032551 ± 0.00155

B 	=0.00015029 ± 6.38e-05

&#x200B;

x0 is the peak center, and a frequency of 0.032551 (1/trading days) translate to a period of 30 trading days. From the Mar 2nd spike, which is very well-defined, we get Apr 14th as the next point in the cycle.

As we look to be currently in the trough of a cycle, there are 2 possibilities:

1. We continue the oscillation cycle, meaning that we will turn bullish over the course of the next week or 2. This can be caused by swing traders and technical traders anticipating the end of this cycle and turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
2. It's possible that others already consider the big spike to have broken the cycle and RKT doesn't continue trade with the oscillation. This can be both bearish and bullish, but at least we will trade in a new regime and people can stop complaining about how RKT is trading sideways.

I personally think RKT will likely continue to trade with the oscillation, because the big spike happened to occur at the same time as the bullish part of the cycle, which would reinforce the oscillation. I think there needs to be a big piece of news at the trough of the cycle to break it.

Edit: the main point of this analysis to provide the time frame where you can look for this continuation or breakout. I provided a short argument for why I think it might trade a certain way, but you should decide how you want to trade RKT.",['MAR']

mircj0,,wallstreetbets,post,1617390916,"Canadian Lumber Stocks 🪵🇨🇦**Lumber Sector**

First of all the lumber sector is booming right now so the lumber companies have been doing very well because of it. Right now lumber prices are skyrocketing as we are seeing lumber futures above $1000 once again making new all time highs. Lumber is in high demand as covid has caused a lot of these companies to not be operating at their maximum so there is a shortage on supply. A lot of these companies stock prices have surpassed their 2018 highs while others are nearing it. A big reason why lumber stocks peaked in 2018 and have decreased since is because of the new laws and regulations that have caused higher tariffs on their revenue, sales, etc. In 2020 the new stay at home lifestyle has caused people to take on new projects such as building a new deck for their backyard, or renovating their house as a whole. Canada has seen a huge housing market boom because of the shortage of supplies and people have been upgrading their houses to put in on the market and make a profit. Not to mention the increased immigration once Covid settles down which will spark a increase in building of new homes. Lumber prices won't be going down anytime soon and I believe it'll maintain these prices for 2021.

**Lumber Stocks**

Right now I see a company that is severely undervalued when compared to its competitors and that is Canfor Corporation, $CFP on the tsx. \*Note all numbers are expressed as millions of dollars\*

&#x200B;

[Canfor 2020 Financial Reports Summarized ](https://preview.redd.it/6srhobyp4tq61.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae213b4863e40a8862e4100903e2bd5ca32f8624)

As you can see their revenue and shareholders equity have been increasing quarter over quarter at a nice rate. Their price per book is looking good and their market cap in comparison to their quarterly revenue is also extremely good. Now let's compare it with Stella-Jones, $SJ and West Fraser Timber, $WFG.

&#x200B;

**Analysis**

There are some key differences that we should make note of:

\- SJ and WFG both are trading at much higher price/book than Canfor.

\- Canfor is posting much higher revenue than Stella Jones (nearly doubled) yet is trading at nearly the same market cap.

\- Canfor and West Fraser have nearly identical revenues and net income yet West Fraser is trading at an 11 billion market cap while Canfor is trading at a 3 billion market cap.

**Conclusion**

In all honestly you could buy just about any 3 of these companies and you'll make a decent ROI in 2021. However, Canfor appears to be the most undervalued amongst its peers and offers the highest value. This isn't financial advice as what has said is just my mere opinion on the matter.

Here over the next week, possibly Monday. interim Phase 3 II data will potentially be released for Covaxin and an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) application will shortly follow for the USA from OCGN. (**Major Catalyst**)

If you take a look at when Phase 3 Interim II results came out for Pfizer's vaccine they were only about a month apart.

**OCGN**

Will receive royalties for the vaccine, COVAXIN, at a 45% rate from all sales in the USA, from a partnership with a well know vaccine maker Bharat Biotech. **USA EUA Submission timeline is April**.

I am expecting Interim Phase 3 II results for Covaxin within the next trading week, from the timeline given in the above Pfizer example.

Covaxin plays an important role because it is one of the only vaccines that has been shown to have a high defense to current and potentially future mutations of the virus.

mionc6,gt5wli2,wallstreetbets,comment,1617386662,What exactly is PLTR working on AWS?,
mionc6,gt6mv8m,wallstreetbets,comment,1617400006,"Ok - so here's what this may mean for PLTR stock.

When a company announces they partner with AWS, it means 1 of 2 things:

1 - they are going to host their product on AWS. Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.

Minimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.

2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).


Now - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.


How are #1 and #2 related?

Let's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). 

That said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.


What does this all mean for PLTR stock?

Nothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:

Job postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.

PLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)

Announcements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS

PLTR Announcing professional services/consulting 

PLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace


If one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.

I write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.

BTW- contino is far from what I'd consider reputable in the sense of using it for any DD. Lol","['CDW', 'GPS']"

These are entertaining, and generally we consider these as proof of positions. But they shouldn't be. I'm no inspect element or photoshop expert but it wouldn't be too difficult to fabricate postions simply for internet clout (""oh look at me! I have 500k in the game!!!""). 

I consider this an issue, simply because false claims are essentially fraud in the financial world, which could be damaging for this sub, legally damaging for the individuals doing the fabricating, and influential for those who believe all these posts are real.  

So i am not sure if this issue has been discussed before seriously, but I believe it has to be brought up. We need better ways to authenticate positions. I don't exactly have the answers to this. Maybe we are living in an age where deep fakes are just so good that we may never tell (see the fbi issuing a warning about deep fakes of zoom calls for businesses). But there has to be some way, while keeping anonymity. Screen recordings appear to be harder to fake and thus more believable but that's not a 100% fix as i believe there are, again, ways around it. 

At the very least, if you are looking at positions/yolos posted here, be skeptical. Yes some people have a lot of money to throw around, but there are definitely fake posts rising to the top just because the numbers are big. Do your due dilligence not just in a stock, but on the posts you see here.

mir9fp,,wallstreetbets,post,1617390662,"UNIT DD - COMMUNICATIONS/INFRASTRUCTURE PLAY - FIBER/REIT - AMERICAN JOBS PLAN - MICHAEL J. BURRYHi Everyone, I have been a retard on here for almost a year. Mostly just a lurker and upvoter but decided to start doing some DD. Looking forward to feedback and discussion on this stock.

**EDIT 1:** u/dickpal made note that Blackrock and Vanguard are not direct backers but are the largest shareholders due to their ETF’s they manage and the fact that UNIT is a part of those ETF’s make them the largest shareholders

**EDIT 2:** Uniti signed a deal with Dish Network in November 2020 to help them roll out their 5G network

**EDIT 3:** u/mikecm11 pointed out their EPS was (-3.47) which appears to be a bad thing. However after looking into it it appears **REIT's valuations are calculated differently** than regular stocks where EPS is not very important and use number's like **FFO** to calculate their true value when compared to other REIT's. There is an article here [*https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/reits/reit-investing-101/7-valuation-metrics-you-need-to-know/*](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/reits/reit-investing-101/7-valuation-metrics-you-need-to-know/) which explains more. It looks like it may take me a little while to fully understand the meaning behind each calculation and compare it with UNIT's performance. But that is a starting point for anyone who is interested until I am able to gather more details and post it.

**TL;DR for retards at bottom**

\&#x200B;

I am going to break this DD down into 4 parts.

1. **The Company**
2. **The American Jobs Plan (Infrastructure Plan)**
3. **The Stock**
4. **Short Squeeze Possibility**
5. **Price Action**

This may be a somewhat ""boring"" play. But with Yields going up and the economy recovering, big money is pulling out of risky growth stocks and putting it into boring value plays.

**1.  The Company** \- UNITI GROUP INC.

**TKR: UNIT**

""Uniti's mission is to provide critical communications infrastructure needed to seamlessly connect the world.""

""Uniti Group Inc. (Nasdaq: UNIT), an internally managed real estate investment trust, is engaged in the acquisition and construction of mission critical communications infrastructure, and is a leading provider of wireless infrastructure solutions for the communications industry.

***What is a REIT?***

According to [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp)

""A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs pool the capital of numerous investors. This makes it possible for individual investors to earn dividends from real estate investments—without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves.""

""REITs can play an important part in an investment portfolio because they can offer a strong, stable annual dividend and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. REIT total return performance for the last 20 years has outperformed the S&P 500 Index, other indices, and the rate of inflation.﻿""

**Uniti Fiber**

**2. The American Jobs Plan**

This last Thursday, President Biden unveiled his plans for a 2.2 Trillion dollar infrastructure plan, which includes plans on how to :

Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems. Deliver clean drinking water, a renewed electric grid, and **high-speed broadband to all Americans.**

One of the goals of the plan is to:

**Build high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach 100 percent coverage.** The President’s plan prioritizes building “future proof” broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas so that we finally reach 100 percent high-speed broadband coverage. It also prioritizes support for broadband networks owned, operated by, or affiliated with local governments, non-profits, and co-operatives—providers with less pressure to turn profits and with a commitment to serving entire communities. Moreover, it ensures funds are set aside for infrastructure on tribal lands and that tribal nations are consulted in program administration. Along the way, it will create good-paying jobs with labor protections and the right to organize and bargain collectively.

The plan includes providing **$100 Billion dollars** to build this infrastructure.

\&#x200B;

The fiber optic network in the United States is worth about $5 Billion in 2020, now if we UNITI were to grab even 1% of the proposed $100 Billion, that could **increase their market cap by about 30% or more**

[*https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/fiber-optics-market-238443438.html*](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/fiber-optics-market-238443438.html)

\&#x200B;

**TL;DR Pt. 2 - The American Jobs Plan could provide the opportunity and capital for UNITI to grow much more rapidly in size within the next several years**

**Michael J. Burry** (Scion Asset Mgmt.) - If you haven't been living under a rock the past year you know who this man is. Currently UNIT is his 7th biggest position in his portfolio -

*data from* [*https://whalewisdom.com/filer/scion-asset-management-llc#tabholdings\_tab\_link*](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/scion-asset-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)

***ETF Exposure -*** According to [*https://www.etf.com/stock/UNIT*](https://www.etf.com/stock/UNIT) Uniti is being held in **78 U.S. - traded ETF's.** and has around 45.8 M shares in the U.S. ETF market. The largest of which is iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (**IJR**) with approximately 15.38M shares. Another notable ETF's include the **IWM** and **VNQ** with about 4 million shares each.

Bonus - It also pays 0.6 dividend

\&#x200B;

**TL;DR Pt. 3- UNIT is backed by some pretty smart investors, including Blackrock, Vanguard, and Michael Burry**

\&#x200B;

**4. Short Squeeze Possibility**

*According to fintel* [***https://fintel.io/ss/us/unit***](https://fintel.io/ss/us/unit)

Short Interest as of 3/15 is 7.49%

However, days to cover is at 4.18 due to low volume in this stock.

If 85% of the float is owned by institutions, that means 85% of 225 million is about 191 million. Which leaves about 34 million shares remaining.

If we say only 1 million WSB subscribers actually are active and have money to spend, they could potentially grab hold of the free float market share

1 Million x 34 shares each ($383) = free float capture = squeeze.

Not to mention the options market and a gamma squeeze possibility. If you look at the options chain there is only 2,216 open call contracts which expire 4/16. And there are open contracts available in $1 increments and are dirt cheap ($5). So a couple hundred thousand contracts OTM ($12 - $20) spaced out evenly by some retards definitely has the potential for a wicked gamma squeeze.

\&#x200B;

**5. Price Action - On friday close I saw some very interesting price action.**

It bounced up and down all day basically from $11.00 to $11.15 extremely consistently until about 12:30 when the price rocketed from $11.00 to $11.28 at close. Now, this could've been shorts covering, or people getting ready knowing it's about to take off soon.

The last minute of the ticker saw some wicked buy orders of about 250k shares.

\&#x200B;

\&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

**UNIT looks like a solid fundamental investment, backed by Smart money like** **~~Blackrock, Vanguard, and~~** **Michael Burry. In addition the American Jobs Plan provides a tremendous opportunity for this company to grow it's fiber optic network and leaseback opportunities. On top of that, a squeeze play is also quite possible, both with short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It may be boring but growth looks like it's fading and value is becoming the name of the game.**

mij812,,wallstreetbets,post,1617366071,"It's a solid play...Ok, this is gonna be a very simple bit of DD...

The subject is our favourite stonk... You know the one...

Now, there's a lot of very optimistic DD out there, and sometimes I feel that does more harm than good... So here is a simple pessimist DD from the point of view of someone who does believe in the squeeze...

Now essentially every stonk play is gambling... The key to successful gambling is balancing risk vs reward... The ultimate example of this is if you imagine a standard, fair, coin toss. If someone said: ""for every dollar you bet on the coin toss, if you guess right you get 1.1 dollars and if you guess wrong you lose your dollar"", then in that situation the right play would be to take that bet over and over again for guaranteed infinite money in the long run...

So that's what successful gambling is all about. Making these probabilistically sound bets over and over and over...

Now let's apply that to the stonk in question... In a very simplified yet reasonable, though pessimistic, way...

Let's take a conservative top for the short squeeze to be $1000 and a conservative likelyhood for that outcome, given that you believe it is a serious possibility, of 25% chance of that squeeze happening.

Let's also take a pessimist worst case of $0 price for this stock without the squeeze happening at all, and a pessimistic probability of that happening of 25%...

And let's take a conservative case of the stock simply drifting down to it's price target of $170 and staying there, with a remaining likelihood of 50%...

Let's then assume that the average buy in price was an expensive $200 dollars...

So the total expected value of the play is as follows:

TEV = (1000 - 200) * 0.25 + (170 - 200) * 0.5 + (0 - 200) * 0.25 = 160.

SO THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE PLAY FOR EVERY $200 INVESTED IS $160 *PROFIT* ON AVERAGE...

Now that's a damn good play...

End of DD.

---

*Edit:*

It has been brought to my attention that good DD should be more informative. So I will include some, again, simplistic data points to inform and back the probabilistic analysis above...

1. Late January FTDs were in the millions. Ryan Cohen and BlackRock buy a lot of stock. Short squeeze ensued.

2. Short squeeze was artificially halted, and immediately collapsed, therefore the full short squeeze was not squoze

3. Late February, FTD data was underwhelming yet we had a gamma squeeze all the same continuing to early March.

4. Lots of calls at 800. Short squeeze halted at 450. Top of 1000 is a serious possibility.

5. Early March the stock was agressively shorted. Shares available are at zero practically.

6. Retail is buying and holding. Price has stabilized at an unexpectedly high 190

7. Points 2 to 5 and 9 below strongly suggest there is significant remaining hidden short interest that has not been covered

8. We know HFs and whales have mechanisms and leverage to massively manipulate the market

9. A lot of data is hidden to us the average Joe's

10. Points above support a significant chance of a short squeeze eventually, yet point 8 tempers that by a lot...

Given the above information the intial probabilistic analysis in the OP is very reasonable","['TGT', 'BLK']"

**BLACKROCKAGEDDON**

Up too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled [Clean Energy ETF May See Big](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etf-may-see-030000958.html) Overhaul What it meant was so amazing I could not believe it:

>In the latest consultation, SPDJI is now planning to increase [their holdings] minimum to 100, more than tripling the current number of companies featured in the index. This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world’s largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    

You’re probably thinking “...oh...um...okay. Whatever?”  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn’t been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**

So, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*

[I found a document from SPDJI called a “consultation” that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. 

[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)

So, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&P Clean Energy Index**—the underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**

****

**Investment Firm Société Générale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings—what BlackRock’s gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)

>This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.

>This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand’s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.

>For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil’s Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.

Whoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**

**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. 

**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.

**What we’re pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.  NEE is a guaranteed add (BLNK not applicable thanks /u/sirajgb) We are also looking at **VST** as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. 

**What we’ll do**: Next week we’ll give some winners and losers.  I **will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report.**  For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. 

****

**ELI5**/**TLDR**: **BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks** due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul.  It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I’ll have more picks.

They are using MIAS Pharma to speed up the distribution process in the EU market

Plus they are in a study called PREPARE-IT, that looks at a possible COVID drug use. Info on that could be coming out in the next possible months.

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460651](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460651)

**Downsides.**

1. They have an ongoing case against generics in the US. But that only affects the US market, and only a fraction of the purpose of the drug which only affects less than 10% of sales in US market. They will have exclusivity for the rest of the world.
2. Big money is purposefully holding this down until what I believe will be a buyout later this year. Looking at options, in my opnion the buyout will be between $27-$35 by Jan22.

* Buy TGT when it was $170 it's now $200
* Buy $AAPL when it was $116 it's now $122

&#x200B;

**Up next is $ASO and so far it's shaping up to be a great trade.**

There are a couple of key items regarding $ASO to understand why it's primed for a big breakout.

1. They just reported earnings this week, and the results were stellar:
   1. Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
   2. (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.
2. It has high institutional ownership (I've seen conflicting numbers, if I am to go off of yahoo data it would appear that 60mm of the 90mm shares are institutionally owned. )
3. March 15, 2021 short interest was over 39% (It's almost certain that anyone who has shorted this is under water right now...unless they opened a short at 3:53pm today, which is not likely).

April 16, 2021 options:

* The $25, $30, $35 all have more open interest than any single strike in the put column.
* 18,973 for the $30 strike is massive volume for a stock that has 93% institutional ownership.
   * The public float is 31 million
   * Outstanding shares are 90 million
* The 18,000 contracts on the $30 strike representing nearly 2 million shares is pretty significant when considering the public float is only 31 million. If every strike closes ITM this will likely have somewhere in the 40,000 - 50,000 contracts closing ITM which is 4-5mm of that 31mm shares (7%)

$ASO closed the day just over $29 / share and has moved up a little in after hours, nearly 30. We have a long weekend so once Monday rolls around there will be a lot of pressure on MM's due to the fact that 18,000+ contracts would expire ITM at the $30 strike by that Friday.

mi359z,,wallstreetbets,post,1617305787,"BlackBerry earnings/call were actually bullish ✅ credit to u/Rivaaal

 I see **many** paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG BB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4. *(for reference $8.50 -8.7% 31st March 2021)*

Can we please dig a little bit deeper? Thank you.

*During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to* ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** *The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.*

**Boom** pure and simple explanation for why the revenue missed. It’s not on weaker demand. It’s only because they are about to sell their side business and consequently they had to significantly cut that stream of revenue. Which also means that negotiations are advanced.

**What will happen then they sell?** they will receive a big fat cheque (don’t quote me on this but I imagine north of $500m if not a billion+ ; pure speculation) + according to the CEO they will collect royalties for 7 years. And they get to focus on their core businesses: cybersecurity, EV software, internet of things.

Is this good strategy-wise? Absolutely. Focus on your top projects with higher gross margins. Let go of the past and embrace the future.

**any analyst reaction? Yes indeed Canaccord upgraded the stock to Hold** from Sell this morning.

**Canaccord sees 'building blocks coming together'**

*Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends”. The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.*

*Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.*

*The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""*

So even boomers traditionally late to the technology party are starting to see the whole BlackBerry’s strategy aligning. But these guys stay on the sideline because they don’t like early tendies. They lack the vision to say it’s an actual Buy especially at these levels. They will probably wait that a bigger broker moves first. And they will.

**a quick look at the numbers** BlackBerry has a $5bn market cap with $1bn+ yearly revenue and $800m in cash. I imagine investors can put 2 and 2 together. What do you think will happen to their balance sheet when they cash in the incoming sale of their portfolio. Way more cash to execute their plans and potential M&A if needed and no need for new shares issuance as confirmed by the CEO (no dilution in sight ; enough money in the bank). We could be in the coming weeks in a situation where BB has in cash the equivalent of 25%+ of their market cap...

**how about their core strategy?** *QNX now has design wins with 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs and remains on course to return to a normal revenue run rate by mid-fiscal 2022. BlackBerry IVY also made encouraging progress, with positive engagement from a number of leading automakers and the launch of our BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund.*

In just one quarter they added 4 more EV OEMs with QNX (from 19 to 23 now).

They are well positioned to be involved in autonomous driving: *BlackBerry expands its partnership with Baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology.* and *BlackBerry QNX Black Channel Communications to be used in Motional's driverless platform.* These are weeks-old news but it’s funny how it seems to go under the radar when it comes to price the company. Correct me if I’m wrong but Baidu could be the first and/or major player in autonomous driving in Asia.

QNX is still in SpaceX rockets. And I start to hear rumors that Tesla could consider using it too (very speculative but at least you’ve heard it).

And for the people who have ended up here randomly BlackBerry [IVY](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) is a joint venture with Amazon AWS for intelligent vehicle data platform. When the IVY deal was released BB shot past $9. AWS boss/founder at the time is now Amazon CEO.

So yea the revenue has missed by a few millions for an one-off reason. Have the fundamentals changed? Actually yes they have improved as they are well on track to pursue their strategic goals.

The question you should ask yourself is whether you are pricing BlackBerry based on their FY2020 or on what they are about to become?

I probably bought more June calls together with some shares (please don’t do like me).

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

**TLDR** why are you selling BB? if that’s because the revenue has slightly missed because they are selling a big chunk of their unneeded business for big money then you should ask yourself why you are in this ship in the first place. Even boomers analysts upgraded the stock this morning: they are starting to see BlackBerry business model happening.

CFTC is the **Commodity Futures Trading Commission** and ""... is an **independent agency of the US government** created in 1974, that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, which includes **futures, swaps, and certain kinds of options.""** [\[wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission)

Now I don't know about you, but to me, this seems as a huge conflict of interests. And as far as I was able to find, so does to their own [Code of Conduct and Supplemental Ethics Regulations](https://www.governmentattic.org/23docs/CFTCcodeOfConduct_2016.pdf).

 

[Excerpt from the Code of Conduct](https://preview.redd.it/1z26tyamnmq61.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90657364b15e86e48dc2a79516bf34b336d407d)

Which points directly to a [law about this](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/207),

&#x200B;

[18 U.S. Code § 207 - Restrictions on former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches](https://preview.redd.it/alxyqs5momq61.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=181871e38c8665facf73915eca9020f13c2cd7ff)

Since the point of CFTC is to oversee and regulate the very part of market that Citadel is also part of, I would imagine, that there could be instances when these two parties meet. And quick search showed, they do. For example in September, but that's just to prove a point. 

&#x200B;

[External meeting register of CFTC](https://preview.redd.it/7tkjzpnspmq61.png?width=1113&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8a04c21aedf618d793c664977fc0be5432f6aa2)

I truly am just an ape, but I would imagine, that matters of these meetings are advised by a group of lawyers prior to them (maybe even during in some instances). 

And since Tarbert is becoming the Chief of lawyers at Citadel Securities, they will all answer to him and he will lead them. That seems like a clear conflict of interest and, if I am getting it correctly, brakes the rule that prohibits this for 1-2 years after the termination and should be punishable.

Am I getting this right? Is it really enough for him to distance himself by only one level, so for example by not going to the meetings or to not directly communicate with any employee of his formal employer?

mi2oum,,wallstreetbets,post,1617304514,"$ASO and why you apes are gonna be mad you missed this oneAlright let’s get right into this. $ASO known as academy sports and outdoors is a large nationally run sports equipment n shit like that store. I’m poetic I know. Academy has 259 stores nationwide but wants to see that grow to over 800.

They just report earnings this week and absolutely SMASHED earnings. EPS projected .46, actual was 1.09. They also beat revenue projections from 1.56B to 1.6B not much but still improved. Their net sales was 5.69(nice)Billion a 18% increase over the prior year. In comparison Dicks sporting goods, which has substantially more stores only improved 9.5% yoy.

Considering the fact that all of last year basically every single sport was canceled and yet they still destroyed earnings has me happier than a kid on Christmas morning. Every single team sport that was shut down last year is back for business this year baby which means more money for $ASO 🤑🤑🤑. Oh they also sell a shit ton of guns and ammo, which is obviously a big deal in today’s political scenario.

Now you say, okay why’s that matter this stock has been trading for only a couple months. Well here’s where things get interesting.

This is a disclaimer, I do not care how high a company is shorted unless there is substantial evidence that would convince me that due to the high short interest and the proponents of a good run company that the price will increase. This is that scenario.

Short interest is at 39%, public float is 31M and market cap is 2B, 9.1 days to cover, read those numbers again, then wipe your ass cause you probably shit yourself.

Now I don’t want to taunt this as “ThE nExT gMe” cause it’s not. I am simply bringing attention to a company with almost 900 MILLION CASH ON HAND, and the fact that EVERY SINGLE MOTHERFUCKING SHORT is currently underwater. Yup you read that right, every single short that has been opened in this stock is currently underwater. Unless $ASO screws up big time these shorts will have no choice but to cover.

Edit: adding one of my comments to the post because squeeze not squoze:

**We'll see how many 'shares' are owned by 13F as of the 3/31 cutoff date on 5/15 when 13F must be filed. The shorts have 45 days and counting before all hell breaks loose.**

Why?

Because 'the shorts have closed.' So they say. However, as of 12/31/2020 (per Fintel), Insiders + 13F filers owned 97M of the 70M shares that exist in the world. So statically we can prove a minimum of 27M shares were shorted as of 12/31 without any concern for Finra disclosure 'mistakes'. At that time, it was widely accepted that there were about 100M shares shorted -- 140% of all the shares that exist (nevermind the float!).  So FINRA showed 4x the number of shorted shares than we can deduce from the 13F filings (as of 12/31)

For 3/31, if the 13F filers show that collectively still own about the same number of shares -- 97M or so o the the 70M shares that actually exist -- **shorts r fuk**.  Because it means they didn't cover a damn thing.

If anything, retail owns FAR more shares now (3/31) than they did 12/31 -- 3 weeks before GME caught main stream, world wide attention. We've seen HODLers from Europe, NZ, all over. The January RobinHood freeze was the rallying cry for the world.  **9% of US adults bought at least 1 share of GME during January.** They all bought. Many held. They didn't sell at $40, why would they have sold now at $190?

I'm putting **(my own personal)** clock on this. 45 days and counting. I like being right. Getting paid is just gravy.",

(as an aside, right now NFPs are 1st, even though I can see CPI inflation becoming the most watched in the next couple of months)

Those are the non-farm payrolls. Basically employment numbers, or how many of our fellow apes have finally hit 0.00 on the account and now gainfully employed and contributing to society through manning the Wendy's counter. The more wagecucks, the more spending. The more spending, the more companies have to hire wagecucks and so on. 

https://preview.redd.it/v8svd5o9soq61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1d0fb1341907cc26729ba79b968c4eb6a39698

I fully expect a blowout number, well above the 647k which is what we're playing with (expectations are set at 650k, so the higher it is, the more unexpectedly bearish for fixed income, and the lower it is below 650k, the more bids there will be for fixed income). 

Why? March takes into account the massive jump in vaccinations. This also plays into the fact that in March, around 20 states have increasingly lowered their age restrictions for vaccines. Every reasonable business owner sees this, and because there is a certain 1-2 week or so lag between interviews. Remember in March 2020 when everyone is trying to front-run the dips, June/July front-run the recovery, and now Citadel trying to front-run the RH GME Diamond Hand Apes? This is the same thing but now in the employment market. 

And this time, all the job gains are in the service industry, the same industry that vomited jobs as we entered the lockdowns. Do you need someone with skills to flip burgers? No. This is all low-hanging (easy to train, no need for previous experience) fruit that's about to get harvested not by hand, but with an industrial thresher that will make your mom blush. Companies are able to hire truckloads of these $7.25/hr minwagecucks because they're cheap, and this time they're needed. In every economic cycle, low-wage service sector jobs are the first to get dumped off the cliff, and first to get shoveled back in. We're just seeing the start of this.

**What does this mean for:**

**Equities**: all these boomer/doomers need to STFU and go suck Cramer's ass hair. A rising yield is good for equities because if a treasury is pulling in 2%/yr RISKFREE, equities need to go higher. Why did tech do a 10% correction during the last 10yr jump from 1.5% to 1.75%? Because no one expected it to go that high. Now my fellow retards at the office and I are expecting 2% to hit as early as June, and so is every other person I'm talking to (mostly my mom). 2% is as good as priced in right now, and because everyone is expecting it, I do not expect an equities tantrum... unless we somehow cross that line and go straight into 2.5%

**Bonds**: this has what I've been mostly doing, apart from some ag and metals. Simple as that - yields go up, bond prices go down. No need to worry about blah blah how this will translate into growth. From basically the realization that the US is going to lead the way with vaccinations, this thing has been going straight down.

&#x200B;

Why tomorrow? Equity markets are closed. The treasuries market will be open, but extremely light in volume. Any blowout number, coupled with no one to trade may lead to a vaccum, amplifying single direction moves. Perhaps we might even get a [rare circuit breaker](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/price-limits.html#interestRates) in the treasuries futures markets. 

Good luck all. Positions below. A lot of 129 Puts for June, which I don't expect to go ITM.

Also you guys buying TLT puts are kinda throwing money away. IV for Puts of the May chain are like 15%. Similar IV for Puts of the June chain (also 50 days to exp) on /ZN (10yr treasury futures) is around 5%. I know it's 20yr vs 10yr but srsly the duration should not mean you're paying 3x as much for volatility. Larry Fink or whoever is writing these is laughing to the bank.

Source: [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/)

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

Based on $4,000 PT, it comes down to an average of $2.43 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. An average gain of 0.13% per day would result in the same end result. Neither of these scenario are likely to happen as it is impossible for stock price to move consistently in one direction whether it is dollar gain or percentage gain. This is how it would look like for the both scenarios (broken down in six month intervals).

|Date|Projected Price (Fixed $ gain)|Projected Price (Fixed % gain)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|July 1, 2021|$883.33|$745.69|
|January 1, 2022|$1,331.35|$949.34|
|July 1, 2022|$1,772.07|$1,203.87|
|January 1, 2023|$2,220.09|$1,532.66|
|July 1, 2023|$2,660.80|$1,943.58|
|January 1, 2024|$3,108.83|$2,474.39|
|July 1, 2024|$3,551.98|$3,141.91|
|January 1, 2025|$4,000.00|$4,000.00|

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

My positions

* 41 shares.
* 2x $700c 4/9e.

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

**Current Business Situation**

* Last year, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO made $9.04 Billion in revenue.
* They spend more than $-14 Billion with a loss of $-3.0 Billion.
* Investors lost $-5.4 per share.

**Future Projections**

* If they stop growing, the company will be worth $14.8 per share.
* Based on Wall Street forecasts, the company will grow at 18.1% a year for the next 5 years. That means SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO will be worth $50.4, which represents a **-17.5%** downside from the current price.

mi07tr,,wallstreetbets,post,1617297740,"(DD) ASO options ladder is enticing, high short interest + good earningsThis data is based off of ShortSight, paid real time short data from S3 partners.

As we can see, in the last few weeks, short interest in ASO spiked to \~44%.

https://preview.redd.it/t98kwbfwflq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c15011205d06acd072aa2d039288dad69dd71d4

ASO killing earnings on 3/30:

* All time high net income, 157% increase y/y
* 311% increases y/y on adjusted net income
* .97 EPS, for a 304% increase y/y

I see this as a reopening play + potential for a gamma squeeze.

**Gamma squeeze + pressure on shorts to close**

As we've seen w/ stocks like GME, options provide more leverage than holding shares for moving a stock's price. If there are a chain of strike prices w/ high open interest and we manage to get close to the first link in that chain (in this case, $25 was the first link, while at the time of writing it is now $28.34), it can cause a reaction where MM need to delta hedge these options by buying shares (as they want to stay delta neutral and just make money off premiums), which increase the stock's price, which lets us hit the next link in the chain, etc. etc.

Forbes has a good article that explains this concept when applied to GME: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/).

As we can see, open interest is also high on options (ex: 19000 calls on 4/16 for $30).

https://preview.redd.it/2ph9enq8hlq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7105dc532cce8fc36164931e890c51656b9c65

If the stock can near/hit $30, it will squeeze upwards due to the delta hedging by MMs. This will be exacerbated by the high short interest of 43%, all borrowed when the stock was at a lower price (\~$23), shorts will feel high pressure to cover in order to minimize losses if this stock trends upwards.

**Reopening play**

Dicks Sporting Goods no longer sells guns in Texas. As people go out more / reignite their hobbies, ASO will receive more business as now it is in position to be a primary seller of guns. Even as a long term hold (instead of playing the options chain) this seems like a good play.

**The play**

I think there's potential for a gamma ladder squeeze on the call options priced for 4/16. The open interest is there, the catalyst is there (run up in stock price due to amazing earnings), and there's the additional high short interest which means if things moon, they'll moon even harder. The options right now are reasonably priced for this date as well.

**The bear case**

The earnings report isn't enough to drive this stock near 30$ by 4/16. Another catalyst doesn't come, or the market in general corrects (as we are at ATH). In this case, the call option ladder will fail to materialize.

mia4ul,,wallstreetbets,post,1617327556,"DD: Boomer Edition round 2 - Construction 🚧🏗️ Stock - 🦅 Eagle Materials EXPLooking for an undervalued company filled with hard workers and actual physical products?  Tired of stocks focused digital things and imaginary future technology that might exist someday?!  Well my second 🥈 round of boomer deep dives is for you.  Last time we talked about 🚂 this time 🧰🔨👷🚧

So out in Dallas Texas there is great Dividend giving company called Eagle Materials 🦅🇺🇲

Let's look at their profile compared to competitors in the construction materials field.

Eagles Materials
Revenue: $1.2 billion
Revenue growth: 15%
Profit Margins: 20%
Employees: 2200
PE 16.37

Martin Marietta Materials 
Revenue: $4 billion
Revenue growth: 3%
Profit Margins: 12%
Employees:  8800
PE: 28.92

Summit Materials
Revenue: 2.33 Billion
Revenue Growth: 5%
Profit Margins: 6%
Employees: 6,000
PE: 23.28

Looks like they have far lower price to earnings with better growth and better profits.  They also get a bit more out per employee.  

Effecient and growing 🪴.  This is what we want in companies!

Now for one of the key points on why this is a 2x buy check their financial filings: http://ir.eaglematerials.com/investor-relations

In their annual report they reiterate the intention of the company to separate their heavy and light materials divisions into entirely independent publically traded stocks.    Why are they doing this?  Because the board and CEO know their stocks are undervalued and a major shareholders they are tired of it.  Splitting the company means you get two stocks with an undervalued PE ratio in more concise markets.  Easier to prove value and easier to get investor intention with a big move.  Those two stocks aren't staying down and even if they evaluate close to properly compared to their competition you are already close to a 2x deal!

But that's not all.  It isn't just that Eagle is in a good position now, the market puts them in a good position long term to succeed.

1. Materials🧱 are scarce🔎 across the board right now.  Everyone is behind on deliverys due to COVID related disruptions and the economy reving up too fast.  There is no fast solution to the backlog which means guaranteed revenue stream for over a year AND efficient companies benefit the most by having room to gain market share.  On top of that material suppliers are getting the opportunity to line their pockets with a bit of extra revenue since there really isn't competition for customers in this market.  Many companies aren't even taking on new customers right now because they are already stuck managing allocations for their existing base.

2. Commercial Real Estate is going down hard.  🗄️🖇️📉Office space in major cities is coming to an end and nothing can stop it.  Companies now know they need less office space and less people in the office so they aren't going to fork out anywhere near as much leasing space in expensive locations like NYC, LA, Chicago, etc.   The restructuring🏗️ needed to account for this will require materials and materials you need for these conversions are the exact types of Products Eagle offers🧱.  Clear case of forward looking demand.

Boomer Points:

1. While it is true that millennials probably couldn't hang dry wall if their lives depended on it 😴Joe is going let 🇲🇽🌮 back in and they can definitely help with all the labor shortages in the construction industry.  We may soon be back to the days where you can pay they nice gentlemen outside home depot to come help you finish a project no questions asked.  Don't have to worry about shithead contractors not showing up for quote.  

2. 🦅 is a legimate company that offers their employees pensions, stock options, and solid wages.  People who work there want to work there.  It isn't like my job at Wendy's.  This is a company where talent stays.

3. Dividends 🤩!!!! You can grow your shares more by having shares!

Cons: 

1. Commercial Real Estate crash might bring down everything in the real estate and construction market for a while.  Depends on how much bag holding the commercial landlords insist on doing.  If they don't recalibrate quickly or decide to beg for bailouts we might see a mini recession in that market with lots of empty spaces and no activity to refresh or maintain.  

2. Lots of upside for construction materials is priced in and Eagle has already beat market growth for the year.  However PE still says they don't meet the competition so this probably not substantial.

Warning: This Dick Dipping was performed by my permanently flaccid dicklet that contributed to my eventual divorce and shouldn't be counted as sound financial advice or a means of contributing pleasure to anyone's life.
