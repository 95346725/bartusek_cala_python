I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

&#x200B;

  

[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Google) shifted more than $75.4 billion (€63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial “double-Irish” tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Bermuda) at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=United+States) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of €23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed – unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The “double Irish” was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the “standard rate tax is 0 per cent”.

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: “In December 2019, in line with the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

“Including all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,” she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company’s subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company’s main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded €45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to €1.94 billion. It paid €263 million in tax that year, down nearly €9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Donald+Trump) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States.","['IP', 'GOOGL']"

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
> From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson & Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
> So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
> That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
> # Signs of margin pressures?
> Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
> Utilities was the best performing major S&P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
> Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
> “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
> “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
> While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
> Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
> “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
> But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
> # Searching for hints of inflation
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
> “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
> He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
> The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
> Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
> Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
> “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
> # Economic rebound
> In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
> There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.

> “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
> However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
> He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
> “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
> # Watching bonds
> Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
> Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
> “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
> “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

> # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

> “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

> The bull market continues, with the S&P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

> Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

> First, the S&P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&P 500 was up >10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Third, the S&P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

> Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

> After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

> The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

> Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

> # Growth a Market Cap Story

> Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

> That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

> In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

> With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

> # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

> Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

> In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

msom5l,,stocks,post,1618656842,"Can someone explain why dividend investing is good?How does dividend investing make sense? 

For example, Apple pays a yearly dividend of $2.65 per share and each share is worth around $140 a share.

Assuming you buy 1,000 shares = $140,000 

You’re yearly dividend will only be = $2,650 ( $2.65 x 1,000)

The return on investment seems extremely low for such a huge investment, obviously this doesn’t take into consideration if Apple stock goes up, but this is irrelevant since as dividend investors you’re not looking to sell the shares anyway.

Why wouldn’t someone choose to invest the $140,000 into properties for rent that generates the same amount in a matter of months?",['AAPL']
msom5l,guu87n8,stocks,comment,1618661388,"Basically dividends have a compounding effect that magnify your returns over time as long as the company keeps paying them and you reinvest them. Dividends in healthy companies also tend to increase over time. I invested in a utility company years back and it yielded 4% of what I initially invested, now it’s between 8% and 9% of what I invested plus the stock price tripled. It’s excellent when interest rates are low.

Companies like Apple, MA, V, MSFT have low yields as examples. But they’re growing, have safe dividends, and have the runway to increase them.","['AAPL', 'MSFT']"

It's been a real struggle ever since, and seeing every day how other people make lots of money while I'm sitting on my (mostly) losses makes me feel like an incredible failure. 

*Just for the record: I don't own PLUG, ENPH etc., I'm being dragged down by stuff like DOCU and SPOT, and some European stocks which go down for seemingly no reason at all. Re-balancing didn't seem like a good option because I didn't want to sell e.g. SPOT at a loss to chase a gain which may never come.* 

I tried to just stay away from the news, but then I don't learn anything. And then everybody suddenly starts asking me why I didn't just buy dog$shit coin. Or even worse, people tell me about their 2020 gains and how loosing 20% is, like, nothing because they're still up 150%. 

How do you deal with all of this? It's not even loosing money as such that bothers me, it's the feeling of being a complete failure. Is this something that goes away over time? Did you find methods to retain some inner peace and confidence, or did you have that kind of personality to begin with?

msozip,guunech,stocks,comment,1618668342,"Not everyone is cut our for individual stock picking. And that's ok. This is why passive ETFs exist and thrive. Most people end up not beating a broad market index long term because at the core, emotions get in the way. The emotions you describe are what you said are getting you down, more than the loss of money. The psychological aspect of trading is something few mention but is at the core of most trades. 

While you are learning about stocks and doing research, put the majority of your money or future money in a broad market index. Something like VTI or VT if you want to include the whole world . 80% of your money goes in these, and every month contribute some more to it. The other 20% of your money can be for your more speculative plays. These speculative stocks though go up or down. Tuning out other people's chatter is something you'll have to do no matter what in life. There's always someone bragging about a new car, new job, new house, etc in real life and the echo chamber of subreddits is no different. Gain porn and loss porn is a thing and some people just love watching it but at the core, they are bets and gambles. Things based on feelings or because someone else did it, or because they think it's a part of an overall movement. Whatever it is, it's not logical and that's why they are speculative. If ppl are asking why you didn't invest in dogcoin, shrug your shoulders and say you didn't want to. If they tell you how much they gained and how you missed out, nod and say good for you. 

There's always gonna be another bus. Always. You may not have got on the GME bus or the dogcoin bus or the next yolo bus....but there's gonna be more busses. There will be more opportunities. Something people forget is that DFV actually did years long research and didn't just yolo because of nothing. He had conviction and had studied this stock in and out and was mocked incessantly in wsb by the same ppl what now worship him as their lord and saviour.

I only invest in growth stocks which I have the opportunity to double my money within the next five years. I'm long term focused.

THREE STOCKS I AM BUYING RIGHT NOW

Corsair Gaming (CRSR)
-Corsair is currently trading at a forward PE ratio of under 20. Both top line and bottom line numbers have steadily increased and the gaming industry is growing. It has a dominant market share in the gaming and streaming business. This is one I am currently buying under $35 and the lower it goes, the more I am bullish.

Tattooed Chef (TTCF)
-Tattooed Chef is a smaller company which still has alot more room to grow. Many new deals have been announced. Examples include Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. Revenue is growing rapidly and profitability is beginning to rise. As the company announces new deals and new products, brand loyalty will begin to form and the long term success of the company could be massive with the company only being about ~1.5B.

Beyond Meat (BYND)
-Beyond Meat is rather expensive compared to its peers but at $130 and under, I find it very interesting. I love the CEO and the speed at which the company moves. Like TTCF, profitability is beginning to arise and the top line growth for BYND is MASSIVE! The company is currently focused on growing U.S. market share and global expansion. It may be expensive now but I think will be a BIG WINNER over the next decade.

For me, there are so many stocks I love and I think would be great investments. But, they are almost always very expensive. PE and PS ratios for pretty much any stock with a bright future are incredibly high.

But I'm wondering if some would also buy certain stocks as a larger holding as a defensive measure against downside loss on a certain percentage of your portfolio versus cash/bonds.

For example I can think of JNJ of course.  It's largest drawdown was around -34% if I remember correctly and it's worst year was -10%.  It's averaged a 14% return since the 80s.

So I could see it or even MSFT etc as 'protecting' a certain percentage of my portfolio in the long term whilst also offering better than a 10% return hopefully.

I don't see JNJ or MSFT crashing and never recovering, but of course one can never say never.

ms4niw,,stocks,post,1618584286,"The New Normal - 25% of the S&P 100 companies are >70 RSI signaling ""overbought""I typically watch the top 100 companies daily. I find it entertaining more than anything. I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.

The RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.

If you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.

We see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.

I continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!

EDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.

Was running errands and in traffic and got home 5 minutes after market close. Now my account only 6k in it. A cash account. I called TDA with intentions of telling to do a do not exercise ( DNE). The recording informed me if I did not have funds to purchase the shares that TDA would close out the option contract for me. 

 Fast forwarded to today and I am now short -1500 shares and they put 15k dollars in my account. Once again I am on a cash account not a margin account. My question is can they margin call a cash account?

Once you’ve built that up some, you could start adding individual stocks or if you believe that a certain sector or industry is going to outperform you could use a sector specific ETF.

I see everyone praising LEAPS for long term profits over buying the underlying with leverage.

Maybe I'm missing somethint but from some quick math in this example, buying the underlying with margin is much more profitable. 

Current AMD price: $82

Dec 17 2020 82 strike premium for 1 call: $1220

If underlying goes to $110 the profit is roughly $1900 


Now if I were to invest this premium with x5 leverage:

$1220 * 5 = $6100

$6100 / 82 (current price) = 74 shares

Lets say the underlying goes to $110 like above.

74 shares * 110 = $8100

$8100 - 1220 = $6880 profit

msbrms,,stocks,post,1618604922,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 16, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 16, 2021**

Stocks traded higher on Friday, continuing momentum from yesterday’s record-setting close, with a batch of better-than-expected economic and corporate earnings results fueling the recent rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. 

According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

Due to the deadline push back for tax filing the contribution this year has been pushed back to May 17th, I think. So you could contribute $6k to IRA 2020 (by May 17th) and a separate $6k to IRA 2021 to jump start your tax free investments.

If you have a 401k (401k Roth) option at your company I would also invest in that, even if you are only limited in certain investments. I think they allow you max of $19.5k this year. After you leave a firm you can convert that entire amount into an IRA Roth. My biggest regret was not understanding this. I had a 401k that sat for 15 years after leaving the firm without converting to IRA Roth. Kicking myself missing out on being able to invest in stocks tax free. I just converted last year after the meltdown and despite having to pay the highest tax bracket for the conversion, I've already made it back through investment gains and now all future earnings will be tax free. That's 20+ more years.

At your age I would probably hold ETFs and 1 or 2 growth stocks. In 20 years you'll have a big pot to allocate risk dabbling in options...a tax free account means no worries about wash rules, freedom to buy/sell without concern for taxes...

Good luck!",

Between the end of trading sessions on Friday April 16th 2021, and before the start of trading on Monday 19th April 2021, it is expected that Blackrock will rebalance their positions in ICLN/INRG in accordance to changes to thee S&P Global Clean Energy index to which they track.

This is starting to take place in New Zealand as trading hours are extended by 45 minutes to accommodate high volumes in both Meridian Energy and Contact Energy (both of which are seeing their weightings reduced). 

[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-extends-trading-hours-for-sp-global-index-change/2N4Q2ENY7W6TALMMRJBLWZ4XRM/](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-extends-trading-hours-for-sp-global-index-change/2N4Q2ENY7W6TALMMRJBLWZ4XRM/)

It is also expected that Plug Power, which drove much of the ETFs growth in 2020 (and demise in 2021 following a market correction and accounting errors), will see it's weighting gradually reduced. This will be of relief to many investors who are looking to bet on clean energy, but have been concerned by Plug's overweighting at \~10% of the index.

The restructuring will see the holdings of ICLN/INRG increase from \~30 to \~100, increasing it's diversity and it's stability. 

The rebalancing is likely to act as a watershed moment for the ETF which has been trading sideways since it bottomed out in March 2nd 2021 and is looking for a breakout opportunity. This morning INRG opened on the London Stock Exchange with a 2% gain in the first 90 minutes of trading.

The U.S. has just thrown a ton of supply and strong economic data at the bond market and it's had no impact. First it was the U.S. jobs report, then $120 billion of Treasury auctions, followed by consumer price inflation, and now retail sales. The 10-year yield slid to a one-month low.

We are in Terminator 2 territory now, where the rewired-good-guy-Arnold Schwarzenegger's bullets make silvery craters in the natty-but-somewhat-intense robot policeman... But the holes close up, and he's after them again with that odd choppy-handed sprint.

&#x200B;

The market if looked at from a simple graph looks absurd in comparison to previous years, 20% growth even after a crash! however, if compared to previous years this is not 'super uncommon' and still possible like 2013 for example. From this point on when I say the markets I am really just referring to the SPY, since its a simple and accurate portrayal of the overall market imo.

sure, there are some stocks that obviously may crash, and are most certainly going to be argued about if they will crash or not, for example AMC, GME, etc. however, the overall market could not be healthier at the moment, we are currently coming out of a pandemic, and the largest companies are gaining more and more business as the smaller mom-and-pop shops are being forced to close due to a lack of business, while companies like AMZN and WMT have become evermore profitable in 2020 (while this may not be good overall, looking at it from a strictly stock market performance stance, its great news) due to this separation, and allowing big companies to do better, it makes sense the market is growing at such a rate (though maybe the 7-8% in march/April may call for a slight correction). 

companies like CCL, DAL, AAL, and other covid recovery stocks are also improving as their prospects look better going forward, and consumer spending is going to increase as we leave this pandemic behind us. interest rates are extremely low, allowing companies to further increase their profits, and grow as companies, in not creating crazy overvalued companies (there are obvious exceptions)

I see many people worried about inflation, and showing various graphs that have flaws, such as the M1 graph I believe I saw on the home page here, or maybe on a similar subreddit, hinting that there is far too much money in circulation right now, but that graph has only gone up so much because of the shift from M1 not including savings accounts to now including them.

Furthermore, comparing it to the 2000 bubble is not even fair, the 2000 bubble had seen at least 230% growth in the 5 years leading up, we have only seen around 100%. during the 2000 bubble, nobody thought the market would crash, and continue the increase, during this current market however, things couldn't be more different, everyone is trying to guess what will cause the market crash, you see it all over the news, on CNBC, barrons, and then in all the investing subreddits, trying to predict the next market crash. there are no crappy loans like in 2008, and again, like in 2008 nobody really assumed a crash, and everyone assumed house prices would just increase, however that couldn't be more different today, (with the stock market I mean). 

I believe this has just been an exceptionally good year, and may continue until 2022 or 2023 even, or may slow down soon, and just consolidate, but personally, I don't see a large drop like everyone is suggesting. If you disagree, that's up to you, but for the love of god, please stop putting graphs that don't prove anything about a crash coming, I've seen 3 different graphs posted make trending, trying to indicate a crash is coming, which I believe are unrelated, or are exaggerated.","['CCL', 'AAL', 'WMT', 'AMZN', 'DAL']"

I find it extremely odd there are hardly any mentions of one of the literal biggest and oldest players in this field - Siemens Energy.

It's like Reddit has a grudge against older established companies, and expects some new techy company to overtake them overnight. I really do not find this to be the case in this industry. For instance, a company like Siemens Energy has almost one hundred billion in backlog. Meaning, they have secure revenue streams for decades to come thanks to their long term service programs for their technologies. So again, I don't see them vanishing seemingly overnight because some young stud from california invents something they haven't. There's a good chance they might just buy it.

The company just spun off into the only ""pure play"" energy company in the world, traded publicly. Unlike their primary competition, GE, they are not in financially troubling times, and have plenty of cash to do what they are aiming to do - reimagine themselves as a pure green energy company. They are the only company offering **today** conversions of gas fired plants to hydrogen fire (eliminating emissions), offer one of the biggest batteries in the world (through Fluence technology), have the largest installed fleet of wind turbines worldwide (Siemens Gamesa), and are on the leading technical edge for smart building, infrastructure, and grid stabilization projects.

And yet...their stock price does hardly anything. Definitely did not benefit from the pump and dump nature other tech stocks have seen in the last 12 months. I just want to understand why?

ms7uxv,,stocks,post,1618593378,"RECAF - Reconnaissance Energy Africa Full DD coming Sunday. But a weekend of hype could build and gap up on Monday.RECAF Reconnaissance Energy Africa. 

Full disclosure, Been buying since $2.75 but I bought more 5000 more shares today at $5.75. So I still feel really good about the PPS. Could be a truly amazing run this year!! 

Taken from article links below...

“The size of the potential upside for Recon Africa, combined with the speed the company is executing its exploration program, means that this is not likely a scenario where investors are forced to wait for a potential payoff five years or more into the future. Positive drilling results could trigger an increase in share value – or potential partnership and acquisition news – at some point in 2021, probably making this a rare short-term opportunity with significant upside potential.”


Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO.V; RECAF) is a small $300 million company that has secured petroleum licenses for an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana...two extremely resource-friendly countries with very low royalties fees.

This basin – as deep as the Permian – could prove to be one of the world's last-ever giant onshore oil discoveries.   And as a new basin, the potential is likely for Conventional Oil and Gas.  No Fracking, normal production profiles, low water requirements which means low cost per barrel. And Recon Africa has secured the petroleum licensing rights to the entire basin.

With one of the world's largest onshore, undeveloped hydrocarbon basins – whose potential has been analyzed and acknowledged by some of the industry's most sought-after experts – the oil that is hoped to be discovered by Recon Africa could ultimately prove to be worth tens of billions.

With drilling now underway, it's unlikely that this company remains under-the-radar for much longer – and the world will be very interested to learn about any major discovery made here.

The Most Exciting New Oil Frontier

Recon Africa (RECO.V; RECAF) owns the rights to a massive sedimentary basin loaded with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas. Under several long-term petroleum licenses, they have acquired all rights to an entire sedimentary basin in Namibia and Botswana.

The Kavango Basin is comprised of 8.75 million acres and is said to be similar in depth to the Permian. New data on the basin shows that not only is it large – it's also as much as 30,000 feet deep.  The Kavango is a rift-basin, which refers to geologically how the basin formed.  All of the major onshore oil and gas fields in sub-Saharan Africa are contained in rift basins.

The source rocks in the Kavango are believed to be the same age and quality South Africa's 600,000-square-kilometer Karoo sedimentary basin, home to Shell's massive Whitehill Permian gas play. The difference is that the thermal history in South Africa led to much higher heat flow and subsequent over-cooking that lead to only dry gas remaining. This year, armed with new data, noted source rock expert Dan Jarvie has estimated that the basin could be capable of generating 100 billion-plus barrels of oil. 

In November 2020, the highly respected global energy consultants at Wood Mackenzie issued a report proclaiming that the Kavango Basin ""represents one of the largest onshore undeveloped hydrocarbon basins in the world.""

In this report, the experts at Wood Mackenzie identified three basins that provide a useful benchmark as to what the potential for the Kavango Basin might look like...one of which was the US – Midland Basin (Permian) in Texas that has an estimated overall development value of $540 billion.

Experts Are Backing This New Oil Boom

Bill Cathey, President and Chief Geoscientist of Earthfield Technology is known as the ""geological interpreter to the supergiants,"" as he has consulted for every oil and gas major and large independent in the business. Here's what he had to say about the Kavango Basin:

""Not only was the data on the basin some of the best he had ever seen... nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin of this depth that has ever failed to produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. ""

And Cathey is not the only expert to have weighed in on the potential for Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECO.V; RECAF).

ms5tbv,,stocks,post,1618587644,"MGNI reporting Q1 earnings May 10MGNI was a stock I got into into right before Thanksgiving after doing some research on good growth stocks for the first half of 2021. They are a sell-side advertising provider.

Supply/Sell Side Platforms connect advertisers to publishers to ensure advertising inventory is properly filled within the publishers available channels. This is normally used by publishers to gain access to advertisers. This is where MGNI operates.

This compares to Demand Side Platforms that are  is used by advertisers to find publishers.

The goal of these platforms is to ensure that advertising inventory is properly targeted towards the consumers who are viewing publisher channels.

An example of sell side would be an in-house advertising company like Apple who would use MGNI to find proper publishers to target their iPhone ads. An example of demand side would be Roku using TTD to fill commercials between free streamed videos. Before advertising platforms, advertisers and publishers would do direct sales, but this lead to inefficiencies in targeted audiences and scalability.

As stated, MGNI operates on the sell side. They primarily target advertisers and work to find the proper publishers for which the advertiser's ads will find a home. As on their website, one of their clients is Discovery Communications which uses MGNI to properly target ads for their product portfolio.

MGNI makes money by offering proper placement of ads and also tracking of their efficiency. From their 10k filing:
> We provide a full suite of tools for sellers to control their advertising business and protect the consumer viewing experience. These controls are particularly important to CTV sellers who need to ensure a TV-like viewing and advertising experience for consumers.
> Buyers leverage our platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audiences on brand-safe premium inventory, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from thousands of sellers. We believe that our scale, platform features, and omni-channel offering makes us an essential partner for buyers.

MGNI has seen a 150% gain in stock price since November based on positive momentum in their connected TV offering. 2020 was the first year they saw solid CTV growth and its a new revenue stream for them. This has allowed their revenue to increase by almost 50% between 2019 and 2020. CTV makes up 15% of all their revenue, Desktop makes 36% and Mobile makes 49%. All three segments are growing, with CTV being the top growth line. Their revenue in 2020 was $221M.

I believe the stock has rallied based on expected CTV revenue growth in the future. At a stock price of $40, MGNI has a market cap of $4.5Bn. This puts its P/S ratio at about 20. Not too egregious but definitely high. If they can maintain 50% revenue growth YoY, that P/S ratio falls to a much more paltry 13.

Their margins are  currently 66%, which is consistent YoY. The main reason they didn't post a profit in 2020 was due to increased sales/marketing cost, higher administrative cost and what seems to be a one time restructuring cost.

In their Q1 earnings, here's what you should be looking for:

- How close is the stock to $40? $40 seems to be a good place for MGNI leading into May 10. If its above $40, I would trim my position to manage risk. If its below $40, I would increase my position based on risk tolerance. I pick $40 because that sets a P/S ratio of 20, and is the midpoint and support level since the February annual report.

- With the shutdown of 3rd party cookie tracking by browser and endpoints, sell-side advertising tracking has become more critical to have effectively targeted ads. Magnite has been putting out good PR trying to focus on this macro trend.

- Growth of the CTV business. We should see CTV moving towards almost 30% of total revenue.


If we don't see revenues of approximately $80M, with CTV business making up $20M of that revenue, I think that MGNI will see a sell off.


Right now, MGNI is seeing overall downward pressure that's affecting all small/mid cap companies. Its hard to remain convicted when its eating 3% losses every day. If MGNI doesn't find support at $35, its falling all the way to $18 where it found support after the December short attack by Spruce Point Capital.

If earnings show another 50% QoQ or YoY growth rate in revenue, buoyed by strong CTV and 3rd party cookie demand, I could imagine MGNI going to $50 to maintain a P/S ratio of 20. Anything short of that, I see MGNI falling to $20 until next earnings.",['AAPL']

ms1wno,,stocks,post,1618575380,"To those who say low interest rates justify higher valuations...To those who say low interest rates justify higher valuations...

... you must also acknowledge that higher current valuations imply lower future returns. Assuming no change in expected future cash flows, which is implied by only citing lower rates as justification for current valuations, you are essentially “pulling forward” returns with a higher PV of cash flows (low discount rate). Equity returns boil down to the discount rate being applied to cash flows over time and the delta between expected cash flows and actual cash flows. Therefore, if cash flows are delivered as expected, equity returns will equate to the discount rate that was applied to those cash flows. Of course, if you have a view that future cash flows will outperform expectations, then there is an opportunity to earn above the implied discount rate.

Now, I am not making a case for the market being over/undervalued. I have just heard too many market “experts” use the low interest rate argument for why it’s a good time to be in equities without acknowledging the other side of the coin.",

They’re also saying that the expectation is for the risk-free rate to *remain* low for a lengthy period of time, meaning the relative valuation of equities will remain higher than alternatives for years to come. 

You make a good point about pulling forward cash flows. A lot of people seem to think that an over-valued market has to end in some kind of burst. That does not have to be the case at all. It could very easily just lead to a period of lower-than-average gains as company earnings grow into the valuations. 

As long as the Fed keeps the risk-free rate low, and signals that they intend to keep it that way for some time, equities are going to command a higher valuation. It will unwind at some point (either quickly or slowly), but not until the rate situation changes.",

MAXN just priced their offering at $18 a share. That's 6.9M new shares, on a float of 13M and total of 30M. Thats a 23% dilution.

Also, that price point is some real management bullshittery, when MAXN was trading at $33 on April1 after the Biden infrastructure speech, and hit a peak of $52. Its as if the management always knew that MAXN was over valued, and priced the offering in line with their original split from SPWR price.

The revenue of MAXN in 2020 was 844M with a net loss of 144M.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MAXN

Their revenue was down from 2019, but their net loss was lower too, mainly due to lower operating loss.

Their cash position is higher than in 2019, but with declining revenues this isn't really a compelling point.

I think there is also an intangible here. Even though the underlying numbers may look okay, the behaviour of the leadership sets a tone for the future of the company.

Lets start first with the slide. MAXN is an offshoot of SPWR. SPWR announced their earnings in February and they were not great. This caused SPWR, MAXN and ENPH to all slide because all three companies are tied together at the hip.

Since that slide, MAXN has done absolutely nothing to set investor expectations for the upcoming earnings. The stock slid from $52 at its peak down to $19 today when the offering was officially priced.

In that 6 week span, I'm certain that the leadership had known the underlying challenges to the company and its fair market value. Of course all is fair in business, but this behaviour does not give me confidence holding MAXN going forward as the leadership cannot be trusted to take care of their shareholders.

There was also a great post about this yesterday:
https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mrog5u/opinion_on_maxn/guno907/


At this point, I don't believe MAXN will recover from its price point. I actually see MAXN sliding back to $12 before coming back up. It may get back up to $22, but I don't see it return to its $30+ glory days without some major turn around. Their primary installation partner (SPWR) is seeing reduced outlook and revenue on installations. Analysts are downgrading their models for SPWR, and MAXN has just put up numbers to reinforce their bad position.

If you're looking for a solar infrastructure and manufacturing play, I think SEDG is a better bet at this point that is more predictable, reliable and seems to have better management at the helm.

What does everyone think about my reasoning?

Full disclosure: I am a MAXN bag holder with cost average of $32. I should have sold on April 1 after the Biden speech, but I got too exuberant and didn't set good stop losses.",['ENPH']

Solar is the cheapest energy source to install now. Big companies are going for carbon neutral and some are focusing on making their own energy, not just getting green energy credit. MAXN gives the best solar panels as technology. Also they are not a Chinese company which I se it as a big advantage in an green infrastructure world.

I think the solar industry will keep going up just because it's cheaper than everything else and you can install solar panels over other structures (compared to wind). And I see MAXN as a possible big player.",

The 1st chart (daily) is a candlestick chart of the S&P 500. The time period shown is between June 1987 - October 1987. The chart consists of 3 up waves (green arrows) + 3 corrective waves (red arrows) before the final double top is put in place (bolded orange box). Once the double top was in place, the S&P 500 proceeded to experience downward price movement until falling 20% on October 19th, 1987.

The 2nd chart (daily) is a candlestick chart of the S&P 500. The time period shown is from November 2020 to April 16th, 2021. Subnani Investment Research, LLC believes the S&P 500 price action is making a similar double top pattern as in mid-August 1987. The firm believes the current pattern emerging consists of 3 similar up waves (green arrows) + 3 corrective waves (red arrows). The firm believes the S&P 500 is in the final process of forming a double-top bearish chart pattern that would lead to downward move in price and potentially a repeat of a double-digit %down day similar to October 19th, 1987.

The 3rd and 4th charts are from the time periods of April 16th, 2021 and October 1987. These charts are zoomed out to display the entire price action of the S&P 500 (candlesticks) and 10-year interest rate (blue line).

Then again i guess there is no time like the present hence why i’ve started this past week, stocks i’ve been investing in so far are Microsoft, Tesla, Nike, AMD, Disney and LG, mainly thinking of long term. 
I know this is heavily tech based and I’m looking to diversify my portfolio over the coming weeks.
Do you expect the same growth in the market this year? 

What sectors would you say will have the most growth?

I’ve been looking at the airline/hotel and commercial retail industries thinking these will surely grow as lockdown restrictions ease around the world and people spend money in shops, going on holidays etc.

Any thoughts on how to capitalise on the situation were in atm?

Like i said I’m a newcomer to investing so any help is appreciated thanks!","['MSFT', 'AMD', 'NKE', 'TSLA']"

mrnfq3,,stocks,post,1618518707,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

This comes on the heels of excellent bank earnings for Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. thanks to record liquidity and savings.

Record revenue and earnings are likely products of a busy year of acquisitions in 2020, which included the purchase of e*trade and Eaton Vance.

mrusuc,,stocks,post,1618543353,"Benchmarking performance and the impact of taxesThis is one of those ""lesson's learned"" posts which I'm putting up as a form of catharsis but also the hope that others can learn from my experiences.

The two biggest thing I've learned over the past 4 months of trading:

1. Everyone feels like a trading genius when the entire market is booming

2. Benchmarking performance sets a real world expectation for your actions

For #1, its self explanatory. In February I felt like the whole stock market thing was super easy. Just dump in money, wait for it to double and you're a trading genius. I thought the gravy train would never end, and I thought stocks only go up and stay up. Well, as we all know that is not the case. I got too confident and exuberant, and instead of setting stop losses or price targets or goals, I just let my entire portfolio ride in individual stocks. The market corrected and cratered from February 16 on wards. And to this day, even though VOO and QQQ are back up 10% from their March lows, my portfolio keeps losing money day after day because I didn't manage risk appropriately. Big lesson learned.

The more important thing to share though is how do you measure your performance as a trader/investor, identified in #2. This is very critical because active trading, and even active investing, requires mind share, mental commitment and resources. Additionally, if you're very active in your investing you'll also get hit with tax implications. All this stuff should be considered into the overall performance of your portfolio. Here's my personal experience and journey that I hope folks can learn from.

If I had taken my entire portfolio value on October 30 and just bought VOO with every last dollar, my performance for year to date would be 30% returns. Not bad for a low cost passive index fund.

Instead what I did was buy and sell stocks thinking I could be smarter than the aggregate market. My swing trades got me over confident since the performance of the stocks I was picking was incredible, and my short term holds ended up becoming long term investments because of my over confidence. I didn't have good set out exit points, so I would buy and just wait for the stock to go up. And as long as it was going up I kept holding. At one point, my portfolio was up 90% from October 30th levels, trading at a 60% return over VOO. I thought I was the smartest investor ever. Then February hit, then March hit, the April hit, and now my portfolio is actually trading at 2% below VOO levels. Everything always reverts to the mean. And I don't think the fuckfest is over, as EV and green tech is still undergoing a brutal correction.

The bigger thing to think about is now this: I have a bunch of individual stocks for which I don't have conviction. I never intended to hold them long, but I didn't manage risk appropriately to sell them. And EVEN IF I had sold them at their peak, at 90% gains, the tax man gonna come and clobber me for short term capital gains. That could be as low as 22% or as high as 38%.

So if I had 90% gains, and I got taxed at 24%, then my gains are actually 68%. Still better than VOO, but not as good before. But here is the big rub. Selling those stocks would have been a good move but as they started to correct to the mean, I held them thinking that they would return back to their original levels. I never sold, and I kept holding and holding. And during this entire time, I NEVER COMPARED TO MY BENCHMARK!

What I should have been doing is keeping a mental tally of when my account value would be equivalent to VOO performance with tax implications. And for me that would have occurred when my portfolio was at 45% gains. At 45% gains, I could have liquidated my account, paid the tax man, and been no worst off than if I had put my money into VOO and just held.

Well, I'm well below that at this point. My performance compared to VOO is now at a 2% loss, and even if i liquidate I'll still have the tax man to pay so I'm doing worst off over all. 

All that for the hours I spent researching trends, finding tickers, watching my profile every day. Easily 10 hours a week of work messing with my portfolio. Thats 10 hours a week for almost 5 months that I could have back if I had just bought VOO and forgotten about it.

What has all this taught me? Three big lessons:

1. Depending on your temperament and mental health, passive investing may be way better off than active investing. Also, factor in whether you're good at investing/trading. I realized I am not. I need to practice way more with smaller amounts of money before I make the jump from passive investing into active investing.

2. Finding stocks and buying them is only one piece of the puzzle. Another much more important piece is risk management, exit strategies and stop losses. Unless you are an investor, where you will buy and hold a stock forever, every entry needs to be timed with a mental exit. I failed at this so hard and I need to take a step back to reevaluate why I was so bad at this.

3. Always be benchmarking! Compare your portfolio's performance again S&P500 against 1month, 3 months, 6months and 12months. How are you doing? What decisions are you making that are paying off? Calculate your portfolio's internal Beta! My portfolio's beta was about 3 before the correction. After the correction my portfolio has a beta of -0.5. Thats a really hard pill to digest, but its super important to know how your portfolio moves compared to the market.


To anyone who actually read this wall of text, I hope it provided you some lessons that avoid the mistakes I made. I'm sure people will read this and reply with distasteful messages into this post. The important thing to know about all this is that investing is a long term game and strategy. Having one bad year should be a big learning experiencing. Go back and retest your strategies and learn from them. Take a step back and play with less money. Lean on index funds in the mean time to avoid the crush of inflation. Once you've honed a reliable strategy, then start to increase the amount of money with which you're playing.",['SPGI']

I also compare myself to the S&P (and I rarely win btw)... But I wouldn't sell my holdings once I hit the same YTD gains as the S&P because then I might as well just chuck all my funds into VOO and avoid the stress. But I have about 25-30% of my portfolio that I like to play around with riskier plays.

ms9ab7,gus8kga,stocks,comment,1618616650,"The real reason is that your broker needs to post collateral. The main job of a broker is to serve as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. If there is any doubt that one of the two parties will not be able to cover their obligations, then the broker is responsible for serving as the counterparty. In normal times, this is not a big deal since collateral is small but in times of volatility (especially the one saw intraday by GME), it is too risky for them and they don't allow trading of that particular stock. As the above poster mentioned, this is quite routine and literally happens every day with penny stocks.

It is not about the loss by one of the parties, it is about the counterparty risk. If a stock drops 50% but the broker can still find buyers and sellers, nothing happens. What happened is that the brokers could not find enough people quick enough to take the other side of the transactions.

RSI operates [https://www.betrivers.com](https://www.betrivers.com/) which is an online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in:

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, Virginia, and West Virginia.

\*\*\*\*The value\*\*\*\*

RSI has growth on pace with the king of gambling stocks DKNG. RSI is also guiding for 60% of the revenue of DKNG. Despite the amazing growth and guidance, RSI is trading close to 1/10th the market cap of DKNG. Based on their growth and future guidance, I would expect RSI to be trading closer to 1/2 the market cap of DKNG, or about $13.5 billion. That is 4.3x higher than the current market cap which is at about $3.1 billion market cap.

A quick comparison to SKLZ and DKNG below:

$SKLZ FY2021 Guidance = $366M w/ a market cap of $6.3B Forward PS = 17.2

$DKNG FY2021 Guidance = $950M w/ market cap $23.6B Forward PS = 24.8

$RSI FY2021 Guidance = $440M w/ Market cap $3.1B Forward PS = 7.0

Comparison of MAUs (Monthly active users) with DKNG

For RSI, Real-Money Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in the United States for the fourth quarter of 2020 were up 116% year-over-year and 22% sequentially from the third quarter, with average revenue per MAU (“ARPMAU”) of $328 during the fourth quarter of 2020. ([ir.rushstreetinteractive.co/](http://ir.rushstreetinteractive.co/)...)

For [DKNG](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/DKNG): Average Revenue per MUP (“ARPMUP”) was $65 in the fourth quarter representing a 55% increase versus the same period in 2019. ([draftkings.gcs-web.com/news](http://draftkings.gcs-web.com/news)...) RSI has plenty of room to grow and capture even more market share and their customers are spending about 5x as much as DKNG. I like my prospects with RSI

\*\*\*\*The finanacials\*\*\*\*

RSI crushed Q4 earnings and 2020 earnings overall. Here are the highlights.

Revenue was $278.5 million during full year 2020, an increase of 337%, compared to $63.7 million during full year 2019.

Net loss was $138.8 million during full year 2020, compared to a net loss of $22.5 million during full year 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 million during full year 2020, compared to $(7.8) million during full year 2019

According to Eilers and Krejcik, RSI’s U.S. online casino was the second largest online casino operator as measured by GGR for the full year.

RSI expects revenues for the full year ending December 31, 2021 to be between $420 and $460 million, up from our previous guidance of $320 million. At the midpoint of the range, revenue of $440 million represents 58% year-over-year expected revenue growth when compared to $278.5 million of revenues for 2020.

RSI has submitted applications to have its sportsbook and casino apps available for download in the Google Play Store for Android users in connection with Google’s decision to permit use of real money gaming apps in the United States for the first time.

mrzrjj,,stocks,post,1618566107,"Discovery Inc. DISCA DD & thoughts*Warning: I'm long shares and leaps of $DISCA so this post could be biased.*

Discovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

From looking at the app store, it seems people are really enjoying the Discovery+ app **4,9/5 stars** which would be a big concern if it wouldn't have a good reputation.

[App store review](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discovery-stream-tv-shows/id1498327873)

I don't see Discovery+ replacing Netflix or being the market leader. What I see is a certain group who do enjoy Discovery to also buy their subscription service.

&#x200B;

Netflix, HBOMax, Apple offer content which is uncomparable quality wise.

Discovery's is often something to just relax and watch, mellow content, background tv and can exist next to the other streaming giants for people wanting more variety.

Yes previous highs do not indicate that it would go back to them, however the rally started with discovery launching their Discovery+ model, you can clearly see that start January price took off and I believe for good reason as Discovery transforming their business model is actually a huge deal if succesful and that's what investors rallied towards. In the long term it all comes down to if Discovery+ would be getting lots of subscribers and create the revenue, market price should follow if they actually generate the $$$.

In February this year Discovery already had 11 million subscribers, exceeding wallstreet expectations, if they can keep this rate up I can see Discovery reaching 20M+ subs soon.

[11 million subscribers](https://www.nexttv.com/news/discovery-claims-vast-majority-of-its-11-million-ott-subscribers-belong-to-discovery-plus#:~:text=Since%20debuting%20%245%2Da%2Dmonth,5.2%20million%20subs%20in%20December)

Disney+ have over 100 million subscribers after 1,5 years.

\- If Discovery were to achieve 50M subs in 1,5 years (June 2023) I believe the company would be on the way to become a challenging streaming company.

As Discovery+ just launched mostly in Januari this year, i expect next earnings call to offer a lot more clarity to see how much there subscription base has grown and in what direction we can see the company moving.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrzrjj,guplfzo,stocks,comment,1618570877,"I bought Discovery at the bottom and that was a mistake imo. Discovery entire bull thesis is reliant on D+ working out. But let's look at what it is about. They charge $5 for a ad lite experience and $7 a ad free experience. Honestly I have 0 expertise in this form of monetization,  but as a user this would turn me away from continuing any subscription. The idea of a paying customer having to pay more to avoid ads just doesn't seem to make sense to me. It would probably turn away people away from it.

But more than anything else the thing that turns me off from Discovery is the programs they have. What do you imagine discovery to be about? Science, nature, education and exploration if the wider world. What is it in reality? 

-90 Day Fiance and spinoffs
-American Monster
-Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations
-Barefoot Contessa
-Chopped
-Deadliest Catch
-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives
-Disappeared
-Fixer Upper
-House Hunters
-Married at First Sight
-Planet Earth 
-The Pioneer Woman
-Property Brothers
-Say Yes to the Dress
-Sister Wives
-Super Soul Sunday

Other than Planet Earth everything else is a strong departure from what Discovery is about. Which of these would you pay $7 a month. Hell which of this would you pay $5 a month for? The shows they have are shows you watch when you got nothing on, not shows you would specifically pay for. In my opinion, unless D+ return to their biggest draw and what they are known for, I will steer clear.

However what is the difference between a Bank Note and a Treasury Note? Can't find much on this... Are they the same?

Anyone have some suggestions on good Bank Notes to purchase? Does Vanguard have any exceptional ones that they administrate? 

What would you consider an exceptional rate for a short term maturity like 3 years, and are there any other cost factors that I should be considering?",
msa0r0,gurboss,stocks,comment,1618600736,"The difference between a corporate bond and a treasury bond is who is holding the debt. You are loaning that entity your money during the duration of the bond, and each entity will have a different creditworthiness. The yield of corporate bonds is tied to treasury bonds, since corporate bonds are slightly more risky (risk of default), so they’ll typically have a slight yield premium over the respective treasury bond duration. 

The three year treasury currently has a yield rate of .338% APR, which I don’t think would cover inflation during that duration. If you are interested in bonds I would wait till interest rates increase, as they are expected to in 2023, yields should increase substantially.

mrxdyg,,stocks,post,1618554419,"Small amount to invest, single company share or multiple shares of ETF that holds the company?TLDR at the bottom.

I want to put $300 I've managed to save up into my IRA before I inadvertently spend it. I've always enjoyed tracking the market but haven't done so for years due to just being busy with regular work, however this recent market craziness is pulling me back in. 

I've been eyeing two companies specifically, Microsoft (MSFT) and Insulet (PODD). I like Microsoft because of their recent efforts at diversifying their income streams and investments and I became familiar with Insulet from a previous employer and I like their insulin pump equipment and approach. 

The thing is an individual share of either of these companies would take up a substantial portion of the $300. Should I take the risk and go in on one share of one company? Or search for a lower cost per share ETF that has relatively good exposure to these companies like EDOC for Insulet?

I know it's a small amount compared to how much others trade but I'm looking at this as a starting point for how I'll approach my investments moving forward so it's a big decision for me. Try stock picking and chase higher gains? Or try to diversify for some security?

For context, I'm in my 30's so retirement is far away and have reasonably good risk tolerance as the IRA is a buy and hold account. However I've been burned many many times by my stock picking activities and have lost some self confidence. 

Any of your experienced and skilled advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

TLDR: With a very small pot of cash ($300) in a long term buy and hold account, better to buy one expensive company share or multiple shares of company-holding ETF?",['MSFT']

There was a little freakout when there was yield curve inversion but that didn't amount to anything. Also back then there wasn't so much crap released on the market. WeWork was the biggest crappy company everyone was talking about but we didn't have 10 worthless SPACs coming out every week. Oh, and WSB back then was actually interesting sub where there were few intelligent discussions about options strategies (hard to believe now). In any case things were expensive and everyone was literally waiting for crash. Like I'm not even kidding. Every second post was about everything being too expensive and how everyone can't wait for crash to happen because it will be so awesome to load on on some cheap equities. Then Covid happened and its interesting to remember how it evolved from ""its just another virus in China, makes no difference to us"" to ""I lost everything and thinking about suicide"". It was some especial experience lurking here over March - April. Then we muddled through and had unbelievable recovery. Everything in 2018 is now amplified 100x. Equities are way more expensive, companies have more debt, many people lost jobs and so much speculative bullshit is released every week. Unlike in 2018 everyone is super optimistic about the future. Stocks only go up, just delete your app and come back in a month, the Fed will not allow crash to happen. All that. This is very interesting and I'm so interested to see where this will end up.",['AAPL']

msncop,guv4619,investing,comment,1618673986,"Hey all,

&#x200B;

This is a very naive question, but I can not seem to find a clear answer on the matter. But first, some context before my silly question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks is a really interesting private company that markets its-self as the organism company; meaning they use genetic engineering and advanced genomics to create custom organisms that can produce special interest ingredients (eg, pharma, fragrance, high-cost input chemicals) or design and implementing microorganisms to solve specific industry issues (eg, microorganisms that can symbiotically live in the roots of commercial crops to help transfer nutrients to decrease costs and environmental impact of using fertilizers). Really cool Jurassic Park type stuff LOL!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ginkgo Bioworks has been rumored to be in talks with a special-purpose acquisition company Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU) and going public via a reverse merger. This has been reported in both the Boston Business Journal as well as Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/ginkgo-bioworks-said-to-explore-over-20-billion-sloan-spac-deal)).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question is, if this happens, would Ginkgo trade as Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp (SRNGU), meaning one could buy-in now before anything happens.... Or would a new ticker be launched separate from (SRNGU) and one should just wait for the Ginkgo ticker? Really just want to get ahead of this before they go public (if they go public).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, understood that if they do not reach a deal, one could be bag-holding (SRNGU)...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Any help or guidance on this speculation would be appreciated.",

*Ben Dunham (CFO):*

* Note that our occupancy reaches 85% in 2024, which we feel confident in given our mature buildings have historically achieved 88% occupancy.
* This revenue growth, along with the significant cost savings that Sandeep had mentioned previously sets us up to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by Q4 2021 and eventually $2 billion in 2024.
* One really important point is that the core business with no additional new buildings and no new growth products becomes a $5 billion business in revenue, and 1 billion in EBITDA by 2023.
* We expect to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by Q4 2021.
* The pro forma equity value is $7.9 billion with a total enterprise value of $9 billion.
* This valuation puts the TEV to 2023 EBITDA multiple at 6.6 times.
* The pro forma cash at the close of this transaction is expected to be $1.9 billion with total liquidity of $2.4 billion.

*Sandeep Mathrani (CEO)*

* The revenue in 2020 was flat to 2019.
* We've shaved $1.8 billion of expenses from our company.
* In the space as a service business, according to CBRE by 2030, 13% of the space in the United States will become flex. Today any person you speak to: CEO, CHRO, CFO of a company, theyre going to tell you 10 to 20% of their space needs to be in a flex format. If all we do is maintain the same penetration rate and thats all we do, invest our capital, keep the space as a service, our existing portfolio would stabilize at $5 billion dollars of revenue
* The asset light model comes in two flavors. The first flavor is WeWork branded. Thats what you can do, a management agreement, a revenue share agreement and use that platform. The second is a white label.
* If you could just get them to come onto your tech platform, all of them operate today in a very manual manner. And if you can do that, all of a sudden, youve gotten 5,000 vacation rentals or 5,000 Uber cars. And all of a sudden you become a middleware company.

*Vivek Ranadive (BOWX)*

* Theres $15 billion in invested capital, theres billions more that landlords themselves have invested. Its a global brand. Theyve got a platform, theyve got a whole solution, and it would take tens of billions of dollars to recreate this brand.
* This is a company that in the past has grown at a hundred percent year over year, year after year, and all they have to do is hold on to their share of the market. And it becomes a very, very big business.
* Just with their existing capacity, its a $5 billion revenue company with over $1 billion in EBITDA.
* We have a world-class CEO operating this business. Sandeep is a legend in real estate. Hes the Mr. Fix-It of real estate. And what hes done in 12 months is not just turned it around, but hes transformed the business.

[4/6 NYU REIT Panel](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001813756/000119312521107765/d355302d425.htm)

* We have 30 plus markets that have seen green shoots with double digit increase in occupancy and in like whether its China, but, you know, Beijing 14 points in Shanghai, 12 points and Seoul, Korea double-digits and Munich 44 points in Manchester, UK 26 points
* We have an amazing tech platform. And again we are a real estate business, not a tech company.
* we are the largest landlord in the world for a number of locations, maybe not number of square feet, but the number of locations
* I wasnt out there looking to become a public entity this quickly. But I was thinking about how to raise equity and de-risk the balance sheet to make sure that we will be the winner as we come out of COVID.
* we started to see the green shoots in the business, which is very important, we could start to see that youve hit bottom and youre starting to rise.
* Again, having been a public company CEO, I wanted to make sure that I had hit bottom and I was starting to rise.
* Our PIPE was meant to be 500 million and we raised 800 million with subscription agreements with some of the best investors in the business.
* We have enough liquidity on our balance sheet but it will provide us liquidity for growth. And if for whatever reason, there is a slow down, because of the virus, we have enough liquidity, but I think we all see light at the end of the tunnel. So this will be used for growth capital.

4/14 Medium Article (cannot link, but you find via Google News)

* Office real estate in the U.S. alone is a $2.5 trillion asset class
* to the boards credit, the company fired the Jesus of reclaimed wood and smoked glass, Adam Neumann, and brought in an experienced manager. Sandeep Mathrani shed 100 of the companys worst-performing properties along with the self-dealing arrangements foisted on the company by Neumann and laid off 8,000 employees.
* The new WeWork is a stronger company than the 2017 model. Its still not worth $50 billion, but it might be worth $9B (or more).
* The new WeWork will benefit from the massive investments in space and brand equity (i.e., global awareness); additionally, people underestimate the difficulty of scaling “vibe,” where WeWork has a proven talent.

4/14 Korea Herald (cannot link, but you can find via Google News)

* Driven by corporate demand for alternative offices amid the pandemic, WeWork Koreas revenue last year jumped 20 percent“We see improvement in vacancy rate. The occupancy rate looks to be not too different from before the pandemic,” she said during an interview at the Korean headquarters in Euljiro, central Seoul, Tuesday.
* “WeWork is the only co-working company that offers work spaces for Fortune-listed companies, like Google, Amazon and Samsung, as well as small startups and individual entrepreneurs in Korea, so it is very crucial to offer the same quality and safe services across its different locations,” she said.
* “Under the first generation of WeWork executives, the company put focus only on expansion, which I dont think was a totally wrong scheme for an IT company. Under the new leadership, which I call WeWork 2.0, however, the company will be laser-focused on improving profitability,” she said.

* ·WeWork Chief Executive Sandeep Mathrani said Wednesday the co-working firm is “completely on track” to reach profitability by the fourth quarter of this year, and its office spaces in China have nearly bounced back to pre-pandemic levels.
* WeWork locations in China “are back to virtually 90% of pre-COVID levels from an occupancy perspective and leasing and demand perspective,” Mathrani said.

The last time I posted about weed stocks, I explained how US cannabis stocks (ie Trulieve/Cresco/Greenthumb/Curaleaf) are all awaiting big legislative changes throughout the year.

I'm posting now, because the first big piece of legislation, the SAFE act, is finally being introduced to Congress next week.

>The message, which was sent to stakeholders on Friday by a staffer for Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the bill’s sponsor, says that while the office is still awaiting scheduling confirmation, they “think the bill will be on the House floor for a vote early next week,” and that will be confirmed when the full calendar is released by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) “later today.”

SAFE act is a game-changer US MSOs that currently bleed absurd amounts of money and resources because of harsh federal banking restrictions.

>The legislation would ensure that financial institutions could take on cannabis business clients without facing federal penalties. Fear of sanctions has kept many banks and credit unions from working with the industry, forcing marijuana firms to operate on a cash basis that makes them targets of crime and creates complications for financial regulators.

As this news has been confirmed by a fresh leak (that was only published within the hour I'm making this post) there is an opportunity to buy the *""rumour""* in sense as the market has yet to react today. Noone knew when exactly this bill was coming until now so I would act fast if you're interested in beating the hype storm that will come next week once this bill is officially revealed and passed by the House.",['ED']

[To adjust for this you can buy an ETF with a focus on China, e.g. VWO.](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/vwo)

Assuming prices of ETFs are the same, holding 0.71x VWO for every VT would give weights that match GDP distribution closely.

Adjusting for prices, which are not same (VT = $101.83 and VWO = $52.78), gives 1.37x VWO for every VT.

EDIT: I stand corrected. Many have pointed out that the stock market is not the economy. VT holdings are based on market capitalization. China apparently has a high GDP, but not so many publicly companies traded companies with a high market cap (see  comment of [irresponsible\_owl](https://www.reddit.com/user/irresponsible_owl/)). Comparing [market cap of companies by country](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD/rankings) with the market allocation of VT shows a smaller descrepancy than with GDP, but still it seems like US is overweighted (57% instead of 42%).",['BR']

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this).

The good stuff: the data that got these giant institutional investors Vadafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Samsung NEXT, AT&T, Cisneros all lined up to give money to AST Spacemobile started with the tiny 12kg Bluewalker 1 satellite that successfully proved that AST tech worked:

""*On April 1, 2019, AST successfully launched  BW1, which connected directly to an antenna (“BW2”) at AST’s facility in Midland, Texas, to test its satellite to ground communications  technology. During such testing, AST was able to validate its cellular  architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO  orbit and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G-LTE protocol.*""

The 1.5 ton, 10-meter antenna Bluewalker 3 satellite currently in progress of being built and is slated to launch at the end of 2021 is much more capable and will fully enable AST to demonstrate their tech:

""*The BW3 test satellite is expected to enable live ground, sea, and  airborne testing with unmodified LTE and 5G devices such as smartphones, tablets and internet of things (“IoT”) equipment. The satellite is also  expected to enable live testing for voice, video and data. Testing will  be available for approximately six minutes per satellite pass  approximately two times per day in certain areas. For U.S. based  testing, AST will utilize a gateway installed in Midland, Texas and in  Hawaii. AST will install at least two additional gateways for the full constellation, one on the east coast and a second on the west coast. With the BW3 test satellite, AST’s main objective is to demonstrate the entire technology stack of the AST constellation satellite design by  providing direct broadband communications between an AST- patented LEO  satellite and standard compliant LTE and 5G devices without any  modification using UE standard in select bands in the 698 MHz to 960 MHz range and using gateways located in a number of selected countries, including the U.S. The BW3 test satellite will provide the testing and validation plans for the BB1 satellite design, expected to be used for  the first phase of commercial satellites comprising the SpaceMobile  Service.*""

Lynk, a competing company, also [demonstrated](https://vimeo.com/398041128/e10228da19) the technology worked when they successfully connected a tiny satellite to a normal handset and witnessed by independent third-party observers:

Additionally, **Apple** is [reportedly](https://www.channelnews.com.au/telstra-set-to-become-surplus-to-requirement-if-apple-satellite-iphones-take-off/) not holding back on putting a lot of resources to dive into this potentially massively lucrative market:

""*Currently Apple is spending billions, developing a new satellite service  that will beam internet services directly to devices, bypassing carrier  networks*"" 

Apple has [already started the process](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1160408/apple-fi-5g-killer-technology-profits-confidential-by-ray-blanco--anti5g-stock-research-report) of doing the very thing that AST Spacemobile is set up to do, calling it Apple-Fi:

""***To roll out its revolutionary technology, Apple has reportedly hired  Michael Trela and John Fenwick, two world-famous aerospace engineers who  are widely considered to be pioneers in the field of satellite  technology. Not only that, Apple also recently brought onboard Matt Ettus, Ashley Moore Williams, and Daniel Ellis, experts renowned for  their work with wireless technologies. Not only that, but it is also  being alleged that Apple is currently in the process of creating a  satellite mesh network to provide its customers with insane network  coverage. In this regard, the company has already filed plans with the  FCC to launch between 1,400 and 3,000 satellites.***""

In order to connect from Earth to space LEO and back, you either need a big dish/antenna on Earth to connect to a small satellite or increase the size of the satellite to connect to a small, normal cellphone. A fairly long technical paper submitted to the FCC [here](https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2511994) describes how AST Spacemobile will use its constellation of satellites to act as a 900 meters squared satellite. This is proven tech and has been done many times.

The document found [here](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10061972201614/AST%205G%20Fund%20Ex%20Parte%2010-06-20%20(00168439xC33F1).pdf) submitted to the FCC describing how they brilliantly deal with doppler issue:

Some interesting technical points were described in the document:

""*-The AST low earth orbiting (“LEO”) satellites system (“SpaceMobile”)  is able to communicate directly with standard unmodified off-the shelf  cellular devices from their 700 kilometer high orbits through the use of  AST’s patented architecture of large LEO satellites with  specially-designed proprietary antenna arrays with very large aperture.  The configuration results in enough antenna gain to enable the satellite  to communicate effectively with standard mobile handsets operating on  terrestrial broadband wireless frequencies.*

*- The  AST SpaceMobile system will connect to user terminals that operate on  standard 3GPP  frequencies that are licensed to terrestrial carriers  with which AST has agreements that grant AST consent to use the  spectrum.  The service will fill the terrestrial carriers’ gaps in  coverage to provide broadband mobile services where the terrestrial  carrier spectrum is not available or in use. This mitigates and  eliminates the risk of interference.*

*-  Potential interference also will be managed by the use of other  methods, including frequency selection, Inter-Cell Interference  Coordination (ICIC), beams control, and power control. These techniques  are discussed at length in the Technical Sharing Analysis submitted to  the Commission by AST on July 6, 2020;amendment to IBFS File No.  SAT-PDR-20200413-00034 (Call Sign S3065).*

*- Each  satellite is capable of supporting approximately 2800 spot beams. The  satellite can generate cellular cells ranging from 12.5 kilometers  (C-band and CBRS) to 24-48kilometers (Lowband and midband). The  above-referenced Technical Sharing Analysis contains an overview of the  SpaceMobile approaches for frequency sharing and interference management  using parameters in this range.*

*- The SpaceMobile  service will meet a low(sub-100 ms) latency(with latency well below 40  ms). AST holds,and/or has pending, approximately 650 patent claims,many  of which pertain to advanced technology that will be implemented on the  ground to address Doppler and delay.*

*- The SpaceMobile service will meet and exceed the download and upload speed requirements of 35 Mbps / 3 Mbps.*

*-  AST’s patented technology incorporates beam handover,which is analogous  to the terrestrial user equipment (UE) handoff between neighboring base stations (eNodeB’s).  Based on the schedule files that list the handoff  time instances, the setting satellite simultaneously turns off,and the  rising satellite turns on a beam in the overlapping cell.AST’s patented  technologies for compensation of delay/Doppler makes the UEs in the cell  being handed off see near equal delay/Doppler before and after the handoff, making them synchronize quickly to new beams from rising formation. The UE keeps track of the received signal strength (RSSI) of  both the serving and adjacent beams. When the serving beam’s RSSI is  weaker than the adjacent beam’s RSSI, it requests serving eNodeB to initiate handoff. The decision to hand off or not is made by the serving eNodeB.*""

Here, AST claimed that their proprietary  antenna arrays with very large aperture allow them to have enough gain to communicate with mobile handsets. They also claim to have download/upload speed of at least 35 Mbps/3 Mbps and a latency well below 40ms. These numbers are highly conservative just to show that AST at minimum should qualify for a huge 5G grant. Starlink is on the same LEO as AST will be and Starlink is able to do latency in the 20's ms, which is inline with current terrestrial broadband/5G.

""*AST is building a new, unproven type of satellite constellation that’s a  riff on so-called “fractionated satellites,” which divide the  capability of one large satellite among several smaller ones. For  example, one satellite might host a scientific payload, while another  might be responsible for communicating with ground stations. The two  would communicate with one another through wireless links. A  fractionated satellite system has never flown in orbit, although Darpa  spent six years and more than $200 million dollars developing a  fractionated satellite before abandoning the concept in 2013 due to  budgetary constraints.*

*AST’s system will consist  of dozens of small, pizza box-sized satellites flying in formation as  they receive cell signals. According to AST’s founder and CEO Abel  Avellan, the system isn’t truly fractionated because each of the small  satellites will have the same capabilities, rather than splitting the  functionality of one larger satellite. But the formation will be managed  by a large control satellite, which will direct network traffic and  satellite movement like a conductor leading an orchestra. Although the  later versions of the satellites in AST’s system will communicate with  one another over Wi-Fi or a similar wireless protocol, Avellan says the  first satellites to go up will be physically connected.*

*The  advantage of AST’s approach is that the satellites can be spread out  over hundreds of feet. Since each satellite is itself a receiver and is  working in tandem with the others, this has the effect of creating a  massive antenna. “In essence we are building a very, very large  satellite with a lot of power that can connect directly to a handset,”  says Avellan. “Our system is a replica of the terrestrial network in  space.”*""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The CEO himself is an engineer and communication/satellite genius. He's not a salesman and definitely isn't the type that can get all of those giant institutions to invest in $ASTS through words instead of concrete data. There are more patents and technical stuff dealing with waveform and others but I found them to be uninteresting to traders and not worth listing them all.

To conclude, anyone that claims this stock goes to zero is ignorant to the technical data at hand and completely dismisses the incredible work AST Spacemobile research team has done. I have a strong belief that any analyst from the [numerous banks](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1373825830938378241) Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Raymond James, Scotia, LightShed and Benchmark that attended AST Spacemobile analyst day will have favorable price target and analysis.","['DISH', 'AAPL', 'TWTR', 'AMT', 'MS']"

mrhrgv,,investing,post,1618502557,"Jeff Bezos Releases Final Letter To Amazon Shareholders""In Amazon’s 1997 letter to shareholders, our first, I talked about our hope to create an “enduring franchise,” one that would reinvent what it means to serve customers by unlocking the internet’s power. I noted that Amazon had grown from having 158 employees to 614, and that we had surpassed 1.5 million customer accounts. We had just gone public at a split-adjusted stock price of $1.50 per share. I wrote that it was Day 1.

We’ve come a long way since then, and we are working harder than ever to serve and delight customers. Last year, we hired 500,000 employees and now directly employ 1.3 million people around the world. We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualized run rate. In 1997, we hadn’t invented Prime, Marketplace, Alexa, or AWS. They weren’t even ideas then, and none was preordained. We took great risk with each one and put sweat and ingenuity into each one.

Along the way, we’ve created $1.6 trillion of wealth for shareowners. Who are they? Your Chair is one, and my Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others. Who are they? They’re pension funds, universities, and 401(k)s, and they’re Mary and Larry, who sent me this note out of the blue just as I was sitting down to write this shareholder letter:

I am approached with similar stories all the time. I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on. I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.

### Create More Than You Consume

If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.

Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.

For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.

We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century.

So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventy-five hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation.

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.

Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.

Summarizing:  
Shareholders      $21B  
Employees          $91B  
3P Sellers            $25B  
Customers           $164B  
Total                    $301B

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.

Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting.

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too.

Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.

If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work.

Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule.

We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching.

Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

### Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work

The fact is, the large team of thousands of people who lead operations at Amazon have always cared deeply for our hourly employees, and we’re proud of the work environment we’ve created. We’re also proud of the fact that Amazon is a company that does more than just create jobs for computer scientists and people with advanced degrees. We create jobs for people who never got that advantage.

Despite what we’ve accomplished, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees’ success. We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company. We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value. I’m excited to work alongside the large team of passionate people we have in Ops and help invent in this arena of Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. On the details, we at Amazon are always flexible, but on matters of vision we are stubborn and relentless. We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.

We dive deep into safety issues. For example, about 40% of work-related injuries at Amazon are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), things like sprains or strains that can be caused by repetitive motions. MSDs are common in the type of work that we do and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. We need to invent solutions to reduce MSDs for new employees, many of whom might be working in a physical role for the first time.

One such program is WorkingWell – which we launched to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe in 2020 – where we coach small groups of employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities outside work.

We’re developing new automated staffing schedules that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks. This new technology is central to a job rotation program that we’re rolling out throughout 2021.

Our increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32%, and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half.

We employ 6,200 safety professionals at Amazon. They use the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. In 2021, we’ll invest more than $300 million into safety projects, including an initial $66 million to create technology that will help prevent collisions of forklifts and other types of industrial vehicles.

When we lead, others follow. Two and a half years ago, when we set a $15 minimum wage for our hourly employees, we did so because we wanted to lead on wages – not just run with the pack – and because we believed it was the right thing to do. A recent paper by economists at the University of California-Berkeley and Brandeis University analyzed the impact of our decision to raise our minimum starting pay to $15 per hour. Their assessment reflects what we’ve heard from employees, their families, and the communities they live in.

Our increase in starting wage boosted local economies across the country by benefiting not only our own employees but also other workers in the same community. The study showed that our pay raise resulted in a 4.7% increase in the average hourly wage among other employers in the same labor market.

And we’re not done leading. If we want to be Earth’s Best Employer, we shouldn’t settle for 94% of employees saying they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. We have to aim for 100%. And we’ll do that by continuing to lead on wages, on benefits, on upskilling opportunities, and in other ways that we will figure out over time.

If any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.

### The Climate Pledge

In an earlier draft of this letter, I started this section with arguments and examples designed to demonstrate that human-induced climate change is real. But, bluntly, I think we can stop saying that now. You don’t have to say that photosynthesis is real, or make the case that gravity is real, or that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. These things are simply true, as is the reality of climate change.

Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better. Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future. This doesn’t mean it will be easy. It won’t be. The coming decade will be decisive. The economy in 2030 will need to be vastly different from what it is today, and Amazon plans to be at the heart of the change. We launched The Climate Pledge together with Global Optimism in September 2019 because we wanted to help drive this positive revolution. We need to be part of a growing team of corporations that understand the imperatives and the opportunities of the 21st century.

Now, less than two years later, 53 companies representing almost every sector of the economy have signed The Climate Pledge. Signatories such as Best Buy, IBM, Infosys, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Siemens, and Verizon have committed to achieve net-zero carbon in their worldwide businesses by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge also requires them to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis; implement decarbonization strategies through real business changes and innovations; and neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. Credible, quality offsets are precious, and we should reserve them to compensate for economic activities where low-carbon alternatives don’t exist.

The Climate Pledge signatories are making meaningful, tangible, and ambitious commitments. Uber has a goal of operating as a zero-emission platform in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. by 2030, and Henkel plans to source 100% of the electricity it uses for production from renewable sources. Amazon is making progress toward our own goal of 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of our initial 2030 target. Amazon is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world. We have 62 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 125 solar rooftops on fulfillment and sort centers around the globe. These projects have the capacity to generate over 6.9 gigawatts and deliver more than 20 million megawatt-hours of energy annually.

Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and the toughest part of our plan to meet net-zero carbon by 2040. To help rapidly accelerate the market for electric vehicle technology, and to help all companies transition to greener technologies, we invested more than $1 billion in Rivian – and ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the company. We’ve also partnered with Mahindra in India and Mercedes-Benz in Europe. These custom electric delivery vehicles from Rivian are already operational, and they first hit the road in Los Angeles this past February. Ten thousand new vehicles will be on the road as early as next year, and all 100,000 vehicles will be on the road by 2030 – saving millions of metric tons of carbon. A big reason we want companies to join The Climate Pledge is to signal to the marketplace that businesses should start inventing and developing new technologies that signatories need to make good on the Pledge. Our purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans is a perfect example.

To further accelerate investment in new technologies needed to build a zero-carbon economy, we introduced the Climate Pledge Fund last June. The investment program started with $2 billion to invest in visionary companies that aim to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Amazon has already announced investments in CarbonCure Technologies, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, Turntide Technologies, ZeroAvia, and Infinium – and these are just some of the innovative companies we hope will build the zero-carbon economy of the future.

I have also personally allocated $10 billion to provide grants to help catalyze the systemic change we will need in the coming decade. We’ll be supporting leading scientists, activists, NGOs, environmental justice organizations, and others working to fight climate change and protect the natural world. Late last year, I made my first round of grants to 16 organizations working on innovative and needle-moving solutions. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals, and I’m excited to be part of this journey and optimistic that humanity can come together to solve this challenge.

### Differentiation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical

This is my last annual shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon, and I have one last thing of utmost importance I feel compelled to teach. I hope all Amazonians take it to heart.

Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins’ (extraordinary) book The Blind Watchmaker. It’s about a basic fact of biology.

“Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at. Left to itself – and that is what it is when it dies – the body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as the temperature, the acidity, the water content or the electrical potential in a living body, you will typically find that it is markedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings, and in cold climates they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die the work stops, the temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature, but all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against a natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail they die. More generally, if living things didn’t work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings, and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die.”

While the passage is not intended as a metaphor, it’s nevertheless a fantastic one, and very relevant to Amazon. I would argue that it’s relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? To keep alive the thing or things that make you special?

I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, “Can’t you just be normal?” They both smile and laugh, and of course the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But, at the same time, it’s also true that things would often be easier – take less energy – if we were a little more normal.

This phenomenon happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stopped doing all of the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny.

We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen.

You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it. The fairy tale version of “be yourself” is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don’t expect it to be easy or free. You’ll have to put energy into it continuously.

The world will always try to make Amazon more typical – to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.

\* \* \*

As always, I attach our 1997 shareholder letter. It concluded with this: “We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.” That hasn’t changed a bit. I want to especially thank Andy Jassy for agreeing to take on the CEO role. It’s a hard job with a lot of responsibility. Andy is brilliant and has the highest of high standards. I guarantee you that Andy won’t let the universe make us typical. He will muster the energy needed to keep alive in us what makes us special. That won’t be easy, but it is critical. I also predict it will be satisfying and oftentimes fun. Thank you, Andy.

To all of you: be kind, be original, create more than you consume, and never, never, never let the universe smooth you into your surroundings. It remains Day 1.

Sincerely,

To our shareowners:

mru1gk,,investing,post,1618540606,"There’s a single New Jersey deli doing $35,000 in sales valued at $100 million in the stock marketHedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.

The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.

“Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,” Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.

Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.

Still, the company’s market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.

Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company’s securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli’s phone number.

According to the company’s latest 10-K filing, the company’s single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company’s stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.

The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.

Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.

Einhorn’s highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.

As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like Game Stop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.

The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

From the S-1/a - it looks like the deli closed due to covid and my guess is that in an effort to stay afloat, they did a private offer of 2.5M shares at $1/share. On 12/30/2020 - they estimated to have 60 shareholders.

They went public presumably to add liquidity.

The stock trades only about 500 shares per day.

This stock is a great example of retail investors that do zero basic research and simply jump into a position based on only on hearsay.

\[edit\] - I would hesitate to call this a scam - it looks like it was a struggling deli and they needed to raise funds. Instead of taking a loan - they went to the capital markets to sell equity. The S1/A looks pretty realistic. And the risks are pretty clear.

\[edit\] - the ownership structure is kinda interesting. The two people that run the company that presumably owned the deli are local teachers in the public school in that town. It looks like they engaged with some guy - Peter Coker, Jr (some guy in North Carolina) who probably is the one that orchestrated this. Mr. Coker is listed as chairman and he bought a lot of the shares a few thousand bucks. But he's provided loans back to the company. And he has setup some off-shore shell companies in Macau and Hong Kong which owns a lot of the shares as well.",

mrudu8,,investing,post,1618541849,"(PDAC) Li-Cycle Thesis and thoughts. Open for discussion.I understand SPAC's are considered troublemakers at the moment however I believe that this one has some substantial post merger potential.

Li-Cycle is the leading recycler of Lithium Ion batteries in North America. They plan to use a SPAC merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp. The merger will allow Li-Cycle to construct new plants to increase their production capacity by roughly 34,000% by the year 2025.

&#x200B;

* Lithium EV batteries are a real and threat to the environment. Not only is the mining detrimental but so is the disposal of them in landfills where they leak hazardous chemicals. This makes recycling the material an necessity for a sustainable future. A famous CEO recently said that he sees a world where lithium mining will cease and that all new lithium batteries can be made with recycled lithium. Currently 98% of lead-acid batteries get recycled but only 2% of lithium is recycled. That is where with Li-Cycle comes in.  
* Although Li-Cycle has a very aggressive growth plan, their future intake and offtake are already contracted through 2030. All of their growth projections show what growth could look like up to 2025, however their contracts continue into 2030. 
* Something that could interrupt their growth are new players in the field. Although they have patented their technology, Tesla is working on their own lithium recycling solution, and upgrading the battery technology to give batteries a lower environmental impact. Although Tesla plans to try to cut out lithium recyclers when recycling their batteries, they currently recycle through third parties. The firm Tesla currently uses to recycle their batteries is called Redwood Materials. The process they use is reportedly very harsh on the environment as it requires burning the lithium releasing toxic gasses into the atmosphere.
* A promising catalyst for fast growth is the current Biden administration. They are looking at passing a $2T infrastructure plan which would likely include provisions for providing contracts and subsidies to make it even more profitable.
* I believe that Li-Cycles growth is significantly de-risked and makes the post merger valuation fairly inexpensive. I recommend it as a buy with a price target of $20.","['DE', 'TSLA']"

mrudu8,gupbkqa,investing,comment,1618561910,"I'm in ABML myself. I've had my eye on Li-Cycle and at one point had a position but since sold. Someone contacted them and was told they capture 95% of extracted materials which isn't bad but it's on par with the smelting that Redwood Materials does. ABML is close to establishing their pilot plant but they already have a closed loop system that extracts 99%+ of materials. It's also a proven and BASF award winner / established partnership (they continue to use their Facilities in the US). 

Make no mistake I think you can't go wrong with investing a small portion into either stock. Both are highly speculative but that's what you get with an industry that's in it's infancy and penny stock / SPACs. I love these as a shovel play.

One thing both the Trump and Biden administrations have agreed on is  that the U.S. needs to expand domestic manufacturing, and soon.

The  pharmaceutical industry in particular has outsourced much of its  manufacturing to take advantage of lower costs and more lax  environmental laws in other countries.

mrow7p,gunvqlb,investing,comment,1618528650,"Keep in mind this is highly anecdotal because it's just my opinion as a pharma chemist for over 10 years now, I've worked for a couple start-ups, a couple global top 5 corporations, and a few others like generics.

I don't think the problem is our production capabilities. It's really not too difficult for me to find a job, even in a lot of rural areas. If the government really wanted to they could use the defense production act to pump out assloads of covid vaccines. The problem lies in how the industry works these days.

The big boys - Pfizer, Merck, Bayer... - don't really do much true R&D anymore, it's a better business model for them to let the small fries do that and then just buy them. They have production capabilities but they're relatively limited because they're focused on high volume of specific formulations. As far as markets go, this is the glamorous biotech/pharma wealth and risk everyone is familiar with.

But there's a middle group too, and it's huge. There are thousands of mid-sized pharma companies that usually produce either generics or less profitable out-of-patent pharmaceuticals that are anything but glamorous. This is where America's production ability lies, but the problems with tapping it all stem from the corporate... ecosystem, I guess.

The big boys have the most cutting edge patents (and if they don't they buy them, like Pfizer did with BioNTech), so getting them to share with a handful or more mid-sized companies is difficult. But if you manage that the next issue arises in the meeting of two very different worlds; big pharma and still-tiny-but-not-startup-tiny pharma. It's been going very smoothly so far though, the only problem we've seen was with the Baltimore company making J&J's vaccine.

So to try and relate this to the stock market..... I guess Biden could incentivize big pharma to share important patents with mid-sized companies? Invest in Regeneron?

Maybe there's an etf that focuses on not just mid cap, but mid-range production (volume) companies but other than that I don't see a greater than average profit without getting lucky on a stock.","['UPS', 'PFE', 'MRK']"

Generics are very much a race to the bottom. Very slim margins and plenty of competition for abroad. The larger pharma industry is shifting towards biopharma which will make the future even harder for generics companies unless the FDA changes how biosimilars are treated.

**What is Coinbase?**

* Founded in 2012, Coinbase is mainly known as a company that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies regardless if you’re an everyday investor or a hedge fund
* The company serves 43 million retail users, 7,000 institutions like hedge funds, and 115,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries
* **On the retail side,** Coinbase’s main products are its mobile app which has a super easy to use interface and then there’s Coinbase Pro which is more for advanced traders
* **On the business side,** Coinbase also offers a lot of really interesting services, including trading for institutions, listing assets on Coinbase which probably comes at a high cost, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments, cryptocurrency custody which just means helping institutions store crypto assets securely, and a venture capital arm that invests in crypto startups
* **Main point:** Coinbase is much more than just a place to trade crypto and the company is creating an ecosystem where different parts of the business feed off each other to make the entire platform stronger

**The Coinbase Business Model**

* To understand where Coinbase sees its business going, it’s important to first go over some context about the crypto market in general
* I bring up the data below to show you that the crypto market is still in its early stages and is highly volatile
   * Since 2010, there were [4 major price cycles with peaks and troughs and each cycle lasted anywhere from 2-4 years](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d780a9f051a4bad78f1d0_Crypto%20Market%20Troughs.jpg)
   * Crypto was also uncorrelated to the equities market until Feb 2020 when COVID hit and [now there seems to be some correlation](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d781a08359644dfcf2a06_Crypto%20vs%20S%26P.jpg)
* Coinbase currently profits the most during periods of high volatility and high bitcoin prices and makes less during lower periods of volatility and low bitcoin prices
   * This is precisely why since 2018, Coinbase has been making a concerted effort to diversify its revenue streams in order to decrease its reliance on market volatility
* Since 2016, [7 of the 8 new products have been subscription and services](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d76da0e9756ba0684199b_Product.jpg) which really just shows you Coinbase’s focus on building a more stable business which as a potential Coinbase investor will be important to pay attention to over time 
* This strategy seems to already be producing results, with monthly transacting users appearing to be less correlated to crypto volatility but still related to bitcoin prices
   * For example, you can see that [volatility was at a 9 in both Q1 2020 and Q4 2020](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7d843678f71c68ee167_MTUs%20and%20Crypto%20Asset%20Volatility.jpg) but the number of users is much greater in Q4 which was also when bitcoin began rising dramatically 

**Market Statistics**

* Over the past 3 years, Coinbase has been able to more than **double its users from** [**23 million**](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603dc7b0c5104fd10398b398_Verified%20Users.jpg) **to** [**56 million**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) which is really amazing growth 
* As a result, the company has been able to **grow its market share from 4.5% to** [**11.3%**](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021006601?cik=1679788) over the past few years which is also quite impressive 
* **In terms of the total market,** since the end of 2012 to the end of 2020, the cryptocurrency market grew from $500 million to $782 billion which represents a 150% CAGR
   * Astonishingly, in just a few months, the **market cap has grown by about 181% to \~$2.2 trillion as of toda**y 
   * Simply put, of all the industries I’ve personally seen so far, there is none that is growing as quickly as the cryptocurrency market

**The Bull Case**

* First off is Coinbase’s branding
   * Especially for those in the states, Coinbase is **one of the top go-to crypto exchanges** for the average retail investor and many institutions
   * This in large part is due to the company’s **intense focus on following regulations** and the company dedicates 15% of its full time staff to legal, compliance, finance, and security functions
   * From the start, Coinbase also created one of the **easiest interfaces** for trading a very complex product and that has continued to be its edge ever since
   * Personally, I believe that this first mover advantage may erode over time as Coinbase charges the highest fees per trade, but I also believe the company benefits heavily from its branding due to its security and easy-to-use interface and may be able to charge a premium for a while, just as Apple does with its products which in many instances are less powerful machines than PCs
* Second is what is called the [company’s flywheel](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603d7a786657bc8b497de52d_Network%20Effects.jpg)
   * Because customers **trust** Coinbase, the company is able to **attract** more and more customers 
   * This allows the company to **continue scaling** the company while also **adding more assets** onto the platform that customers can trade 
   * Coinbase can then **understand** their customer’s needs and **create** more innovative products that help keep customers on the platform 
   * This entire process **makes the overall platform stronger** which extends Coinbase’s leadership in the marketplace and allows the company to grow its market share 
   * To give you one concrete statistic of this flywheel taking effect, **Coinbase stated that 21% of users used a non-investing product in 2020 leading to an average net revenue increase per user of 90%**
* A third reason to be bullish on Coinbase is the **rapid growth of the crypto market** due to strong use cases and institutional trading
   * This [graphic](https://cdn.howmuch.net/articles/bitcoin-money-economy-in-perspective-7dd6.jpg) may be a bit outdated since it’s from 2018, but the point still stands. Even if the crypto market is $2.2 TN, that amount is pretty small if you believe that crypto is going to be a significant form of currency in the future. 
   * Personally, I’ve had to transfer from US banks to banks in China and Korea for my last business and the process is extremely painful and expensive
      * If you’ve ever sent money through crypto to other people, the only tricky part is figuring out the addresses to send to but other than, it’s basically instantaneous and cheap
      * As a result, it’s very easy to imagine crypto growing just based on that use case alone although there are other arguments to be made as well such as Bitcoin being a store of value
   * In addition to this, I believe a big reason the crypto market is growing so fast is because **institutions like hedge funds** which are the ones that move equity markets are rapidly joining the crypto market 
      * At just Coinbase alone, institutions grew from 1000 in 2017 to 7000 in 2020 and even Tesla recently made a $1.5 billion investment into bitcoin
      * These institutions increasingly validate crypto and a rapidly growing market will greatly benefit Coinbase
* The fourth reason to be bullish is that Coinbase has **so many more markets it can enter and assets to add**
   * The company is extremely deliberate and that’s a reason the company is so well trusted as a crypto exchange
   * Coinbase is currently ranked [2nd](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) for spot exchanges on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) and that’s pretty impressive given Coinbase is in much fewer markets and offers less coins 
      * This is because Coinbase is the number 1 exchange in the US which is where a lot of the world’s capital is in
   * But the point is, there is a lot of room for Coinbase to expand which will further expand the company’s revenue and scale

**The Bear Case**

* First is Coinbase’s dependence on the highly volatile crypto market
   * Now, everyone knows the crypto market is volatile, but the reason this is such a big issue for Coinbase is that as a public company, Coinbase now **needs to manage investor expectations every quarter**
   * As you can see here, [Coinbase’s revenue](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5defb8273d0a4ce99a0af8ee/603db84a3291d9febc0c7427_Quaterly%20Total%20Revenue.jpg) has been super lumpy over the past few years
   * What this basically means is that as an investor, you’ll need an **iron stomach** to deal with a stock price that will likely rise and fall sharply with the crypto market
* The second risk involves competition
   * Because crypto is such a lucrative industry, there is constant competition from multiple fronts
   * First, there are other crypto exchanges that provide the most direct competition and **while Coinbase is highly regulated, many non-US exchanges are not**
      * This provides non-US crypto exchanges with a competitive advantage because they are able to offer popular products and services with less regulation while still serving the US population
   * Second, are from **financial incumbents** like TD Ameritrade, Schwab, or even financial institutions like JP Morgan
      * If any of these companies start offering crypto trading then that could meaningfully take share from Coinbase
   * Third are from **fintech companies** which are already starting to see significant trading volume
      * Robinhood and Square’s CashApp are big players in the space and PayPal has also recently started to get into the mix 
   * Fourth are **decentralized trading platforms** that allow users to directly buy and sell without the need for a centralized exchange like Coinbase
      * These platforms currently are not as easy to use and aren’t as fast and liquid, but over time, the models are going to improve rapidly with Coinbase even admitting in its S-1 that the company has seen transaction volumes rivaling its own
   * So Coinbase is very well positioned especially in the US market, but **there’s a ton of competition to be wary of,** especially given Coinbase charges the highest fees and those fees are likely going to lower over time
* The third risk is mixed sentiment
   * Overall, Coinbase is generally regarded as the most trusted crypto exchange in the US, but there’s still a lot of hate the the company gets
   * On Coinbase’s subreddit, there are **constant complaints about funds being locked out and accounts not working and users seem to complain most about the lack of customer service and also the company’s high fees**
   * Every crypto exchange has its issues and Coinbase likely has to charge high fees because it’s operating in the US which is highly regulated and expensive, but, I do think Coinbase needs to vastly improve its customer service in order to maintain its customer base (there are talks the company plans to open a customer service center in India)
* The fourth risk is the lack of shareholder voting rights
   * As is the case with many tech companies these days, the **vast majority of voting rights are going to be held by a small number of Class B shareholders**
      * Class B shareholders own 99.2% of voting rights while directors, officers, and 5% shareholders own 60.5% of voting rights which puts a lot of power in the hands of the few
   * To give you an example of why this could be a problem, Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong actually took a lot of heat for recently [not allowing political and social discussions at work](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/coinbase-ceo-offers-severance-to-employees-leaving-over-politics.html)
   * Things like this and potential scandals with high level management could lead to potential unrest in the company while shaleholders really won’t have the power to do much

**So is Coinbase a Buy or Sell?**

* Sorry to leave on a bit of a cliffhanger but this requires an overview of Coinbase’s financials and some extensive thoughts on valuation, which I’ll write up later and post as soon as I can.
* In short though, I personally believe Coinbase is a buy from $250-$313 (or at least that's my target range at which I would start a position), which implies a \~$60-$80BN valuation.  Would be great to hear what you all plan to do as well.","['AAPL', 'PYPL', 'TSLA']"

mrmmk1,,investing,post,1618516360,"Short Thesis - Capital Senior Living Corporation ($CSU)Here is why I am initiating a short position in Capital Senior Living Corporation (Ticker Symbol: CSU) and why you should probably take a look into it too: 

Business:

Capital Senior Corporation, or CSU, provides senior living services to elderly population over the age of 75+. As of December of 2019, which is the date of their last annual report, they own 126 housing operations in 23 states with approximately 16,000 residents in total. The services they provide include senior living services, assisted living services, meals, healthcare, and other personal care services for the elderly. 

The company makes money by charging a monthly ""rent"" to the elderly who live in their residences. In their annual report, they mention that their residents are either in a financial position to pay for the service themselves or have family, such as children, who can provide them with the financial support to pay for this. In addition to owning multiple properties throughout the U.S, CSU also leases properties. 

Qualitative Analysis:

The qualitative reasons for the short position are quite obvious. 8 out of 10 COVID deaths reported are for people over the age of 65. This means that the target customer base for CSU has been hit the hardest. Unlike many other businesses, such as retail or hospitality, where you can argue that customers will come back once COVID subsides, you cannot make that same argument for this company. The death rate of this demographic suggests that many of CSU's customers are not going to be coming back, even post-COVID. 

The other consideration with COVID here is that people are much more likely to distrust retirement homes or senior living services moving forward. There was a massive scandal in New York City where Governor Cuomo pushed elderly people into retirement homes, only to end up killing a large portion of that population. I'm not gonna go into the political details of it, but you can read about it here: [https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/26/cuomos-nursing-home-fiasco-ethical-perils-pandemic-policymaking/)

All of this suggests that elderly people are not incentivized to go into retirement homes anytime soon. Even with the large vaccination numbers under the Biden administration, it is unlikely that the entire effects of the pandemic are going to subside anytime soon. If you are elderly and especially at risk, you are much more likely to call in for home care or some other alternatives, rather than finding yourself in a living service with other people where the chances of the virus spreading are high. 

Now there are two ways you can argue against this short position on a qualitative basis. First, if you do some research, you'll find out that CSU recently vaccinated most of its residents. However, this doesn't solve the problem that they lost most of their customers in the past year, who are never coming back. Even with the vaccination, elderly people are not going to feel confident about living in these facilities for a long time. Second, you can argue that healthcare services in the United States are getting better. This means that life expectancies are going to be higher in the future, meaning more elderly people living = better business for CSU. However, given the effects of this pandemic, we are not going to see CSU occupancy and revenue numbers return back to pre-COVID levels for a very long time. Life expectancies are probably going to remain suppressed due to COVID for a long time, and I am taking this short position with a 1-1.5 year time horizon. By the time the life expectancy rolls back, I will have exited the short with a pretty hefty return. 

Financial Analysis:

Now the quantitative and financial analysis of this company makes it even more clear why a short position is obvious. In 2018, the company's revenue dropped by 1.1%. In 2019, revenues dropped by 2.8%. In 2020, revenues dropped by almost 20%

Now let's look at net income. Since 2015, the company has not turned a single year of profit. In fact, their net income has decreased every single year. From -$14.3 million in 2015 to -$295.4 million in 2020. Even without the COVID-19 impact, this company was on a downward slope towards bankruptcy. With COVID, it seems unlikely that this company can ever do a turnaround. 

Looking at the balance sheet only confirms this thesis. As of now, the company has cash of only 17.9 million while the short-term and long-term debt of over 900 million. Even if the company liquidated all of its properties that it owns, which has a book value of roughly 928 million, the company can barely remain solvent. Add on top of this the fact that the company has been selling portions of its property to REITs in order to keep operating, you quickly realize that CSU can never reach pre-COVID 19 levels of revenue ever again. 

Add on top of this that the company's stock is up from $13 to $40 a share over the past year, you realize that something doesn't add up here. The intrinsic value of the company is far far lower than where it is trading today, giving additional conviction to my short thesis. In my opinion, CSU is one of the zombie companies that's being kept alive due to PPP and reckless spending, but soon enough, people will realize that their business model no longer works, even in a post-COVID world. 

That is all. Appreciate any feedback or thoughts.",

mrmmk1,gun9r67,investing,comment,1618518345,"Thanks for your detailed analysis of this company. I am on the other side of your trade and appreciate a good opposition. 

I think you are oversimplifying the demand component of this business. The managed care business was destroyed last year but the occupancy numbers are slowly ticking back up and will be back to normalized levels by next year. People don’t go to these facilities because they want to so the real issue was the quarantine and the lack of normal demand in the system. 

On the financial side of the equation, I think your operating revenue assumptions are also off. They got rid of the worst properties last year and most of the debt that you highlighted is long-term mortgage debt on the real estate. 

I am absolutely aware that they have some work to do but at an $85m market cap today they are easily worth 5x if they can get back on track. This is not guaranteed for sure but a great risk reward from the current price. 

Technically the chart is also disagreeing with you. Good luck in your trading (except this one).",

mrmmk1,gunvtnu,investing,comment,1618528694,"Hi, I always appreciate somebody really sharing an idea completely like this, so thanks. I have a few thoughts on this one:+ pre-covid, I was looking for long term plays in senior housing so I remember this company. I didn't think it looked like a turnaround was coming up soon and passed it by.+ having a ridiculous rally recently doesn't mean anything on its own for any stock. It just got back to it's pre-crash levels. Since it was headed down pre-crash, maybe that does make for a good short entry, but I'd still thinking of it has having come DOWN to the low 40s.- I think your thesis about the loss of old folks is unlikely to hold up. Sure, we lost a bunch of them, but there were already too many.  People are on waiting lists for years, even decades, to get into senior housing. And, we all know that housing in general has a serious supply problem that isn't going away soon.- I guess I'd say compare its fundamentals to peers and base things on that, but also no reason to start a short against short-term momentum either, so now doesn't seem like the time.",
mrepwx,,investing,post,1618493482,"Discovery Inc. long term streaming caseDiscovery Inc. recently got involved with a overleveraged Archegos fund which caused the stock to crash 50%+ as banks dumped shares. Some could make the case that the stock got artificially pushed up/ inflated.

However I see this as an opportunity to get in to a company earning **2B positive cashflow** every year and 10 billion of revenue vs Netflix's 23 B\*. They should have the cashflow to pay off their debt but still **15B in debt** is a lot so this is a downside.

The company currently operates in 220 countries  with over 300K hours of content, producing lots more every year. They own the Oprah show, animal planet , food network..

Comparing Discovery to Netflix makes a compelling case, valued at 5% of the market cap of Netflix (240B) vs (20B) and with a competing content offering with the goal to recreate the Netflix like- online subscriber business model justifies thinking about the possibility for decent returns on investment.

***CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels*** *in march 2020 : "" ""We really don't need a crazy number of subscribers to be operating a profitable business here.""*

May 10th they will anounce quarter results and have an investor call.

Summary:

Disney streaming, Apple , Netflix, Amazon : I believe online streaming is the way of the future instead of cable TV, if Discovery can convert their business towards the new online subscription model I believe they have a good chance of winning a decent % of the streaming market due to their huge library of content.

mrepwx,guny7b8,investing,comment,1618529894,"I think DISCA might be or in the near future be undervalued due to the dump and shorts. If you're willing to hold out then it could make you some money assuming it progresses normally.

My problem with DISCA lies in a few issues:

1. I think streaming will keep growing, but likely to see downturn post-covid.

2. Restriction of content and no benefit from reopening due to it lacking a movie studio or movie production line. T has Warner. NFLX is buying up studios left and right and recently started winning awards. VIAC has Paramount. Amazon has it's in house studio and can literally buy a studio if it wanted. 

3. It would be incorrect to assume that DISCA's previous highs are a guarantee of future highs or even return to those highs. It (along with VIAC) was runned up and pump by Archegos.

4. DISCA doesn't have other business arms to keep it fighting if the streaming war continues into a battle of attrition or if a sudden price-cutting war breaks out. T brings in tons of money from mobile, internet/phone lines, trad TV, and WarnerMedia that does movies. AMZN is a company that will be around for 100 years and it's making money on everything. NFLX is the incumbent and investors gives it the benefit of the doubt as a tech company and will keep buying even if it loses money every year (unlike DISCA). VIAC has a movie studio and a host of news outlets. DIS has a multiple media empire, MCU owns the movies, has theme parks, owns HULU, and sells toys to kids. Alphabet's youtube is already cash positive and will never go away. Comcast is like T and does telecommunications, movies, and news.

5. All these companies can package their stuff with other things. I get HBOMax free with my internet from T. I've been getting NFLX for $2/month with my T-mobile plan for years now. NFLX is the most popular subscription packaged with other subscriptions that people already use. AMEX Gold and higher cards get it for free. DIS+ is the 2nd most population ""added"" free subscription. AMZN gives it's streaming free as a bonus to prime shipping membership. Comcast gives it's for free with it's telecom offerings. ***What does DISCA package it's streaming with so that it's FREE?***

6. Average number of streaming services a person/family will have is 1-3. Very few will go past 4 or even 5. Now think about where DISCA will fit when [DIS, NFLX, and AMZN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_services) are there locking up the top 3. Youtube is always free with streaming as a plus. It's left to fight for the scraps among Hulu, HBOMax, Peacock, Viacom, and AppleTV & other lesser rivals.

7. Content. I don't think Discovery even has the advantage on content. [NFLX/DIS/T/VIAC all beat it in content.](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/ranking-best-original-content-streaming)

8. Moat. There's no moat in the industry. If there was one then it's NFLX's name and the ability to package other services which I mentioned in 5. We're already oversaturated BEFORE factoring new entrants both in the states, Europe, and China.

I won't tell you to NOT buy DISCA. I just think it's a small fish in a crowded and ever-tightening pool of sharks. I've been in GOOG and T for years. The only reason I don't sell T is because I'm just pocketing dividends of the TELECOM company I bought. Not for the streaming. If I were to do some pickup I'd take VIAC over DISCA. 

I am also interested on your opinion on my assessment.","['VIAC', 'AMZN', 'DIS', 'GOOGL', 'DISCA', 'CMCSA', 'NFLX']"

Go to hour 9 minute 30 for his spiel as all the information is pulled from his testimony. Ticker is CRK .

Source: [https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view\_id=49&clip\_id=15395](https://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=49&clip_id=15395)

Facts:

500 Million Cubic Feet of Natty Gas a day for five days at $55 on average spot during the storm.

500MMcF = 500,000 BTU.

500,000 BTU \*55 \* 5 = $137,500,000 in revenue in five days.

The 500MCF amount checks out as that's about a third of their daily production which is what would be available to take advantage of the spot prices as about 60-66% of their production is contracted out at a given time.

Giving their working interest is about 82%... the well royalties would be about 18% so they should get 82% of 137.5M or 112.75M. Now the cost of getting the gas to Texas during the storm were higher but I am willing to say they were not more than 1M a day... so thinking they walked away with about 107.75M in 5 days. Given they would have normally sold at around $3 per BTU at the time the extra NI is likely at least 107.75M - (500,000 \*3\*5) = 100.25M.

Now the company has already started to leverage the storm windfall to refinance its debt at a cheaper interest rate and at a longer maturity and the extra cash inflow from this quarter will serve to strengthen their position. Their slide deck says savings of 45M in interest expense already. Bankers already started giving them cheaper debt immediately after the storm. So its likely the company will only continue to cut down its interest expense with this additional cash flow... which further supports the share price.

Fully Diluted Share Count \~215,000,000 so 45M in savings in annual interest they already have disclosed = further 21 cents per share in earnings (just from less interest on same amount of debt aka refinancing).

Street still has earnings at 12 cents per share for Q1 2021. They are asleep at the wheel and likely never sat through 9.5 hours of senate hearings on the 26th of February. Thinking the real numbers, all else equal, will be north of 50 cents for Q1 2021 alone. This is high for a company that is only trading at $5.00 a share. If it gets 50 cents Q1 and what the street lazily thinks of 15 cents on average for the next three quarters... 2021 is going to end up with 95 cents per share... on a $5 share price if we add the locked in interest savings that is 1.16 cents per share. This gives the company an estimated P/E of 4.3x... This is multibagger territory and the company already has most of its production hedged over 2.50 so the risk of shortfall in Q2/Q3/Q4 is mitigated if Nat Gas revisits the covid panic.

Going to buy options around Q1 earnings date (May 4th, 2021). May the Fourth be with us research monkeys! :)",['NI']

Related party transactions and acquisitions have been a matter of habit for the Alibaba Partnership. In April 2014, Alibaba gave Simon Xie a $1 billion loan which he used to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media5 through an entity that was jointly owned by Jack Ma and Simon Xie. Alibaba claimed that they were not able to invest in Wasu Media directly because of Chinese regulations and that investing through Mr. Xie’s entity was the only way. In fact, Alibaba has regularly invested alongside Yunfeng Capital, a Shanghai based private equity company that was established by Jack Ma in 2010. The list of such related party transactions runs long and as recently as 2019 Alibaba Pictures gave a $103 million loan to struggling film studio Huayi Brothers Media in which Jack Ma has a considerable stake6. The lines between Alibaba’s shareholder interests and Jack Ma’s personal interests are very blurry, and at odds with our philosophy of backing clean and well aligned ownership structures.

Since Alibaba’s IPO, the asset base has grown tenfold from $18 billion to $185 billion or 48% per year.

However, this asset growth has mostly been driven by acquisitions and self-reported asset revaluations. Between 2014 and 2020, Alibaba has expanded their balance sheet by $92 billion in relation to equity investments (incl. goodwill recognised). In the same period, the ROAs have dropped from 26% to 13% and ROIC has fallen from 33% to 8%.

Alibaba management justifies these acquisitions saying that they are linked to the building of a digital ecosystem. However, most of the businesses don’t make any money (eating up most of the core business’ free cashflow) and claims around strengthening the ecosystem often seem tenuous. For example, in 2015, Alibaba invested $590 million into Meizu, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, which besides having nothing to do with Alibaba’s core business also meant entry into a highly competitive space. A now struggling Meizu needed a financial bailout from the government in 20197. Alibaba Pictures Group, which began in 2014 as a 60% stake in ChinaVision Group, has been another sinkhole of capital for Alibaba shareholders. The company has accumulated $500 million in losses, after four years in the red8.

Some of these acquisitions are in fact so outlandish that Alibaba’s management team cannot claim synergistic benefits for the core business. Consider South China Morning Post, where Joseph Tsai was explicit about needing to control the narrative presented on China9. Or the $192 million purchase of 50% of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which appears to be a vanity project10.",

Maybe, I don't have the full picture but it seems their products are only ""put a cool UI and automate some data tasks"".

All  the things I saw in their presentation are perfectly manageable if you  hire proper IT people. We don't need UI to prepare data from different  sources, link the data, run AI models etc. We can do it in days or weeks  not years like they are trying to sell you.

Maybe they will faciliate some tasks for companies without good sized or skilled IT teams, I dont' know...

Their  UI seems very interesting and well designed, I can give that. But I m  sure we will be quicker with a simple linux terminal (joke) :)

I  see their products like ""Channable"" for data flow management but with  all the AI hype (\*\*Channable is a small tool to prepare data to be sent  to shopping marketplaces).

Like I  said, maybe I don't have the full picture based on their presentation  and I don't know any figures related to their valuation etc. But for a  pure technical point, I don't see anything in the core plateform that is  a big whaooo effect (except their UI).

If  I need to think about a road : they maybe will be a 3d engine like  Unreal Engine or Unity but for data linking, preparation, and IA models  (the tool that groups up the techs in a simpler way).. but I have a  doubt.

Just a single (and possibly uninformed) perspective, but that has not been my experience working at a f100 financial services firm. We have multiple complex proprietary processing systems that we've spent tens of millions on, multiple large-scale data warehouse (each with thousands if not tens of thousands of tables), and a whole supporting cast of upstream, intermediate, and reporting systems. These systems are diverse, some proprietary, some purchased, and they have been stood up over decades. It takes our IT group many months to create or even modify integration between legacy systems. We have a small army of IT folks and have thrown an awful lot of cash at several top-tier consulting groups and none have had a magic bullet. Every RFP response promises nirvana, and all scale expectations once they open the hood understand the scale of our data issues.   

If these guys have a way to efficiently unify/link and homogenize diverse datasets, it is a very big deal and worth alot of money. Especially if they have found a way to structure unstructured data effectively, as they claim.

Apple plans to unveil a new iPad Pro line as early as this month, Bloomberg News [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost) recently. The company has also been working on several other products, including an accessory dubbed AirTags for tracking physical devices and new iMac desktops.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the event will be online and streamed via Apple’s website. This will be Apple’s fifth virtual keynote, following last year’s developer conference and separate events for the latest Apple Watch, iPhone 12 and first Macs with Apple’s own M1 processors. Apple is holding its second virtual developer conference in early June, the company said last month.

The new iPad Pros will come in the same 11-inch and 12.9 inch screen sizes as the current models, but will add processors on par with the latest Mac chips, a new MiniLED screen on the larger model, updated cameras, and potentially an upgraded connector for faster syncing of data and compatibility with additional external monitors and storage drives.

The larger iPad Pro has been facing production issues due to the new screen technology and may initially be in short supply, Bloomberg News recently [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display).

The iPad generated $8.4 billion in revenue for Apple during the key holiday quarter of 2020, the most since 2014. Sales jumped on demand from people working and studying from home during the pandemic. As employees and students begin returning to offices and schools in coming months, Apple will be betting on the new iPad models to maintain interest in the tablet line.

At the event, Apple is also likely to announce the release date of iOS 14.5, an upcoming software update that will introduce new privacy protections for ad tracking across apps and websites. The update has irked companies like Facebook Inc., which has said the changes could hurt its advertising business.","['AAPL', 'FB', 'TWTR']"

mr23mr,,investing,post,1618440740,"My attempt at EBITDA forecast valuation for Tesla (TSLA)So I've tried to estimate the 10-year return for holding TSLA shares by projecting growth, margins and EBITDA forward in three scenarios and coming up with an estimated enterprise value and market cap for TSLA in 2030. Hoping to hear some helpful feedback.

Quick disclaimer: I am not a CFA, I don't have a degree in finance (degree in engineering) and this is my first time trying to do this. Obviously don't take this as investment advice.

For the base case scenario, I used analyst estimates for revenue growth in 2021-2023 and then grew it at the rate closer to the projected EV market growth between now and 2027 (22%). I then grew it at 20% for the last 3 years to be conservative. So this is a scenario in which Tesla captures more market share for a few years and then maintains that market share. For EBITDA Margin, I maintained it at 20% until 2026 at which point I let it decline by 1 percentage point a year as I'd expect there to be more competition and Tesla to be selling less luxury cars (higher margin) as a percentage of their sales. 

My base case EBITDA projection for 2030 was then 48.45 Billion USD. For a company that is still growing revenues at 20% albeit without high margins, I gave it a EV/EBITDA multiple of 25, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 1.2 Trillion dollars. This represents a 1.66x multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the bull/optimistic case, I kept the margin at 20% for the next 10 years and kept the growth rate above the 22% market rate for the next 10 years, meaning Tesla is able to maintain their higher than industry margins, perhaps through leasing autopilot software and continues to gain market share. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 77.26 Billion USD. With it's continued higher growth rate, I gave it an EV/EBITDA multiple of 30, resulting in an enterprise value and market cap of 2.3 Trillion dollars. This represents a 3.18 multiple over 10 years on the original investment.

For the more pessimistic case, I reduced the growth rate slightly below analyst projections for 2021-2023 and brought down the growth rate to 18% by 2030. I also brought the EBITDA margin down to 15% by 2030. This gave me an 2030 EBITDA of 44.11 Billion USD. With it's lower growth rate, I gave it a lower EV/EBITDA multiple of 20 giving Tesla an enterprise value of 882 Billion USD. This represents a 1.21x multiple on the original investment.

I gave each of the scenarios a weight--base case: 50%, bull case 30%, and bear case 20%. I'm optimistic on the EV market overall so I wanted to give the bull case a slight advantage. This resulted in a weighted multiple on investment of 2.03x, which represents an 8% annualized rate of return. I found this to be surprising/more bullish than I was expecting, but I would still not invest in Tesla as it does not fit my desired risk/reward profile.

What do you all think? How can I improve my analysis? Is there something about Tesla that would make one of these cases more or less likely?",['TSLA']

mquayi,,investing,post,1618417918,"Updated Paysafe DD: Medium to long term hold.Paysafe  offers a unique combination of fintech, crypto, iGaming, sports betting  and banking all rolled into one stock.  This is why NBC’s Cramer  recently said, “There is something about Paysafe that may be the  ultimate stock for this moment.” Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso  calls for $45-50 saying, “It’s the most excited I’ve been about a stock  in a long time.” So why is that?

Updated DD:

Partnered  with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch,  Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming,  etc.

Global electronic payment  platform with integrated cloud technology offering migration of eCash,  integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into  global banking as a service (with proprietary risk management enabling  mobile e-commerce for the 1.7 billion ”unbanked.”)

$58  trillion TAM.  Fund manager Cathie Wood: “Fintechs are going to gut  banks.” Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve predicts a  “$16 trillion market cap wholesale transition” of fintechs “taking over  and revolutionizing banking”

No. 1  global leader in iGaming eCash network. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market  volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected  to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

No.  2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. Owns Neteller  and Skrill, winner “Best Digital Wallet” for “best consumer take up”,  “most innovative technology” with “greatest potential to disrupt current  ecosystems.”

No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing

Enabled for crypto-to-crypto trading (Bitcoin & 26 other crypto-currencies)

Winner “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Rapidly  expanding in US with new partnerships (last 3 months: Coinbase,  Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto) & new  legalized sports betting (this month: NY, WY, NH)

Trustpilot  in Europe (where more commonly used) rates Paysafe as “Excellent”  (4.7/5 stars) with over 24,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""poor"" (1.2/5  stars) with over 17,000 reviews.

Bill  Foley, Paysafe's Chairman of the Board, has a proven track record in  generating rapid synergistic inorganic growth. Over the last five years  Foley has grow Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X  ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS  from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those  characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with  Paysafe.”

Foley on Paysafe: “It’s  a fortress. It’s got a moat…We have a proven strategy of winning as new  global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory  risk and technical expertise…It’s going to be a land grab…I have a  vision that we should be THE digital wallet… It’s our job to be there  first and to make sure we dominate. We’re focusing on gaming,  particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and  we’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting.”

Analyst  coverage: “We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within  the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical  footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply  revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe  there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level  legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a  unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and  offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential  legalization of iGaming in the United States.""

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&#x200B;

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

&#x200B;

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections
2. From  published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,  bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.  Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to  fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected  10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

Recent signals of Blackstone/CVC’s long-term hold beyond lockup expiration:

Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler : “We believe  Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a  public company.”

SEC filed FTAC’s Board of  Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination:  “Commitment of Paysafe’s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC  Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect  stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the  post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such  stockholders’ belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects  of Paysafe going forward.”

&#x200B;

Edit:  Looking for the bear case to justify recent price action but it becomes very hard to do when Paysafe has substantially positive free cash flow at $362 million, healthy revenue growth, and strong EBITDA growth.

Even looking at a basket of the poorest performing fintechs with much slower revenue growth or even negative revenue growth, negative EBITDA and negative cash flow, the lowest possible average of that basket of multiples would put Paysafe’s share price at $15.43. There is no reasonable way to argue that Paysafe is worth even that little.

For example:

Paysign has negative revenue growth (-30.4%), negative EBITDA margin and  negative EBITDA growth, and yet it trades at a higher EV/REV multiple of 8.5X. This would put Paysafe 15% higher at $15.20.

Shift4 reported only 4.8% y-o-y rev growth, with negative  cash flow, negative EBITDA growth and much higher debt to equity but it  still trades at EV/REV of 10.6x. This puts Paysafe SP at $18.88.

Shift4's EV/EBITDA multiple of 51.56X would put Paysafe SP at $31.29.

Also, initial analyst valuations have not taken into account ongoing developments in US iGaming where ""roughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe.""

Recent headlines show Paysafe's iGaming growth plan is right on track:

1. ""Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting""
2. ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""
3. ""Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting""
4. ""Wyoming Legalizes Crypto Use for Online Sports Betting""
5. ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""
6. New Hampshire: ""Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan  likely to sign""
7. ""Caesars Entertainment announced Official Sports Betting Partner of  NFL"" (partnered with Paysafe)

The above developments have been excluded from Paysafe's growth projections and one analyst indicated that this is the exact type of traction that would cause him to upgrade his $19 price target, saying: ""we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.""

If you want more risk-adjusted return, equal weighting doesn't give you adequate exposure to the size factor.

You need a small-cap fund that filters out small-cap growth stocks, because historically they actually have a negative total return. You want a small-cap value fund ideally.

If the case for equal weighting is that you don't like FAANG and think tech is overvalued/the next tech bubble is about to burst, well, if you hold VTI and VXUS you're diversified, and that's the best you can do fundamentally. Otherwise you are moving into the realm of investor ""tastes"", which also doesn't have a good risk-adjusted return rate.",

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

Multiples:

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

mqy9tn,,investing,post,1618429220,"Vicinity Motor Corp/Grande West Transportation TSXV: $VMC OTC: $BUSXD - Significantly undervalued with amazing growth opportunities ahead Hello Everyone,

Currently   the largest holding in my portfolio is Vicinity Motor Corp, you may   have heard of them previously as Grande West Transportation, but they   recently went through a name change to reflect what they do/closer   mirror the name of their buses. [https://ir.grandewest.com/](https://ir.grandewest.com/)

So   Vicinity Motor corp makes Buses - CNG, Diesel and Electric.  They are a   Canadian bus manufacturer who is now breaking into the US market and I   think they are posed for a breakout this year and into next year.

I'll   start with giving some of the business moves that makes me extremely   confident with them and then move into financials and finish with risks   to the company

**Business Moves for 2021**

Vicinity   is looking to break into the American market - they have a plant in   Washington state which is projected to be finished by Q4 of 2021 that is   buy America compliant.  They also have signed a deal with ABC  companies  to distribute their buses and through that have roughly $15  million of  deals that have been signed for the second half of 2021.

They   have signed deals with both New Mexico and the State of Washington to   be an OEM supplier for the transit agencies for those states - both are   statewide contracts.  These deals do not make them an exclusive   supplier, but rather give the transit agencies the ability to buy their   buses from Vicinity.  If they can just get a fraction of these sales   then that will translate to a huge improvement in the revenue for the   company. They also mentioned in [This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTQTt6calg&t=454s&ab_channel=SmallcapDiscoveries)   that they are progressing in signing a deal with the state of   California, if signed that would be massive - they somewhat go through   the math, but it looks like the total deal would be up to 2.4 billion in   buses - obviously they wouldn't capture all of that, but if they get a   portion of that along with Washington and New Mexico, it would be   massive.

Now the next big thing   they are doing is making electric buses.  At the moment, they do not   have any electric buses on the road. They are anticipating getting their   first 5 electric buses in June and will use them to Demo to potential   customers and run testing on to make sure that they are good and have  no  issues.  Note that the last time they had Altoona testing done on  their  buses they received best in class.

Lastly,   they are in a good position to capture both the Canadian and US   green/infrastructure bills. These are massive amounts of capital flowing   to bus companies and transit organizations - definitely a boon to the   company/the industry as a whole.

**Financials:**

The   company has a couple of items on the financials that makes me very   bullish and a couple of forward looking items from their recent earnings   call which makes me very excited.

Starting   with the Forward looking items - they have said they are going to have   roughly $50 Million of revenue in the first half of 2021.  That is   roughly double of the revenue in both 2019 and 2020.  I had mentioned   earlier that they have at least an additional $15 Million booked for   Q3/Q4 of this year.  Bringing up their booked revenue to $65 Million as   of April - and those do not include any money from the deals with   Washington and New Mexico. They also received an order for [5 electric buses from Tulane University](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/02/tulane-university-buys-5-vicinity-electric-shuttle-buses/) That would bring them up to most likely about 66.5 Million in revenue for the year that is booked through April.

Now,   before the Q4 earnings were reported, I had one major worry with the   company - their cost of revenue.  I had listened to their Q3 earnings   call and heard that their gross margins would improve due to them   getting out of a deal where they were selling their buses for a   discount.  I wanted to see the impact of this and it was honestly pretty   staggering.  [Here are the Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BUSXD/financials?p=BUSXD)   now the Q4 gross margin includes an impairment of .7 Million. so I   threw that out to get a look at what forward gross margins would be and I   got 33.2%. That is roughly a 5-6X improvement over the previous   quarters - Q3 had a gross profit of 6.3% and 5.7% in Q2.  This is where   the real growth comes in for me - they not only are going to double   their revenue from the previous year in the first half of this year, it   is going to be at much better margins.  Now that would still have them   trading at a fairly generous amount to their forward EBITDA - roughly   about 20X but growing revenue by at least 2.5X YoY and then improving   gross margins by 5-6X makes me think they are still very undervalued -   especially with the incoming catalysts of a NASDAQ uplisting and their   electric buses hitting the market/the market realizing they make green   vehicles.

**Risks:**

* Currently,   it looks like the $50 million in revenue is from a single customer -  at  least that is how I interpret it although that could be incorrect,  so  they will need to work on building relationships with other entities  as  this order and revenue from it dries up.

mq3sz8,,investing,post,1618325413,"Guide to bitcoin mining stocksWith Coinbase bringing tons of attention and looking like it will have a sky high valuation many are going to be looking for cheaper c****o stocks. 

Mining stocks produce leveraged returns over the underlying asset, whether it's gold, silver, or bitcoin. 

* You are buying the profit (variable) minus costs (fixed). 

* Say it costs $10 to mine $11 worth of bitcoin/gold. That's $1 (10%) profit. 

* The asset doubles in price to $22 (+100%). Profit is $11 (+1100%).

Evaluating miners can be daunting at first but they're actually very simple [quantifiable](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/3/12/49782598-16155711719714544_origin.png) operations with very little guesswork. By looking at [current](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176481499887147_origin.png) and [future](https://imgur.com/a/FS884xP) hashrate, electricity costs, and saved bitcoin we can value these companies with high precision at specific bitcoin price points. 

There are two ways to value these stocks. Based on [current hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176654693896902_origin.png) or [projected hashrate](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2021/4/5/49782598-16176645878387735_origin.png). Their proper value probably lies somewhere in between. 

With a very very modest 25PE (miners and hot tech stocks often go into the 100's) and bitcoin $100k (lower than most institutional estimates) we can calculate a [3.5-5.1x potential](https://imgur.com/w7uvlo5). 

Miners are a leveraged play on bitcoin like gold miners on gold. Their profit is the difference between the price floor to mine and price of bitcoin. Profitability data can be tracked [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y). 

Unlike leveraged bitcoin you can't be washed out. Unlike altc*ins you don't risk picking the wrong blockchain. They combine the upside of altc*ins with the inevitability of bitcoin but somehow get the least attention. This of course also means they are more volatile than bitcoin so you need an iron stomach. 

The public miners are in a race to secure hashrate and cheap power. With announced purchases we can calculate their [income](https://imgur.com/W2gRL0K).

Miners are incentivized to [h*dl bitcoin](https://imgur.com/61rSlV9) and in some cases outright buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. This further increases price appreciation when bitcoin moves for the stocks with a high h*dl. 

Mara and Riot have the highest market caps being on Nasdaq. However, the pre-Nasdaq stocks' [market caps](https://imgur.com/aKzj0PG) are far behind what their hashrate should be valued. There are some massive [price dislocations](https://imgur.com/P9qxdCx) going on because of the Nasdaq barrier. 

[Blonity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJvLknI9JEwW_p4m8xaAow) is a great analyst in the sector and has created an all in one [BMXI indicator](https://imgur.com/V3wWOtS) which calculates the degree of undervalue of each stock based on these hashrate-to-marketcap discrepancies. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuzv_eMtviCHnWJ9Irn-nqslzD1XV5xsY) explains in more detail how the indicators work. Note: DGHI & DMGI are new smallcap miners that were recently added and have less history than the rest and I wouldn't recommend making them a main position. 

A Nasdaq uplisting could be explosive for the OTC miners. However, Mara and Riot may outperform in the short term due to better accessibility. In the long term Mara has the most future hashrate secured and will dominate the scene. My strategy is to hold mostly OTC miners now then roll into the Nasdaq miners after the value gaps close. 

The biggest concern about miners (and what previous DDs here got wrong) is that mining is intensely competitive with little moat and they will lose marketshare as global hashpower ramps up. This is unfounded for multiple reasons. 

1. Asics and cheap megawatt energy & facilities are in short supply and they have bought up large shares for months to years into the future. Backlogs are huge.  
1. Bitcoin's price and mining profitability has always appreciated [faster](https://imgur.com/0E73cNv) than the hashrate & difficulty so it's not an issue in the next year 
1. Public money should give them a growth advantage and I asked Blonity to test this hypothesis and indeed they are gobbling up [marketshare](https://imgur.com/rj0yW27).

These companies are also branching out. Argo has purchased a staking company, Hive & Hut8 do some GPU mining which can be used for AI/Rendering computation, some are buying bitcoin like Microstrategy, etc. They will evolve into general blockchain and data companies. 

We can [calculate](https://imgur.com/poG6ZP3) how many times their share price could multiply at $200k bitcoin at various PE ratios. Hot tech companies can have PE's in the 100's. They're currently trading around 3-4.

This is the most asymmetric trade I've ever seen if you are bullish on bitcoin. With Coinbase around the corner I think these companies are going to get a lot of attention soon and the quiet pre-Nasdaq miners could have quite a run.

Another great way to hold these is the [BLOK ETF](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html). It has surprisingly good holdings with all the pre-Nasdaq miners represented in the top 10 and I highly recommend it. It has some good exchanges and straight bitcoin funds as well and they will be [adding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKE1tAyCSyo) COIN.

It assumes that after the asset price doubling (from $11 to $22), the costs to mine the same quantity of bitcoin stays constant. This may be approximately true with gold. But with bitcoin, the difficulty of mining scales with the number of miners, which in turn scales with the price of the asset to maintain an equilibrium.

So in actuality, after the asset price doubling, it is much more likely to cost $20 to mine $22 worth of bitcoin. Profit margin stays the same as just buying and holding the asset.",

mq6e0u,guf9wli,investing,comment,1618353614,"So this is oversimplified to the point of probably being inflammatory, but here I go:

Firstly, our entire economy, not just the stock market, is predicated on the assumption that growth can and must continue infinitely. All credit and lending is based on the ideal that the supply of money will grow, allowing borrowers to pay off loans with interest and still come out ahead. The stock market's pyramid-ish tendencies are therefore not a risk unique to the stock market.

Secondly, it's my opinion that the U.S. government, and the corporations it is beholden to, are simply never going to let the stock market crash long-term if they can do anything at all to prevent it. That doesn't mean the bull market is infinite, but it means that on a long enough time horizon there are only two possible things that will follow a massive crash:

1) Investors who were properly diversified, and who have the time, cash buffer, and fortitude to hold and ride out the crash will eventually regain the value they lost (which was only ever lost on paper), and investors who have capital on hand to keep buying will make even more profit. 

2) The stock market never recovers, which can only mean the U.S. government as we know it has essentially collapsed, and at that point the fact that your portfolio is worth nothing is probably not your biggest concern.

Historically recessions facilitate more transfer of wealth from the poor to the wealthy, because even though the wealthiest lose the most during a recession initially, the effect is temporary and they still have enough liquid capital on hand to buy up a bunch of assets at a discount from sellers who are hard pressed enough for short-term cash to sell at a loss. 

Bottom line, here's the secret to success: Diversify your investments, increase your cash allocation as you approach an age where you may not have the luxury of waiting for a recovery to play out, buy assets during recessions if you can, and hope that the government doesn't allow income inequality to get bad enough that the guillotines come out.",

mqbkui,,investing,post,1618347954,"A very bullish DD on $APD, a stock with good earnings, and a huge future of growthI've been looking into Hydrogen for quite a while, especially more recently with the hit its taken, but the more I've looked into it, the more I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

I think hydrogen has a better future than EV. Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. It's always been the fuel of the future, the issue is with making it safe to store. $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

Suppose hydrogen never took off as a fuel supply for transport. What are other uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (I'm not too informed on these, but here's what wikipedia has to say for those interested: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

In case you're not convinced yet, lets take a look at their competitors. LINDE PLC is the the leader by market cap, with revenues of $27.24 billion annually. APD have a YOY revenue of $8.86 Billion. However, take a look at net income. Despite only making $8.86 Billion, they have a net income of $1.9 billion (a profit margin of 21.5%),while Linde have a net income of $2.5 billion (profit margin of 9%). What makes APD even better is that they have been steadily increasing their YOY profit margin. Linde rocks a P/E ratio of about 60. I think it isn't crazy to put a similar price target on APD, which would essentially double their share price. Even on a bearish case, I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to put such a prediction for this pricetag over the next 2-3 years. 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but they have far more room to grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it. There is certainly a bit of speculation here, but each projected market quote was taken from a reputable source.","['LIN', 'APD']"

It's a big chicken egg game; hydrogen producers won't create refueling stations (which are significantly more expensive than gas or electric stations) without sufficient volume of vehicles, and consumers won't buy hydrogen vehicles of there's no infrastructure and convenience.

mpmggo,,investing,post,1618258901,"Young people stand to make dismal returns on their investments — EconomistFrom Credit Suisse’s latest global investment returns yearbook, Generation Z’s earnings from stocks and bonds will be significantly lower than those of previous generations.

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/15/young-people-stand-to-make-dismal-returns-on-their-investments

“They estimate that baby-boomers (defined here as those born 1946–64), Generation X (born 1965–80) and Millennials (born 1981–96) have all earned average real returns of at least 5% on equities and at least 3.6% on bonds. The authors then forecast what Generation Z might expect to earn in the coming decades. To do this, they assume that the real return on equities will be equal to the inflation-adjusted return on a risk-free asset (represented by Treasury bills), which they estimate at -0.5%, plus a “risk premium” for buying equities of about 3.5%, for a real return of just 3%. For bonds, the authors assume the current, negative real yields on the index-linked variety. All of this adds up to annualised returns for Gen Z of a mere 2% on a 70:30 portfolio of stocks and bonds—not even a third of the historical return of the baby boomers (see chart). These guesses could prove too pessimistic, but perhaps not dramatically so.”

mqfk8l,,investing,post,1618361081,"Let's Clear Some Things Up About Zom . . .A few key panics I'm seeing online. And just a quick response to others I've seen talk about insider trading. 



1. Company Insiders are selling. 

True 

Yup, they are. And they will continue for the rest of this company's life. They will also eventually buy some as well. It gets scheduled quarterly. It's how companies work. Even Apple. Even Telsa. 

But, something you need to understand was this has been planned since the beginning of February. Its common. 

Here is that form from Feburary... 

https://investors.zomedica.com/node/8536/html 

Here is the website to look at all the Form 4's from today. Note the bottom green wording about Rule 10b5. 

https://investors.zomedica.com/sec-filings 

Here is that rule.. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp 

To conclude, this was just coincidence that they planned to sell their shares while we are in the middle of pretty ruthless selloff . They planned this months ago. I'm sure they were hoping for more but weren't we all. If they really were scammy, I'm sure Cohen could have put out some PR right before today to jump the price of his employees, but they didn't. 

2. Cartridges were sold out? 

Maybe. 

We can't confirm as to why they were off the Miller website yesterday. But, as of this afternoon, they are back. Would be very Bullish if they sold out though. Although maybe someone can confirm, wasn't there 5 of them? Now I only see 3 back so far. 

https://millervet.shop/catalogsearch/result/?q=Truforma+


3. Institutions are selling. 

False. 

Don't get me wrong, Institutions buy and sell all the time but from the discrepancy from the Fintel and Nasdaq, it seems like institutional buying is increasing especially at these prices. Somewhat hard to tell though because they only are required to report quarterly. 

https://fintel.io/so/us/zom 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/zom/institutional-holdings


4. A reverse split is imminent. 

False. 

A bear favorite. It would need to get approved by shareholders, and for which it has been voted against twice. However, a share buyback was approved and will likely happen at some point. The details are not completely clear as to when, but the cheaper the share the more likely the buyback. 



At the end of the day, this period can suck. That said, everyone was begging for these prices again a month ago. Well here we are. Don't get twisted, no one knows where this is headed, it clearly seems manipulated by something stronger than retail buyers. Dropping 5-10% and barcoding for the rest of the day is not normal stock behavior. Because of that, I dont really think this has a floor anywhere in particular. It will be whenever the shorts change their narrative. 


This isn't some post to convince you to buy Zom. I just think there is alot of negative sentiment and misleading information out there. For now, make your own decisions about Zomedica. Nothing about this company has changed other than they are guaranteed revenue for the first time. 

Not financial advice but you already knew that.

This is a nano company that has about 20 employees currently with nearly a 1Bn market cap. The TTM revenue is zero and they have missed earnings estimates for past 4 months. How is the current stock price not based on hype? 

It looks like they have about 60M in working capital with little debt and their annual burn rate is only around 16M so they shouldn't have to raise more money in the short term - which is about the only good thing about this company.

1. I'm 31 years old, live in Russia - which has an effect on whole situation.
2. I work as developer. My monthly income is about 1400$, but I hope it will increase as it has been increasing before.
3. My main short-term objective is to save money, and buy a bigger house/apartment after 5-6 years.
4. I have some individual stocks right now: 2 AAPL, 1 ENPH, 2 XOM, 1 MSFT, 1 NEE, 2 PLTR, 1 TSM, 2 UAL, 1 DIS.

&#x200B;

The whole situation with my country makes any saving in local currency a joke. Even housing is not worth. In fact, with my current stocks I'm down 1% in general, but up 4% in my local currency.

There are sanctions on horizon, any time my president could do any shit, which would worsen situation for all the folks. So, I've chosen investing in world (not local) companies.

As a Russian resident I can't easily get access to a foreign broker. So, I'm pretty limited in available stocks and ETFs. My current broker is one of the 3 major Russian banks.

&#x200B;

**ETF or individual stocks?**

Maybe I should buy some ETFs, but again, which ones? There are not so much available for me - most of them are ruled by Russian banks. And I'm afraid they could collapse after sanctions or some other shit.

The only one which is semi-international is FinEx: FXUS, FXDE, FXWO and so on.

With individual stocks I'm more confident, because I'm an shareholder and present in all the required registries. So, I could restore access to my shares if something happens.

The price is less profit compared to ETF and more time spent on tracking companies.

&#x200B;

My current plan is to buy individual stocks regularly. I would chose companies from S&P500 and add some less reliable like ENPH, PLTR.

Short term plan is to buy: little oil (XOM), some cruise (like Carnival), more green energy (NEE), add no-tech companies like Walmart, McDonald's, Procter&Gamble. Also I was thinking about LHA.

So, I would like to diversify, but be more tech.","['XOM', 'CCL', 'AAPL', 'NEE', 'WMT', 'ENPH', 'MSFT', 'SPGI', 'DIS', 'UAL', 'MCD']"

**The Fundamentals**

Canoo(GOEV) is an electric car company, what makes them unique is the modular electric platform that their vehicles are built on. The modular electric platform appears to have all of the necessary equipment on it for the car to be able to run. This allows Canoo to make cars with more interior space as they do not need an engine in the front or back of the car. Their self claimed goal with this is to allow customers and businesses to use their vehicles in many different ways. Canoo is planning to launch its first consumer vehicle in 2022. Canoo is based in Los Angeles, California and they have 350+ employees on their team.

**The Management**

**Tony Aquila**.

Tony serves as executive chairman and founded Solera Holdings a successful company that provides risk management, asset protection software, services to the automotive industry and property insurance. He has also served as chairman for multiple other companies including Sportradar Group,Aircraft Performance Group,RocketRoute Limited, global aviation services company, and  APG Avionics LLC.

[A few other positions that can be seen here](https://investors.canoo.com/company-information/management-team)

**Financials**

Canoo is a company that has not turned a profit but this most likely is largely due to them not releasing any consumer vehicles. What Canoo has done however is reduce their net loss year over year quite dramatically. In 2019 they had a net loss of $182,360(in thousands) that they were able to reduce to $89,818(in thousands) of net loss in 2020, which is nearly 100 thousand less loss than the previous year, this could have been due to COVID-19. They have also increased their cash/Cash equivalents from 29,507(In thousands) to 702,422(in thousands) which is very good growth. 

**Concerns**

On April 12 2021 according to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/securities-class-action-filed-against-165000354.html): Berman Tabacco has filed a class action lawsuit for violations of the federal securities laws against Canoo Inc. 

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goev-investor-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-150000588.html) gives more details saying: The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) Canoo had decreased its focus on its plan to sell vehicles to consumers through a subscription model; (2) Canoo would de-emphasize its engineering services business; (3) contrary to prior statements, Canoo did not have partnerships with original equipment manufacturers and no longer engaged in the previously announced partnership with Hyundai; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked reasonable basis at all relevant times.

[Canoo had another no revenue Quarter ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3677481-canoo-swings-lower-after-no-revenue-quarter)

My thoughts: I think that while the recent class action Lawsuit may cause some issues for the company Canoo has a unique product that could become popular, has enough cash to run the business for multiple years even if the release is delayed, and has good management that is in touch with the business Canoo is in.","['GM', 'DE']"

mpgnog,,investing,post,1618242555,"Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023. Mobileye is working with the startup Udelv to manufacture 35,000 delivery vehicles[Link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023)

Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service.

Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.

“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told The Verge. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”

“This is a real commercial deployment”

Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.

The company is also testing autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well.

“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”

Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations.

The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like Nuro and Einride. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis.

The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers

Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date.

While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up.

That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions.

“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”",['INTC']

mprkx9,,investing,post,1618275211,"About the CPI report 4/13/2021 8:30 AM ESTOn Tuesday morning the BLS will release the monthly CPI figures for March. It will no doubt be closely watched and any deviation from expectations could significantly move the market.

So let's start with the expectations.

Currently the consensus is for CPI to be 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.

For Core CPI, the expectations are 0.2% month-over-month and 1.5% year-over-year.

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/economic-calendar

Although the Fed's preferred inflation metric is the PCE deflator, they say they do pay attention to several inflation indicators. So these are still important figures.

You also may have heard the Fed say that they expect inflation to be higher in the near term. There's good reason for this. As this report is for March 2021, the year-over-year comparison will be the first significant month of the Covid-19 pandemic, March 2020. In that month, the CPI actually fell by -0.3%. In April 2020, prices fell again by -0.7%. These figures are very unusual, as the spring months usually see price increases. So for the next two months, the year-over-year comparisons are going to be impacted greatly by the very weak spring from 2020.

This is why inflation may seem high than the Fed prefers, but there is indeed a good chance that it is temporary due to the weak year-over-year comparisons. However, the market is priced in at certain assumptions mentioned earlier. If inflation comes in hotter than 0.5% headline and 0.2% core, the market could sell off. Similarly, if it comes in less than those figures, the market could rally.

We'll know Tuesday at 8:30 AM EST. It could be interesting.",
mprkx9,gucgqvb,investing,comment,1618296862,"I don't think it's clear what the market will do in either case.

Higher than expected -> buy because you'd rather hold assets? sell because you think the fed will ease off?

Lower than expected -> buy because you think the fed will continue to print? sell because cash isn't being devalued as everyone expects?

Investing is hard man",
mprkx9,gud62bb,investing,comment,1618318523,"It was up .6% in March. What worries me so much about this is the powers that be (Powell, etc...) keep saying that they expect inflation to pick up this year, but they are sure it will be ""transitory"" or a short term thing, then it will just go away. I realize I don't know nearly as much as them, but doesn't inflation have a psychological effect, that feeds on itself? When people see prices rising quickly they change their behavior, which causes prices to rise more, etc... 

Inflation is not easy to get under control, so why are people so confident that this time will be different?",
mpllls,,investing,post,1618256463,"In-depth DD on Bio Stock Nearing Approval of Breakthrough Drug to Treat Depression: Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) 

**Company Overview:**

Axesome  Therapeutics is a bio-pharmaceutical company that develops therapies  for managing a wide range of Central Nervous System disorders. It had  its IPO in 2015 but saw its market cap skyrocket in early and late 2019  around impressive results of clinical trials on its most hyped product,  an oral medication to treat depression. They intend to market their  products in the U.S. internally and partner with other companies to  market them internationally. Their development strategy is to combine  existing medicinal ingredients in novel ways with their proprietary  improvements. By using ingredients already proven safe and effective,  they believe they can reduce regulatory risk, decrease development  costs, and increase time to market. Unlike some emerging  bio-pharmaceutical companies, they are not reliant on a single product  or 2 as they have 5 different ones currently in development. Every  product has had at least 1 successful clinical trial, and their 2 top  products have been either submitted for New Drug Application (NDA) or  are nearing submission.

Their  executive management team and board of directors have a good mix of  medical expertise and previous business experience in similar companies.  Their top-level management comprises 7 people, including 2 with an MD, 2  with a PharmD, and 2 with an MBA. The CEO previously was a partner at  Healthcor, an asset management company focused on healthcare stocks with  a portfolio of $2.5B. Their board comprises 4 people, including 2 with  an MD and 1 with a pharamacology PhD. The director previously served as  President and co-CEO of United Therapeutics where he led their IPO.  United Therapeutics (UTHR) now has a yearly revenue of $1.5B and market  cap of $9B.

**FDA Approval Overview:**

Here’s a brief and generalized explanation of how drugs get approved by the FDA.

Phase 1 Trial: The main point is to make sure the drug is safe, although efficacy is also measured.

Phase 2 Trial: The main point is to make a preliminary determination whether the drug works and is safe.

Phase  3 Trial: The main point is to expand the scope of Phase 2 and make a  statistically significant determination whether the drug works and is  safe.

NDA Preparation: The company  gathers a ton of information about the drug, including data taken from  clinical trials as well as information about manufacturing and  marketing.

NDA Submission: After  submission, the FDA has 60 days to determine if it has the requisite  information. If it does, then it is accepted for review.

NDA  Review: The FDA tries to review 90% of its applications within 1 year  of submission. However, reviews are not done on a first-come,  first-serve basis as some can be prioritized for early review. Those  prioritized include drugs marked with Breakthrough Therapy Designation,  and the FDA tries to review 90% of those applications within 6 months of  submission.

COVID-19 slowed the  review process last year and created a backlog of of pending reviews  because it requires the FDA to visit manufacturing and clinical sites,  among other things. It shouldn’t be an issue going forward with  vaccination rates rising and restrictions easing across the country, but  the backlog will need to be navigated.

NDA Approval: After approval, the drug can be marketed and commercialized according to guidelines set forth by the FDA.

**Product Development:**

AXS-05:  An oral medication to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is one  of the most common mental health disorders, affecting about 17 million  people in the U.S. Incidence of depression was also markedly higher in  the past year during COVID-19, so there may be a residual increase in  the following years. There are many existing treatments for it, but  their side effects and the extent of treatment-resistant depression  (TRD) have opened the door to other emerging treatments, including  ketamine, psilocybin, and AXS-05. AXS-05 is a combination of bupropin  (i.e. an existing generic anti-depressant available under brand name  Wellbutrin) and dextromethorpan (i.e. an active ingredient used in cough  syrup).

While ketamine and  psilocybin show promise, they are likely a ways off from widespread  adoption. AXS-05, on the other hand, has already completed several Phase  2 and 3 Trials and their positive results prompted a Breakthrough  Therapy Designation. In July 2020, they announced a successful meeting  with the FDA to discuss pre-submission of their NDA. In early 2021, they  submitted their NDA. Based on the drug’s use of already tested  ingredients, results from their trials, and their meeting with the FDA,  they believe their application will be accepted and approved in  relatively short order.

AXS-05 is  also being developed to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) agitation and  tobacco cessation. It should be noted there are no FDA-approved drugs to  treat AD agitation, which affects about 4 million people in the U.S.  out of the 6 million with AD. If approved, it would become the first and  only one to treat it. For the treatment of AD agitation, they have  completed a Phase 3 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough Therapy  designation. For the treatment of tobacco cessation, they have a Phase 2  Trial in progress.

AXS-07: An  oral medication to treat migraines. Migraines are one of the most common  illnesses, affecting about 37 million people in the U.S. AXS-07  contains a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, a serotonin inhibitor,  and an enzyme to speed up absorption of the agents. There are several  existing treatments for migraines, but this one hopes to separate itself  by being quicker-acting while being at least as effective as the  others. Given how quickly migraines can appear and ramp up to high  levels of pain, time to effectiveness is a major consideration.

They  have completed a physician survey which confirmed the unmet need for  better migraine treatment and have a Phase 3 Trial in progress. In  December 2020, they announced a successful meeting with the FDA around  pre-submission of their NDA. As of now, they are preparing their NDA  submission.

AXS-09: An oral  medication to treat to-be-determined CNS disorders. They have completed a  Phase 1 Trial. They have significantly reduced funding for this drug’s  development in the past 2 years after the success of their other  products, and it’s looking like this one may not come to fruition.

AXS-12:  An oral medication to treat narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare  disorder, affecting about 185,000 people in the U.S. AXS-12 is a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is owned  by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use it.  They have completed a Phase 2 Trial and were awarded Breakthrough  Therapy designation.

AXS-14:  An  oral medicaiton to treat fibromyalgia.  Fibromyalgia is a common  disorder affecting about 5 million people in the U.S. AXS-14 is also a  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. One of its main ingredients is also  owned by Pfizer, and they have an exclusive agreement with Pfizer to use  it. They have completed a Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial.

In  November 2020, they announced a partnership with Veeva Systems to  develop a digital-centric commercialization platform. Veeva has a  lengthy history of successfully supporting similar systems, including  companies such as GSK, Eli Lilly, Merck, Bayer, Cardinal Health,  AstraZeneca, and more.

To sum up,  they have 5 products with 7 therapeutic purposes, all of which have at  least 1 successful clinic trial. In addition, 3 have Breakthrough  Therapy Designation, 1 is nearing NDA submission, and 1 has been  submitted for NDA. Their most hyped product, AXS-05 to treat MDD, has  been submitted, and AXS-07 to treat migrations is nearing submission.  MDD affects about 17 million people in the U.S. and migraines affect  about 37 million, so the potential market is huge for these drugs.  They’re ramping up commercialization resources to prepare for their  approval.

**Finances:**

Their operating costs have increased significantly  over the years as their product lineup has expanded and progressed  toward FDA approval. It’s not likely to decrease from here as they will  need to build up their manufacturing and marketing after approval of  their NDAs. However, their 2020 R&D figure is slightly elevated as  it includes a one-time $10.2MM cost for their Pfizer agreement. In  addition, the majority of the G&A increase from 2019 to 2020 is due  to increased stock compensation for employees.

Their  operations have been financed by equity offerings and loans. Most  recently, they did a public offering in December 2019 after their stock  price skyrocketed and sold 2.3 million shares for $87 apiece, netting  them $200.1MM. In September 2020, they received a $225MM loan from  Hercules Capital. The loan will not have principal due to be paid back  until 2023, but the amount owed can be increased based on timelines of  NDA approvals and revenue benchmarks. As a part of the loan, the company  agreed to indefinitely maintain a market cap of at least $2B starting  at 1 year after approval of their AXS-05 or AXS-07 NDA. Given their  current market cap of $1.98B, it seems they think the market cap should  be significantly higher post-approval than it is currently. Overall,  they state their current resources should fund their anticipated  operations into 2024, including expected costs for the commercial launch  of AXS-05 and AXS-07. As such, I don’t expect another offering in the  near future.

The company has zero  revenue, and its products closest to commercialization have yet to be  approved by the FDA. If and when they are approved, they will still need  to be manufactured and marketed before they will start making money. In  addition, not-insignificant portions of the company’s future revenue  will be used to pay back their debtors.

According to an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716)  from JAMA, in 2013 the U.S. spent $71.1B on treating depression,  including $22.8B on pharmaceuticals. $7.3B was spent on treating  migraines, including $2.9B on pharmaceuticals. These figures have  undoubtedly increased since the 2013 study given inflation, population  growth, and the increased focus on mental health treatment in the U.S.  It’s unknown if the company’s products will be successfully  commercialized, but the potential revenue is high if it can attain a  reasonable market share. Using the 2013 figures with CPI inflation (14%  since 2013) and World Bank country population growth (3.9% since 2013), a  5% U.S. market share in depression and migraine pharmaceutical  treatment would produce $1.52B yearly revenue. In addition, they may  gain revenue from international commercialization and their other  products. In particular, getting approval for AXS-05 to treat AD  agitation could be a large source of potential revenue.

Biotech companies tend to run high P/S ratios, and you can see the [current ratio](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&sg=healthcare&v=120&o=name)  for the sector is 16.8. Emerging ones often run much higher than that.  It’s very difficult to predict revenue for a company with none yet, but  if they were able to achieve $400M by the end of 2024 with a P/S of 20,  they would have a market cap of $8B (304% increase over the current  value). That figure assumes a lot of things going right and should in no  way be expected, but it shows the kind of speculation that’s driving  its current valuation.

**Stock History and Ownership:**

The  stock IPO’d at $9 in 2015. It slowly decreased until the beginning of  2019 which saw it jump back to its original IPO price. This was because  they announced positive results from their Phase 2 Trial of AXS-05 to  treat MDD and presented their results at the Annual Biotech Showcase.  The price had impressive upwards movement throughout 2019 with the  release of more good news, but saw it skyrocket up to $100 in December  2019 based on positive results from their Phase 3 Trial of AXS-05. They  used this opportunity to do a public offering, which only slightly  decreased the price. When the company recovered in mid-2020 after the  COVID-19 drop, it had uneven, but overall slightly downward, movement  for the rest of 2020. It closed the year at $81. Since then, it has  started to move downward more sharply until hitting the current price at  $52.99 with a market cap of $1.98B. Note that there has not been an  offering since 2019, so the recent drop in price is not due to share  dilution. In addition, short volume has no significantly increased  during the recent price drop and has stayed at an average of around 12%  of total volume.

AXSM  has a large insider and institutional ownership at 21% and 64%  respectively. No insiders have sold their shares even as the stock hit  its ATH around $100 and slowly fell to its current price. On the  contrary, their CFO and Board Director purchased an additional $110,000  worth of shares last year at market value when the price was around $80.  Institutional owners have also largely held onto the stock, continuing  to accumulate while it was in the $70-85 range. Among institutional  owners, the largest are Antecip Capital (i.e. a company that loaned them  money years ago in exchange for shares before their market cap  skyrocketed), Vanguard, Venrock Healthcare Capital, Blackrock, and  Iridian Asset Management. I should note that Sabby Management is the 6th  largest institutional owner at 5% of the shares. It’s known as a  short-seller. However, the market cap is large enough that I don’t  expect it to be a major consideration like it could be for a micro cap  stock.

[MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AXSM/price-target/)  shows 12 analyst price targets within the past year, including 11 Buys  and 1 Sell and ranging from $66 to $200. This includes 3 since the start  of 2021, all Buys: Jeffries at $129 on 1/8, Mizuho at $118 on 3/2, and  Morgan Stanley at $104 on 3/8.

There  has been no significant negative news about the company in 2021, and  short volume has remained fairly constant during the recent price drop  at an average of around 12%. However, the entire emerging  healthcare/biotech sector has been down since its peak in early 2021, as  can be approximately seen by the ETF SBIO above. The slide in stock  price can likely be attributed to some combination of the following: 1)  Poor recent sector performance; 2) A small miss in earnings for Q4 2020  (EPS loss of .78 compared to expected loss of .73); 3) A drop in  hype-driven growth as shareholders haven’t received continuous positive  PR like last year; and 4) Delays in expected NDA timelines. The AXS-05  and AXS-07 NDAs were expected to be submitted in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021  respectively, but both were delayed by a quarter. In addition, there has  been no update from AXSM that their AXS-05 NDA was accepted for filing.  I believe this is more likely to be related to the FDA COVID-19 backlog  rather than an issue with the filing, but the price action implies it  carries an additional risk. Note that only [4%](https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143806/FDA-RefuseToFile-Decisions-Are-Rare-But-CMC-And-Ignoring-Agency-Advice-Are-Often-Triggers)  of NDAs are rejected for filing, and AXS-05 should be even less likely  to be rejected than the average NDA given its Breakthrough Therapy  Designation.

Short-term,  it’s hard to predict what the price action will be. An announcement of  whether the AXS-05 NDA was accepted could happen any day now. I could  not find an exact date for when it was submitted, so it is unclear when  the 60-day benchmark for the decision will be reached. The more amount  of time that goes by without an update, the more the stock may  potentially drop. If it’s rejected, which I believe is possible but very  unlikely, the price would likely drop further. If it’s accepted, the  price is likely to at least stabilize and could start an upward trend.  Assuming it’s accepted, its approval determination likely in the summer  or fall will have another significant impact on its price. Approval  rates are very high, as most drugs fail before they reach this phase. As  you can see from this [chart](https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf),  drugs that treat other diseases and reach NDA submission achieve  approval 88.4% of the time. Given that AXS-05 has held many successful  trials including multiple at the Phase 2 and 3 levels, it was given  Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, and AXSM had a successful  pre-submission meeting with the FDA, I believe the chance of approval is  likely even higher. The stock previously jumped from $40 to $100 on the  positive results of its most recent AXS-05 trial, and it’s possible  there could be a similar jump once it gets approved. Other short-term  considerations include: 1) The filing, acceptance, and approval of the  AXS-07 NDA. The filing should occur in Q2; 2) Results from a AXS-07  trial to treat migraines and AXS-05 trial to treat TRD in Q2-Q3; and 3) A  pre-submission FDA meeting for AXS-14 to treat fibromyalgia in Q2-3.

I  don’t rely heavily on technical analysis, but I know others do and it’s  worth considering. The technical indicators are not good. Some good  ones are that the trading volume has remained fairly constant over the  past few months as the price has fallen, indicating that the price  decrease is not due to a significant dip in volume. The RSI(14) is 28,  indicating oversold. If you squint, the chart could be interpreted as  forming a falling wedge, which could be a bullish indicator. However,  the stock fell below a previous support level in early March and has not  stabilized with a new resistance level. The SMA50 crossed below the  SMA200 at the same time, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD line has  been slightly below the signal line for most of 2021 and both are in the  negative, indicating a bearish trend.

**Summary:**

To  sum up, this is a bio-pharmaceutical company with an exciting product  lineup, including a novel drug to treat depression that may get FDA  approval as early as this summer and a novel drug to treat migraines  that may get FDA approval as early as the fall. The cons are that it has  debt, no current revenue, currently no FDA-approved products, and is  still valued at $1.98B. The pros are that it has enough resources to  last until 2024, insiders and institutional owners have not sold their  shares even when the price was near double its current value, analyst  price targets are well above the current price, the chances for FDA  approval look high, and even a small fraction of the relevant U.S.  market share for their drugs nearing approval would create billions in  yearly revenue. Its short-term downward price movement is concerning and  represents some potential risk, but it also has created an opportunity  to buy in at a price that has the potential to be 50+% higher later in  the year.

mpcyf2,,investing,post,1618231089,"Containership Boom: Rates Even Higher**BUY: $NMM $ZIM**

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024. 

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM). 

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. 

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I’ve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

In the short-term you might see some volatility or discrepancies but in the long-term, money follows where money is being made.

This is part of the efficient market framework that people are  so quick to dismiss. Can Tesla or Gamestop continue to have high valuations? Sure...but if they don't start making that expected future cash via increasing earnings and revenues, the market will let Elon Musk and Ryan Cohen know pretty quick.

This is why people like me always recommend a globally-diversified, low-cost index fund like VT. Money will flow wherever the cash is been made.

mohir3,,investing,post,1618104600,"Americans think it’s better to invest in housing than the stock market — here’s whyWhich is the better investment, owning a home or owning stocks? If you ask most Americans, chances are they prefer the former.

A new study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York examined consumer preferences toward being a homeowner and how their attitudes have changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were asked to rate which was the better investment — a home or financial assets such as a stocks — and what factors contributed to their choice.

The study found that over 90% of respondents preferred owning their primary residence rather than investing in the stock market. A majority of survey-takers also favored the idea of being a landlord to purchasing stocks, with more than 50% of the participating households preferring to own a rental property.

The most common reasons people cited in choosing housing over stocks seemed to be about comfort and stability, rather than seeking a better return. The most commonly-selected responses were that the home was their “desired living environment” and “provides stability” and that house prices were “less volatile.”

Research has shown that residential real-estate has acted as a strong hedge in most bear markets, with the notable exception of the Great Recession. The early days of the pandemic is a prime example: The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% lost over 20% in the first quarter, while the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 1.4%. That stock market has, of course, recovered since then.

That said, Americans were more likely to cite higher housing returns in 2021 than in the year prior, likely a reflection of the incredibly fast pace of home price appreciation nationwide.

But people’s attitudes toward the housing market have shifted over the course of the pandemic, the researchers found. “The preference for housing dipped in October 2020 and returned back to the pre-COVID level by February 2021,” the study’s authors noted.

That shift in preferences away from housing wasn’t driven by concerns about home prices. Some Americans expressed more concern about the risk of vacant rental units, while concerns about being able to make mortgage payments may have had an effect on people’s predilection toward homeownership.

People’s inclination toward owning a home may also be a reflection of their gender or education. Women were more likely to prefer housing than men, and non-college graduates opted for homeownership more often than those with college diplomas.

I'm not sure now that properties are very expensive and don't cash flow nearly as well (or, usually at all) you can expect the same safe and robust returns. 

Though owning your own home is probably a safe expense to have regardless. The equity building process can be almost like constantly putting money in a bank account pegged to inflation. 
I bet ownership just kind of feels nice too. Especially if you are settling down and no longer want to move around and experience new places.  Probably a very freeing experience to have something that is totally yours.",

In 2021 the NFL is worth 5.7 billion dollars, all because from a few individuals has a dream and took a major gamble.

The  first real season play fpr SNPW is just about ready to just began for SNPW,

SNPW's  teams:

Medrecycler, Sun Pacific Power, Street Smart Outdoors, and   National Mechanical Group  (non glass  solar panels)  are just about done with their exhibition season and about ready  to play for real.

What the exhibition season has revealed so far about the  SNPW teams

\-  The Company’s subsidiary Medrecycler RI, Inc. continues to progress  through the regulatory process  for the approval to construct a 48,000  SF state-of-the-art pyrolysis  facility expected to process 70 tons of  medical waste per day. With approval and the completion of financing,  the project should be operational by the end of 2021

\-  One man who reviewed the tech of Medrecycler has enough faith in the   technology and business plan, that he sees fit to committed 17 MILLION   DOLLARS to buy all the Rhode Island bonds to finance the project.

\-  Many cities have shown faith in the LONG TERM VALUE of Street Smart  outdoor advertising to award them decade long contracts.  Street Smart  is expanding and adding new services to it;s product.  Geopath is  expected to support a strategy for expanding our market reach to  targeted advertisers in the OOH industry and  Atlas Transit Solutions to  collaborate on the development of a  high efficiency off grid digital  plug and play modular unit will  develop a new SMART Bus Shelter which  integrates a new software as a  service that enhances the commuters  experience while driving a new  unique and proprietary product offering

\-  The US Patient office after viewing the science  the technology   granted 5 patents o the Non-glass solar panels and the manufacturing  process for it.  UL certification for the non glass solar panels iare in  the process

\- Free agents were  signed to aid in the Durango Mexico Solar Farm team,  one a solar farm  developer the other a financial backer. Durango Mexico Solar Farm  project  currently undergoing a financial review with a selected EPC and  funding group. This partnership is targeting a financial closing and  the commencement of construction in 2021

As  the exhibition season winds down, we have a chance to evaluation what  type of play we expect to see once the real season begins.

Pre-season  tickets are cheap right now but prices will only go up once  the real season fully starts, and one  can only imagine what those tickets will be  worth after our first complete season and we get to the Super Bowl.

mo5ii4,gu1mw1u,investing,comment,1618064549,URNM - it is directly affected by the demand for uranium. It's also been doing consistently well over these last several weird weeks in the market,
mo5ii4,gu1sh4k,investing,comment,1618067465,"Nuclear power in Europe is currently declining, and I would expect it would continue to decline. There are a few nuclear reactors currently under construction in Europe (UK, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia) but they won't replace the reactors that will be closing.

However, nuclear power is growing in Asia, particularly in China and India. China is currently building a number of reactors, with plans to build many more in order to transition away from coal. Globally, nuclear energy accounts for about 10% of the energy mix and the IAEA projects that by 2050, it will account for somewhere between 6-12%.

Keep in mind that the construction of new reactors is very costly and takes a long time. Maybe there is a play there with reactor construction. The shorter term catalyst in the uranium market will be currently operating nuclear plants securing long-term contracts for supply. Prices have been depressed for a decade and continue to be below the global cost of production. Miners were slow to respond, and there was a lot of existing supply in national stockpiles that were being put into the market, but in the last few years production has been tapering off and is below global demand. At some point, power plants will have to step back into the market and sign multi-year deals to secure supply. Its worth noting as well that the cost of uranium is a pretty small part of the price of generating the power, so plants have plenty of room to pay more.

I would stick to ETFs to get broad sector coverage because it's hard to pick winners and losers. URNM was already mentioned, which is a good choice. My money is currently in URA, which is slightly more concentrated with a slightly lower fee. You're a little late to the game as money has already started to move back into the sector, but there still should be a lot of room for growth as demand picks up.

Edit: After reading a lot of the posts that have been made since I first posted, I would just like to add that this is supposed to be an investing subreddit. The OP didn't ask what you or your friends think about nuclear energy. Nor did he ask you to dream about a time when nuclear energy won't be necessary.

Nuclear power is in decline globally, but still accounts for a large part of the global power mix and is growing in some parts of the world. If you think it isn't ethical, then don't invest your money. Do I want to own Cameco stock in 100 years? No. Will I take the 60% I've made off it already, plus the potential upside of another 100% when uranium prices recover? Yes.

If you don't know about nuclear energy or uranium mining, you shouldn't talk about it on an investing sub. In 2 years, my investments in the uranium mining space have returned an average of 100%. I've sold a bit when prices peaked, but I'm still holding most because uranium prices still haven't recovered. Maybe we can start talking about how to make money, instead of whether fusion reactors are the future or whatever.",
modaz8,,investing,post,1618089578,"Assets Have Tanked at Two of the World’s Biggest Short Sellers**Short Selling is a Risky Business.** 

Original Article: [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1rb09jvppdv1d/Assets-Have-Tanked-at-Two-of-the-World-s-Biggest-Short-Sellers) 

 Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital got much smaller in 2020, according to new regulatory filings. 

If there’s any lingering doubt about how awful 2020 was for short sellers, recently released securities filings make the pain abundantly clear.

Jim Chanos’ Kynikos Associates and Jim Carruthers’ Sophos Capital — both of which started 2020 with around $1 billion in regulatory assets — ended the year a shadow of their former selves.

Chanos, arguably the most well-known short seller in the world, lost more than 50 percent of its assets last year. Kynikos ended 2020 with about $405 million in regulatory assets under management, down from around $932 million the prior year, according to annual ADV filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The long bull market has punished Chanos for years. In 2018, when *Institutional Investor* profiled him, Kynikos ran just under $2 billion, having already lost almost three-quarters of his assets since the financial crash of 2008, when it ran $7 billion.

\[*II* Deep Dive: [How Jim Chanos Uses Cynicism, Chutzpah — and a Secret Twitter Account — to Take on Markets (and Elon Musk)](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1b00ynrgtn05r/How-Jim-Chanos-Uses-Cynicism-Chutzpah-and-a-Secret-Twitter-Account-to-Take-on-Markets-and-Elon-Musk)\]

Kynikos is heavily diversified, and runs several funds, including one that also goes long via indexes. Short positions rarely are more than 5 percent of the total portfolio. And his short-only fund, Ursus, is a small portion of the regulatory assets. It’s now only about $27 million, according to the ADV, down from about $59 million at the end of 2019.

That said, last year Chanos’s most notable loss was his Tesla short. Elon Musk’s electric car company skyrocketed by more than 700 percent last year, and Chanos — long a Tesla foe — had to scramble.

In January he told CNBC the firm had transformed his short into puts — a common strategy when short sellers are forced to cover their stock shorts. (This year, Tesla is down, but by just 3 percent.)

One bright spot for Chanos in 2020 was his Wirecard short. He told the Financial Times last summer that he made $100 million on that short when the German fintech company collapsed in scandal in June. 

Sophos had an even more dramatic decline than Kynikos. 

The firm started 2020 as the [world’s largest short seller](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1q3cxqlbmltyl/The-World-s-Biggest-Short-Selling-Hedge-Fund-Is-Scaling-Back) with $1.16 billion in regulatory assets under management. But by year end, the firm was winding down some positions and scaling back, as *Institutional Investor* previously reported. Sophos ended 2020 with $258 million, according to its ADV.

Carruthers, who ran the short book for Dan Loeb at Third Point before starting Sophos, launched his short-biased firm in 2014 with $200 million, including a seed investment from Yale University’s endowment.

Another short seller that couldn’t stave off the pain was Fahmi Quadir’s Safkhet Capital. 

Last year Quadir told *II* that she had wagered [25 percent](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m97rvgqnn94q/fahmi-quadir-s-winning-wirecard-short) of the fund’s capital on its Wirecard short, which had been the largest contributor to the fund’s gains since launch in 2018.

That didn’t stop the bleeding at Safkhet, which ended 2020 with about $27 million, down from almost $85 million in regulatory assets under management at the end of 2019, according to its ADV filings. 

It’s unclear how much of these declines were due to performance and how much was caused by redemptions.

Given the complicated way the regulatory assets under management are calculated for short sellers, the numbers themselves may be overstated when it comes to the actual capital these funds have under management.

Chanos, Carruthers, and Quadir did not respond to requests for comment.

One short seller said that many shorts got caught out last year by focusing on what he called “discretionary” and “story names,” like Tesla and other highflying tech stocks.

“Many short sellers were short biotech, and these stocks went up four fold,” he said. “None of these guys were short banks or energy.”

According to the short seller, sector choice was what mattered most in 2020.  “Short tech or healthcare was terrible,” he said. “You wanted to be short energy and banks.”

But, he noted, “this year that has reversed completely.”","['TWTR', 'TSLA']"

modaz8,gu3kc0d,investing,comment,1618100815,"I think this indicates the realities of running a fund that is negatively correlated with the market.  In theory it sounds like a great place to put a percentage of assets to reduce risk in a portfolio.  And right after a big crash when people look at the returns it seems even more prudent.  But deeper and deeper into a bull market, the lessons of the last crash are forgotten, the returns of such a fund look miserable compared to the general market, and people naturally pull their money out.   The nail in the coffin is bull markets are generally seven or eight years and bear markets are one or two.  It looks like a bad business model.",

mok1fb,,investing,post,1618114299,"$MHH - Value Stock in this market; my DDMastech Digital is a high level IT staffing and Data management/analytics firm.  Its market cap is $200m making it a micro/small cap firm.  I think that it is on the cusp of big things.

FCF CAGR:  53.4% over 10 growth periods, 31.3% @ 7yrs,  and 111.3% @ 3 years.  BVPS CAGR at 10, 7, 3 years is 14.6%, 24.7%, and 28% respectively.  EPS is 28.1%, 9.5%, and 73.1% over those growth periods.  Revenue Growth Rate is 10.5%, 8.9%, and 9.5%.  Return on Equity (ROE) grew at 11.5% compounded over 10 years and 40.4% over the last 3 years.  At the 7 year mark ROE spiked because the company bought back over 600K shares.  That skews the ROE CAGR for that time span.  Its Long-Term Debt to Earnings sits at value of 1.35, and its ROIC is 0.35.  Yahoo Finance has analysts predictions of 18% annual growth over the next five years.

Mastech Digital did have a flat year in 2020 due to Covid-19.  Their revenue growth was flat YoY from 2019 and they did miss their EPS by $0.03.  This has lead to the stock trading between $16.00 to $18.00 per share so far this year.

Two discounted calcs that I ran with a 15% compounded rate of return on the company put its current value between $32.00 to $44.00.  Factor in a huge Margin of Safety and that puts my buy range between $16.00 - $22.00.

Mastech Digital is a minority owned business and I recall reading it has a higher than average number of women in its senior positions (although as of this posting I cannot find my source on that second piece).

2020 was an incredibly tough year for many businesses.  Staffing agencies suffered across most if not all sectors.  Despite this, Mastech Digital's financials, while down, were not terrible compared YoY and their overall profit margin increased.  This suggests to me that their cost controls allow them to absorb significant economic down turns, and they can compete effectively in their market from a pricing standpoint.  There is a marketable advantage in that the company is minority owned and they recognize the value of women in upper management roles.  As 2021 shows an economy that is ramping up I believe demand for highly skilled IT staff is going to explode.  Companies that put off data management and data analytics consulting will move forward with those plans.  Mastech Digital is going to have an amazing year, and I'm excited to own a piece of the company.

I put about 6% of my non-retirement portfolio into this company and I'm thinking of putting in a little bit more.  I would love to hear your feedback.

The S&P 500 fell 0.12%, after hitting a record high of 4,130.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, or 86 points, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.44%.

Consumer discretionary and financials supported the broader market's move to record highs, with the latter coming under the spotlight as major banks report quarterly earnings this week.

Major Wall Street banks reporting include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Wall Street's outlook on quarterly earnings appears bullish, with cyclicals backed to show strong quarterly results.

""We anticipate S&P 500 Index earnings per share will grow by more than 30% this year with cyclical sectors such as industrials, consumer discretionary, materials, and financials leading the way,"" Wells Fargo said.

Energy stocks slipped on a retreat oil prices from session highs as investors weighed up the ongoing progress on vaccinations against ongoing Covid-19 restrictions that threaten energy demand.  

Technology started the week on the backfoot stifled by weakness in chip stocks and mixed trading among the Fab 5.

Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was higher.

Microsoft said it will buy speech-recognition firm Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) for $19.7 billion in a bid to boost its foray into healthcare.

""The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors at a time in which hospitals and doctors are embracing next generation AI capabilities from thought leaders such as Nuance,"" Wedbush said in a note.

In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was down 1% just days after the company urged 16 airline customers to ground its 737 Max jets, citing electrical issues. The issues, however, are not expected to cause major disruptions.

""Changing the equipment could take hours or days to fix, a modest disruption,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note Friday.

In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped more than 3% after receiving an upgrade from Canaccord, citing a bullish outlook for the company's battery storage business.

Canaccord upgraded Tesla to buy from hold, and lifted its price on the company to $1,071 from $419 per share.","['WFC', 'AAPL', 'BAC', 'DOW', 'NDAQ', 'GS', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'SPGI', 'TSLA', 'BA', 'JPM', 'GOOGL', 'FB']"

mopsuv,,investing,post,1618142387,"The bear case for BABA (no news is bad news)The stock is down from ATHs for good reasons due to fundamental changes to the the risk profile of the company, and uncertainties regarding the potential for future success it may have moving forward. 

-	The negative CCP attention and ongoing regulatory risk remain in place and unchanged. That’s a reason for the stock to go down or trade flat, not an argument for upside potential. 

-	The fundamentals of the company are the same as they’ve been the last few months. No new revenue drivers or cost savings measures have been revealed that would indicate a change from the recent status quo. That’s an argument for the stock to trade flat or go down. Not an argument for upside potential.

-	Investor sentiment remains unchanged.  No new “buzz-worthy” events are coming up and no recent company news that I see promises to serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest or inflows. 

So what’s changed? Anything?

Are these assumptions correct or did I miss something? What makes BABA an attractive investment to consider now, rather than a wait-and-see story which may or may not see upside in the near- to mid-term? Or should I assume this is a dead money play for the reasons stated above. 


TL:DR 

What’s the bull case for BABA besides “It was higher before, so it will be higher again” or “it’s already fallen a lot, why would it fall anymore?” Those are valid hopes, but not good reasons to think that a course reversal is imminent. Down to flat are the trends, so they’ll continue until they have reason not to. Opportunity cost says steer clear.",

mok0m1,,investing,post,1618114213,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy?A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, [in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377332-50-worst-s-and-p-500-stocks-of-3q)

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?",
mok0m1,gu4oqfr,investing,comment,1618128647,I think this is a version of a long-short alpha strategy (or whatever) but the flaw may be that those companies may be expensive to short if the market already thinks they’re losers. Also puts may not be available.,

mobt6t,,investing,post,1618084613,"U.S. SEC review of socially responsible funds finds 'potentially misleading' claimsWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it has found ""potentially misleading"" claims and inadequate controls around investing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in a review of investment advisors and funds.

The regulator warned funds that its review had turned up a range of issues where stated approaches of funds or advisors did not match actions. That included examples with how firms handled proxy voting on behalf of investors, as well as ""unsubstantiated and potentially misleading claims"" regarding socially responsible investment strategies.

The alert is the latest in a series of actions the agency has taken to incorporate climate risks and social and governance issues into its framework since the inauguration President Joe Biden.

Last month, the SEC deployed a team to police climate risk disclosure issues. It has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.

Socially responsible funds have grown more popular with investors in recent years. A record $51 billion flooded into sustainable U.S. funds in 2020 alone, according to Morningstar. But critics have said that some may overstate their credentials to attract cash.

The SEC's exam staff, which is continuing its review, found instances where firms did not have formal processes in place for ESG investing, though they claimed to. In some cases, the SEC said advisors did not have ways to ""reasonably track"" or screen for investments in certain industries.

In the case of proxy voting, the SEC said it found instances where some investors were told they could vote separately on ESG-related proposals, but then were never given that chance.",

In a globalized world, there is only so much you can do to abstract away negative ESG factors from the companies you invest in. The first line company itself can try to be socially conscious, but at some point their money is going to make its way back into unethical labor, environmental, and social practices. Do they need to ship products? Do they rely on paper? Do they use energy? Where are they sourcing their paper, pens, desks/furniture and other supplies? The world is just too intertwined to avoid having your money make its way back into the hands of companies with unethical practices, and anyone who thinks that they're making a difference by looking for ESG companies are kidding themselves.

I definitely think that we should all be trying to make the world a better, more ethical place, but I don't think this is a good avenue for making that change.

mnvx7u,,investing,post,1618020605,"China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion in Landmark Antitrust CaseThe penalty is Beijing’s toughest action to date in its campaign to tighten supervision of the country’s internet Goliaths.

Beijing’s market watchdog began investigating Alibaba in December for potential antitrust violations including preventing merchants from selling their goods on other shopping platforms. On Saturday, the regulator said its investigation had concluded that Alibaba had hindered competition in online retail in China, affected innovation in the internet economy and harmed consumers’ interests.

Alibaba said in a statement that it would accept the penalty “sincerely” and would strengthen its internal systems “to better carry out its social responsibilities.”

Skepticism about the clout of large internet companies has been on the rise in the United States and Europe, too. Western regulators have repeatedly fined Goliaths such as Google in recent years for various antitrust violations. But such penalties generally have not changed the nature of the companies’ businesses enough to mitigate concerns about their power.

mo6q8h,,investing,post,1618068257,"DD on Novartis (NVS), and their role in the treatment of opioid dependence disorderThis is my first DD post, so bear (or bull) with me 

(C+C appreciated, as I had a lot of fun researching and writing this) 

Stock Ticker: NVS

Market: NYSE 

Name: Novartis

Category; Pharmaceuticals

Why investigate this stock? 

With the opioid crisis and its ramifications coming into the media spotlight, there has been an increasing body of research into the use of suboxone for treatment of opioid dependence disorder (ODD). For those of you unfamiliar with suboxone, it is a combination of buprenorphine-naloxone. This medication acts as a partial opioid agonist, and the naloxone component helps prevent abuse. In toxicology and ""Medication Assisted Treatment"" circles, it is becoming favored over methadone due to decreased side effect profile and decreased potential for abuse. Recently, some states have significantly expanded training programs so providers can easily obtain an “X waiver”, which is a qualification required for a medical provider to prescribe suboxone. This suggests that it will be increasingly used in Emergency Departments to initiate ODD treatment, and it will see increasing use in the outpatient clinic setting. 

So why Novartis?

For those of you familiar with Suboxone’s history, it is actually made by the drug company Reckitt Benckiser. However, recently they authorized a generic version which is to be distributed by, you guessed it, Novartis (technically a subsidiary Sandoz, but all traded under the ticker NVS)

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:\~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/indivior-launches-generic-suboxone/#:~:text=Share%20Article-,UK%2Dbased%20pharmaceutical%20company%20Indivior%20has%20launched%20a%20generic%20version,drug%20on%20behalf%20of%20Indivior).

I’m not saying that generic suboxone is going to be “the next big thing”, however I think it will be mainstay of ODD treatment moving forward in the US given low cost, increasing ease of access, and low(er) side effect profile when compared to other medications for ODD. (Some of you may remember Vivitrol aka long acting Naltrexone, see the head to head vs suboxone here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32812-X/fulltext))

Now let’s look into some aspects of the stock itself. 

P/E Ratio: \~ 24 

S/p 500 P/E: \~ 34 

I like to look at the P/E ratio as a good starting point to see if the stock is over/under valued compared to its earnings. This can suggest the ability to weather downturns in a market that trends towards over-valuing stocks compared to their real world earnings. 

Next, the relative strength index (RSI). For those of you unfamiliar it is a momentum indicator (I have my own opinions on momentum investing, which I can talk about in a different post). Whether you fall on the side of a value investor or a momentum investor, I think it’s an interesting index to take a look at for any stock, and can help you “time” your purchase. **Remember, there is no end all be all market index.** Regardless, the RSI was developed in 1978 and evaluates price changes to determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI is listed from 0-100, with a value < 30 suggesting that a stock is undervalued, and should be bought. A value > 70 suggests a stock is overvalued and should be sold. If you’re interested, take a look into how it is calculated to see why a higher RSI suggests overvalue. 

Anyways, the RSI of Novartis as of this post is 54.4, with a steady trend upwards since February. So what does that suggest? Basically that it is neither overbought or oversold, but has a trend towards being overbought, which doesn’t help us much. . 

Here’s a few good resources to check RSI on stocks you’re interested in: 

[https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab\_name=rsi](https://aiolux.com/reports/analytics-technical-indicators?symbol=NVS&tab_name=rsi)

[https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563](https://www.profitspi.com/stock/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563)

Looking at the financials of NVS for Q4, they are reassuring. 

See here for financial stats, but they can easily be googled otherwise: 

[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/NVS:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW0N377vPvAhXVVs0KHekcCSgQ3ecFMAB6BAgZEBo)

The company demonstrated strong Q4 performance, with increases in Revenue, Net Income, and Profit Margins. However, using the golden rule that **past performance is not indicative of future performance** (except when one takes advantage of specific aspects of momentum investing, again to be discussed in a later post), I would not recommend using financial performance metrics to guide purchases (especially in highly volatile markets), but they do give you a snapshot of the company’s current financial environment. 

Above I’m suggesting that generic suboxone will likely provide a value to the company overtime, as suboxone gains prominence in treatment of ODD. However, what else is NVS up to? 

COVID 19

No covid 19 therapeutics, however Novartis is assisting Pfizer and CureVac in production capacity. Specifically, they will be assisting in filling the vials. I don’t think this will contribute much financially, but it’s good PR, and lets face it good for human kind. 

Current Pharmaceuticals

Novartis is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, so I’m not going to go into an exhaustive list of their products. You can find them on the wikipedia page here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis#Pharmaceuticals)

However, many of their drugs have good staying power. Of note, they make Entresto, an Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibitor. For my renal nerds out there take a look at the mechanism, really awesome stuff.. There was a lot of buzz in the medical community about Entresto a few years back. This NEJM trial was huge, showing that the Angiotensin-Neprilysin inhibition was superior to Enalapril in reducing risks of death and hospitalization. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor medication which has become a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1409077)

Digital Health

Novartis recently partnered with Science 37, who has developed an interesting system for virtual clinical trials. COVID 19 was a catalyst for digital health, and I think companies that provide telehealth platforms are going to continue to grow. Many patients love the telehealth option, and often opt for it over an in-person visit for many smaller medical issues/checkups. 

Clinical Trials 

As a large pharmaceutical company, Novartis has a well established clinical pipeline for research. I find that betting on the “next big thing” or breakthrough in therapy is typically a losing bet, especially because you have no idea what the results will be as molecular therapies and typical pharmaceuticals go through the rigorous phases of clinical trials. It is a better to bet on a company that has a lot of experience bringing products to market, with a large research pool to pull from. This article has a great table demonstrating the “success rates” of various drug classes coming to market: 

[https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:\~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate](https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/11/clinical-trial-success-rates-phase-and-therapeutic-area-14845#:~:text=As%20shown%2C%20the%20overall%20probability,have%20a%2033.4%25%20success%20rate).

(Spoiler: It’s not good) 

Overall, NVS has demonstrated steady growth, and is a huge pharmaceutical manufacturer. They have a large pool of research and will be responsible for the generic version of Suboxone, which I believe will have a strong role in treatment of ODD moving forward in the opiate crisis. The technicals on NVS are pretty middle of the road, with a reassuring P/E ratio and a dead center RSI. I think it would be a good value investment in the long term, but short term gains may be difficult. 

Finally, what I think is appropriate for the end of all DD posts, is that this isn’t me telling you to buy or sell this stock. Rather, I’ve compiled some information about the company that should be a starting point for your own research and evaluation",['PFE']

mobmuc,,investing,post,1618084019,"Smith & Nephew (SNN) - Sports injury/hip-replacement play still over 20% discounted from CovidI don't regularly make posts about individual securities...actually this would be my first. I'm tired of daily DD posts on companies that are at ATH, so here's a mini-DD on one that is still heavily discounted from Covid. And of course...this is not investment advice, do your own due diligence.

Let's look at where they made their business in 2020:

- $1.9 billion in revenue in orthopedics: mainly knee implants, hip implants, & trauma devices.

- $1.3 billion in sports medicine

- $1.3 billion in wound management

So we have a company that makes most of their revenue in sports, injuries, and hip/knees. Literally all things that were put on halt due to Covid. As to be expected, 2020 was a terrible year for them, with revenue down 11.2% and EPS down 25%. They also under-performed all their larger peers (i.e. Striker, Zimmer Biomet) whom thanks to more diversified products were not hit as hard.

I believe most of their under-performance is due to events that are transitory:

- Decline in sports injuries due to Covid.

- Postponement of knee/hip surgeries due to Covid.

- Brexit (they are a UK company)

- Inability to effectively run their sales due to Covid & lockdowns.


Let's look at some headwinds that I think the market is not factoring in:

- They have actually increased their R&D budget by nearly 5% during Covid, while most other device companies are tightening.

- The UK is planning to increase corporate taxes to 25% in 2023, however they will have a temporary 130% super-deduction for plant/equipment through March 2023. Meanwhile, UK plans no change to their 13% credit on R&D. I believe SNN, a device manufacturer, will be an out-sized beneficent of this change in tax policy.

- Potential buyout opportunity from one of the larger device makers.

Finally, SNN's debt looks reasonable, and Price/Sales ratio is literally almost at the same spot it was in 2014/2015..a rarity in this market. And their revenue growth has slowly climbed from $3.8 billion in 2008 to $5.1 billion in 2019, only falling down to $4.5 billion in 2020. So 2020 was, other than a small drop in 2012, the only year they had a major decline in revenue.

If it's not clear by now I am long SNN. I purchased after Covid and planning for a long term hold...now I'm waiting for schools to re-open, sports to come back in full force, and for people to get injured again rather than sit at home in their bubble. It's only a matter of time before people are playing hockey, or recreational soccer.

**Wrestlemania 37** (WWE) is this weekend and returning with a live audience. One of the marquee matches: Big E vs Apollo Crews in a Nigerian Drum Fight. I don't know exactly what a Nigerian Drum Fight is, but I smell $$$ for the sports-injury device company Smith+Nephew.",['ZBH']

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016441/ea137987ex99-1\_industrial.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016441/ea137987ex99-1_industrial.htm)

\-A soon to be named auto company is entering a deal with Arbe that will result in 300 million in sales for one model, and could account for 10x (3 billion) in sales for more models.

\-The auto company is likely a US company because it is described as “Western” while the OEM described next to this mystery Western company in the presentation is described as “European”(If it’s a Western and not European, it’s likely a US company) *(\*See investor presentation slide 22)*

\-Elon Musk is quoted in the Arbe investor presentation - “Lidar is doomed” (\*Agree or disagree with Musk feeling this way today, the company is making a point in their presentation about the value of their \~$100 radar on chip IP outperforming the Lidar tech that can costs $1,000’s)

\-Arbe is a “First Mover” and “Market Leader” in 4D imaging radar technology-(Slide 16). This positions them to be chosen first to take the place of traditional radars in the exact same slot that is already built in for radar use, but can now be used for 4D imaging radar chips.

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# What new customer/company fits the description of the largest new deal?

**Customer description #1 -** It is “One of the largest automobile companies in the **world”** *(\*See the Arbe CEO’s merger webcast))*

**Customer description #2 -** It is a “Leading, Global, Western” company\*-(presumably not with a homebase in Europe for reasons described above\*\*\*)\*\* *(\*See Investor presentation slide 22)*

**Company that meets both descriptions** **=** One of the US’s “Big Three” -- **General Motors $GM, Ford $F, or Chrysler/Stellantis $STLA** *\*Although there are no guarantees that it will be one of these 3, there are not many other companies that fit both above descriptions given by Arbe*

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Who is Arbe Robotics / $ITAC and what do they do?

\-$ITAC recently merged with Arbe Robotics to create a publicly traded company

\-Their product is the first and only available long-range, 4D Imaging Radar (so little to no competition)

\-Their 4D Imaging Radar:

\>Is used in personal cars, trucking, delivery, industry, agriculture, mining, etc. \*(Primary / most profitable focus is the automotive industry)

\>Is needed for every level of vehicle autonomy (Tier 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

\>Supposedly outperforms Lidar and Cameras, especially in fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and other poor conditions (see performance details below)

\>Fits in the same slot that current, old radars fit in, but their radar provides over 100x better quality, and a 4th dimension, allowing you to “see” objects in a new way

# Is Arbe’s technology a “disruptor” with a large market opportunity?

1. Qamcom’s CEO explains why Arbe’s technology is a disruptor that supersedes existing alternatives - “Choosing Arbe as a partner was an obvious choice since there is no other radar chipset solution on the market that is comparative,” said Johan Lassing, chief executive officer of Qamcom. “Traditional or contemporary radar solutions don’t solve the challenges that autonomous vehicles face. Arbe revolutionized radar by creating a sensor that provides a never-before-seen image which is close to the image that vision based sensors achieve that also has the properties of radar – Arbe’s 4D Imaging Radar Solution has the potential to be the primary sensor candidate for the sensor suite of any autonomous and semi-autonomous applications and next generation perception platforms.”
2. The CEO says their new 4D Visual Radar technology is designed to fit in the same spot as existing radars, making it immediately usable by auto companies[ ](https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/173-noam-arkind-arbe-robotics/id1353975287?i=1000501753796)
3. The 4D Imaging Radar is suitable for every level of vehicle autonomy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
4. Already has “key partnerships” with Nvidia, Valeo, Denso, and other reputable/large companies involving their radar-on-chip technology (\*See slide 9 of investor presentation)
5. The technology can be used outside of cars - e.g. mines, agriculture, trucking, delivery, more -[ ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/qamcom-will-bring-arbes-4d-imaging-radar-to-trucks-mines-and-farms/)
6. CEO claims their main competitor is Mobileye (\*Mobileye was bought out by Intel for $15 million). CEO claims Mobileye will have a chipset in 2025 that is similar to what Arbe already has today (\*See investor webcast link below)
7. Resolution and performance supersedes all existing radar technology[ ](https://www.embedded.com/imaging-radar-development-platform-offers-2k-resolution/)
8. The Arbe CEO explains their IP value “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""

# Valuation/Profitability considerations

\-Arbe CEO said “We believe that the gross profit and the gross margins of this business are attractive, more than 65%. This is because -- this is not just silicon. These are real algorithms, real IP-embedded on our chipset and we believe that we're going to maintain those margins for the long run as well as high EBITDA margins and free -- very good free cash flow.""[ https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc\_src=social-sh&soc\_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&\_\_twitter\_impression=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/qamcom-arbe-collaborate-bring-power-150000097.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr&__twitter_impression=true)

\-The Arbe CEO says ""When Mobileye passed $300 million in revenue, the figure that we are expecting for 2025, Intel bought them for $15 billion.”

\-The Spac transaction values Arbe at a low $572 million enterprise value, implying only a 1.8x multiple on 2025 forecasted revenue and a 4.4x multiple on 2025 forecasted pro forma Adjusted EBITDA \*This presumably does not account for new or unexpected deals that may arise of the 10 auto companies they are currently in final stage talks with, or the company referred to as “one of the largest auto companies in the world”

\-ITAC/Arbe has a small, 7.7 million share public float which could move quickly when catalysts are revealed (\*Institutional elements of the non-public float include a PIPE paid for by respected “strong hand” institutional investors such as M&G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures, and Eyal Waldman-(founder and CEO of Mellanox Technologies $MLNX))

\-The institutional portion of the float is unlikely to sell - “What matters is not the price or the valuation at the time of the flotation, but in the long term; especially when the **holdings of all the existing shareholders are vested for at least a year**, so you don't sell in a hurry“[ ](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-has-more-unicorns-than-all-of-europe-1001366171)

\-The CEO recently recommended that shareholders hold shares until they reach a $15 billion dollar market cap-(This is his 3rd company and he believes this company will reach that)(\*This source is described as “Israel's largest and most popular news and content website”) -[ ](https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5907598,00.html)

# Stock details

\-Common shares are trading around NAV at the time of this post

\-Warrants are redeemable with typical SPAC rates: 1 for 1 at an 11.50 strike price, with a 5 year expiration (redeemable only if the common SP stays above $18 for 20 of 30 trading days)

**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

# Summary

Arbe developed and patented a new type of 4D radar imaging technology that negates the need for expensive lidar and vastly improves existing camera/radar performance (over 100x better than existing radar). Arbe is the “first mover” in the market, with little to no competition. The new 4D imaging radar fits in the same slot in a car that the older radar technology uses, making the transition easy for auto companies. The total market for the product includes all Tiers of vehicles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

The price was designed to be virtually the same as existing radars-($100 per unit, $150 for premium), and is drastically more affordable than paying $1,000’s for lidar. Arbe’s 4D radar vastly outperforms the more expensive Lidar in many conditions such as fog, rain, dust, glare, dark, and more, making it indispensable for both ADAS and autonomous applications.

\*Value will be confirmed by catalyst/deals soon, as the CEO has many quotes describing deals they are signing to be publicized shortly (see above).

mo18p6,gu1m10u,investing,comment,1618064068,"I am in my mid-thirties, been investing since my late twenties in a Roth IRA with Vanguard, doing monthly (now weekly) buys of an appropriate Target Retirement Fund. It's 90% stocks, 10% bonds. 

I feel comfortable with a 100% stocks allocation at this point (still 30 years off from retirement) and am considering exchanging all my Target Retirement shares for VTSAX shares, which will hopefully do better for me in the long run (I would continue my weekly investments in VTSAX for the future).

 I am only nervous because it would be the largest single transaction I've ever made, so I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake!

1. My personal risk appetite aside, is there any reason not to do this?
2. Is there a specific time I should aim to do this? (It seems everything is at a high right now, but does it mean anything?)
3. I'm pretty sure there are no fees associated with an exchange like this. Is that true?

SIDE NOTE: I opened a SEP-IRA so I can contribute some of my small business (sole proprietorship) income to this, since I'll be maxing out my Roth IRA. Should I aim to contribute to a different fund (i.e. not whatever my Roth is contributing to)?

Thanks for the information.",
mo18p6,gu202wp,investing,comment,1618071186,"Tax question here. It's surprisingly hard to find this info from googling!

Say I buy $1k of $ABC, it goes up to $10k, and I sell it all. I owe taxes on $9k. Now I turn around and buy $10k of $DEF. It tanks, and I sell at $1k to break even. Do I still owe taxes on the $9k profit? Or do I owe taxes on $6k of that $9k profit (there's a $3k max loss deduction, no)?

Similarly, take the same situation but say I change my mind about selling, and buy back in the next day for the same price and amount of what I sold it for. It then tanks and I sell it for the exact same price and amount as I originally bought in for with that $1k. Do I owe taxes on any of that?

The current valuation of $10B dwarfs the $4B it was valued at in a private funding round in 2020, and at approximately $1B more than Beyond Meat. This is despite the fact that BYND brought in 400M in FY revenue compared to Impossible Meat's 150M estimated annual revenue.

The [Pi Cycle Top Indicator](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/pi-cycle-top-indicator/) (warning - terrible on mobile) has historically been effective in picking out the timing of market cycle highs to within 3 days.
It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2.

Note: The multiple is of the price values of the 350DMA not the number of days.

For the past three market cycles, when the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking.

It is also interesting to note that 350 / 111 is 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. In fact, it is the closest we can get to Pi when dividing 350 by another whole number.

It once again demonstrates the cyclical nature of Bitcoin price action over long time frames. Though in this instance it does so with a high degree of accuracy over the past 7 years.

IMO, indicators like these are likely to be only coincidental, although, it’s past accuracy warrants it’s significance. It must be taken into account as well as all previous tops have been blow off tops rather than an Elliott wave ending diagonal (if bitcoin is topping right now). This discrepancy may reduce its accuracy.

However, [my own personal amateur TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/DAn0UXkz-Bitcoin-close-to-Macro-Top/) seems to share a bearish stance. (Note- TA is from early February but trend lines have not been broken so it is still relevant) [Sentiment](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/relative-unrealized-profit--loss/) also seems to be in the ballpark of previous macro tops. 

Having said this, I am only an amateur and i wouldn’t put much stock into my opinion. It is most likely flawed and history has shown it is incredibly hard to predict the pops of bubbles. I could easily see bitcoin exploding to 100k next week. I would not be surprised at all. I am just urging cautiousness, please be sure to set stop losses.",

Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.

“I  have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge  deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a  successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S.  economy will likely boom,” the [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) chief executive officer said Wednesday in his [annual letter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QR6VNCMEQTXC) to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”

Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted  unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to  Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help  communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S.  stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed  well in stress tests, he said.

Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus  checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them  in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary”  amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of  quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in  deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.

It could all add up to  a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and  sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome  include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that  prompts rates to rise sooner.

At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global  banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan  of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the  end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a  major bank through the financial crisis.

The 65-page letter (plus a  page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s  abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work  from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on  topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and  institutional racism.

### Competitive Threats

Dimon,  who built the biggest and most profitable U.S. bank in history, also  warned shareholders that his industry’s disruption by technology is  finally at hand. Shadow lenders are gaining ground. Traditional banks  are being consigned to a shrinking role in the financial system.

“Banks have enormous competitive threats -- from virtually every angle,” he said. “Fintech and Big Tech are here… big time!”

The  letter expands on predictions Dimon has offered for years, this time  declaring many of those threats have now arrived. Financial-technology  firms are more formidable, offering easy-to-use, fast and smart  products, he said. Shadow banks -- a group that includes investment  funds and online platforms offering financing to companies and consumers  -- are winning market share too.

Those groups have outpaced the  growth of banks by some measures, often thanks to less regulation. They  have also done “a terrific job in easing customers’ pain points” with  slick online platforms, he said.

“While I am still confident that  JPMorgan Chase can grow and earn a good return for its shareholders, the  competition will be intense, and we must get faster and be more  creative,” the CEO wrote. “Acquisitions are in our future, and fintech  is an area where some of that cash could be put to work.”

As  with previous annual letters, Dimon touched on geopolitical issues. On  Brexit, he said that uncertain financial regulations coupled with  political pressure may lead to a “tipping point many years out when it  may make sense to move all functions that service Europe out of the United Kingdom and into continental Europe.”

Dimon  mentioned China more than 30 times throughout the letter, predicting it  will probably overtake the U.S. in the next 20 years as the biggest  economy and financial market. He lauded China’s growth over the last 40  years but said the country will have to confront serious issues in the  next 40, including pollution, corruption and inefficiency.

“China does not have a straight road to becoming the dominant economic power,” Dimon said. “For the near term, if China and the United States  can maintain a healthy strategic and economic relationship, it could  greatly benefit both countries – as well as the rest of the world.”

He  also touched on the bank’s future need for real estate, expecting it to  drop significantly as remote working outlasts the pandemic. The bank  could require some 60 seats for every 100 employees as some staff work  under a hybrid model, he said. The lender still intends to build its new  headquarters in New York City, he added.

Despite a warning just two days ago from Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell that corporate leaders should refrain from taking stances on  divisive political issues, Dimon waded into areas including immigration,  health care and education.

“Our problems are neither Democratic  nor Republican -- nor are the solutions,” Dimon wrote. “Unfortunately,  however, partisan politics is preventing collaborative policy from being  designed and implemented, particularly at the federal level.”

### ‘Terribly Wrong’

For all the brightness in his economic outlook, Dimon found cause for far darker laments.

The  pandemic has thrust profound inequities and their devastating effects  into the spotlight. On issues such as health care and immigration,  people have lost faith in the government’s ability to solve problems, he  said.

“Americans know that something has gone terribly wrong, and  they blame this country’s leadership: the elite, the powerful, the  decision makers -- in government, in business and in civic society,” he  wrote. “This is completely appropriate, for who else should take the  blame?”

That fuels populism on the right and left, he said. “But  populism is not policy, and we cannot let it drive another round of poor  planning and bad leadership that will simply make our country’s  situation worse.”

The CEO even put it in economic terms: He estimates  wide-ranging “dysfunction” has cut a percentage point off the U.S.  growth rate. He suggested studying solutions abroad, pointing to  apprenticeship programs in Germany, health care in Singapore and  infrastructure in Hong Kong.

Dimon also reiterated a call for a  national Marshall Plan, referring to the U.S. effort to help Western  Europe recover from World War II, to address the structural challenges  behind the country’s racial and economic crises.

“Fixing America’s  problems is going to take hard work. But if we divide them into their  component parts, we will find many viable solutions,” he said. “With  thoughtful analysis, common sense and pragmatism, there is hope.”",['JPM']

Still, despite this, Naspers for years traded at a substantial discount. Mutual fund FPA Crescent tried a long Naspers short Tencent trade for a long time (just owning Tencent would have been a better idea.) In an attempt to narrow that discount, they spun out the Tencent stake and the other tech investments into Prosus, which (last I looked) still trades at a discount.

Prosus sold 2% and still owns around 28% of Tencent. Also, ""It also promised not to sell any further Tencent shares for at least the next three years."" (https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html)

mn9mjt,,investing,post,1617942867,"[DD] Bull or Bear: Nano X Imaging (NNOX)General disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

---

**Let's cover the basics**
---

Nano X Imaging (NNOX) is an x-ray machines design company. They are currently purely an R&D company with hopes of producing the NANOX.ARC x-ray machine, a low-cost solution for standard x-rays. They have already presented working prototypes of this machine.

**Another x-ray machine? So what....**

The main innovation in NNOX is the cost of their x-ray machine. By utilizing a technology called cold-cathode, they are able to drastically reduce the cost of the most expensive pieces of standard x-ray equipment (for digital x-rays). Thus, they hope to compete in this space with a price advantage, manufacturing their solution at $10,000 ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/06/why-is-nano-x-imaging-stock-soaring/)).

**What does it mean to compete in this space?**

The global market for x-ray machines is $13.1B and expected to grow to $20B by 2027 ([source](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/medical-x-ray-market)). Most of this growth is expected to be captured by hospitals and diagnostic centers as x-rays expand its role in the medical field:

https://imgur.com/lEB50J7

Currently, the average digital x-ray machine runs at ~$150K ([source](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-portable-x-ray#:~:text=Hospitals%20with%20an%20existing%20analog,and%20type%20of%20detector%20selected.)). Because NNOX x-ray machines don't bring anything new to the table, the only value it provides will be how cheaply it can depress its prices. Its current business model is to lose money on the x-ray machine (selling it for under $10K) but make that money back in a subscription model ($40 per x-ray with $14 going to NNOX) ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)).

**Basically, they are trying to be the Gillette of x-ray machines. Sell their product at a loss, but make it all up with subscription revenue.**

---

**NNOX has exciting sales claims, but are they real?**
---

NNOX claims that they are pricing a $2M machine for $10K. This is mostly a lie as modern day digital x-ray machines run at $150K, not $2M. So, if this is a lie, what else is?

**Who the hell even wants cheaper NNOX machines?**

First of all, let's see if NNOX makes sense for hospitals. We're going to calculate how many x-rays the hospital should give per day in order to recoup the cost of purchasing a new x-ray machine versus using NNOX's x-ray machine. Hold on tight because we're about to do some... *simple math*.

(150,000 - 10,000) / 40 = 3500 x-rays total

3,500 / 365 = ~10 x-rays per day.

Thus, for a single year, a hospital must use their new x-ray machine 10 times per day at least for this to be a cost effective solution. Given that x-ray machines usually have a lifecycle of 4-6 years, this number is further reduced.

3,500 / 365 / 4 = ~2.5 x-rays per day.

So, if a hospital does at least 3 x-rays per day, they would rather use their own x-ray machine rather than NNOX. So, wtf? According to NNOX, the low estimate of a hospitals usage of x-ray machines is 7 per day while its high estimate is 20 ([source](https://investors.nanox.vision/static-files/3d876f49-a4d5-4cce-b9ff-8bfbad49e2b3)). Already, this financial decision doesn't make any sense. So, why would anyone buy a NNOX x-ray machine?

Simply put, we're not considering all the costs. Within NNOX's subscription model, it includes the software to manage the x-rays as well as maintenance and installation of the machines. With a standard  x-ray machine, you'll be paying for installation, maintenance, and software which more than doubles the price of the x-ray machine. That combined with the fact that businesses don't like their cash sunk into high-cost assets (depreciation is a b*****) and suddenly, you have a legitimate business case to use NNOX x-ray machines over the current day standard.

**What kind of sales is NNOX expecting?**

NNOX is hoping to deploy 15,000 units by 2024 ([source](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/11/09/nano-x-imaging-ltd-nnox-q3-2020-earnings-call-tran/)). To that end, they already have ~10,000 machines in pre-deployment stages. 5000 machines are contingent on approval in 9 countries. Another 5000 is under negotiation in US, Korea, and Vietnam.

Wow, they are already 2/3 of the way to their 2024 sales goals!

Not quite so fast. Pre-deployment is the same as pre-orders. They are non-binding expressions of interest by companies. While some of these pre-orders will certainly fall flat, I do expect many of them to pull through as well. There are some very legitimate businesses who have signed up for NNOX x-ray machines:

- SPI: one of Mexico's top Pharma companies

- USA-RAD: a company 25% owned by Siemens Healthineers (a $18B in sales US company)

- Golden Vine: a Taiwan company owned by one of the most influential business families in Taiwan (Liao)

Also, please note that while NNOX's end user is hospitals and diagnostic centers, their primary *customer* is not. Their business model utilizes already established supply chains with many hospital contacts to purchase their machines in bulk before reselling to hospitals. This is the same strategy that fleet vehicle sales employs.

There are a number of other pre-order customers as well, but it mostly follows the same logic. A lot of their current pre-orders are from legitimate businesses which I believe are serious about following through with the order if NNOX's product can deliver.

**Beyond their sales, they have key partners to bolster their legitimacy**

Take a look at some of their strategic partners. You will instantly recognize some of the names:

https://imgur.com/qAu58ut

The biggest names on this list is probably:

- SK Telecom: South Korea's big 4 telecommunications company. They have their hands in near everything. Think Google of South Korea.

- Foxconn: Everybody knows the infamous Foxconn. While I can't vouch for the health of their factory workers, they are damn good at manufacturing and can easily scale any product (usually at the cost of the health of their workers).

**However, there is some controversy around their claims**

There have been various short reports claiming that NNOX is a fraud. Both Muddy Waters ([source](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/nnox/mw-is-short-nnox/)) and Citron Research ([source](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1G6CGHXVYZbIZ8JOHF_WSf086xY3guvTKBYaFwlmSnu-XJSv9zLrgJm-I)) released scathing reports, concluding that the true price of NNOX is $2 and $0. That's right $0. However, since the reports have come out, various other people have widely disputed the short reports' claims. DKA, a consortium of global technology companies, for example, wrote a counter short report ([source](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging)) and there has been much backlash in other financial communities like Motley Fool ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/27/why-are-people-shorting-nano-x/)).

The arguments are as follows:

- Shorters believe that NNOX is too good a story to be true. They invested ~$8M to produce NNOX.ARC and they're going to disrupt a $20B industry? Ridiculous. Furthermore, some of their pre-order customers are sketchy and may not be legitimate. Lastly, there (at the time) was no proof that NNOX's product worked at all.

- Counter-argument claims that low investment is not a barrier for impossibility. They also went through NNOX's customer pre-orders and proved that many of them were, in fact, legitimate. Lastly, NNOX personally went to a radiology conference to prove that their prototype worked.

Personally, I think that the short reports have been proven wrong and the market seems to agree as well.

---

**Okay, /u/jraywang, I didn't read any of this, just tell me if NNOX is fairly valued or not!**
---

Calm your tits, internet person. We're getting to that.

NNOX has a current valuation of $2B. The industry they play in is worth $20B per year. Though there are tertiary services and business models, we'll stick with these 2 numbers for now. The multiple for earnings in this sector are as follows ([source](https://www.gurufocus.com/industry_overview.php?sector=Healthcare&region=USA)):

- Healthcare: 26

- Healthcare Devices: 53

Therefore, in order for NNOX to have a fair valuation currently, their **earnings** should be between $40M and $75M, which is entirely possible within a $20B industry. There's no information regarding their profit margins, so let's just assume they have a 25% profit margin (I literally made this number up. If someone can find a suitable replacement, you should use it).

Going to some of the agreements already negotiated, Promedica Bioeletronics has agreed to pay $13.5M per year for 500 NNOX machines. Extrapolating this out, every 1000 in per unit sales should provide NNOX $26M in revenues and $6.5M in profits. Now, given that we believe 15,000 unit sales is realistic given their current conditions, this would equate to $100M in annual revenues! This is much higher than the $40M expected if they were judged as a healthcare device company and the $75M expected if they were to be judged as a healthcare company. Therefore...

**Best case scenario, we see 150% upside. Worse case scenario, we see 33% upside.**

However, this is IF they can achieve their 15,000 of target sales.

**But can their balance sheet survive until they reach their sales targets?**

Short answer: yes. NNOX has a great balance sheet ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNOX/balance-sheet/)). With $240M in cash and no immediate debts, I see no reason for them to dilute their shares for financing. Their operating cash flow is currently at -$6M which means they can operate under their current balance sheet for 40 years. This is insane.

---

**In conclusion...**
---

**NNOX is a bull case**. They have an extremely healthy balance sheet with minimal loss in cash flow. Moreover, their initial sales estimates look realistic and their revenues look promising. They have multiple strategic partners that are both legitimate, powerful, and influential. Their current valuation seems to still be suffering from short reports that are most likely flawed.

I would have a price target of NNOX at $50 (for the risk adverse) - $100 (if you truly believe).","['GOOGL', 'WAT']"

This seems extremely expensive in the PACS/RIS space.

edit:
So, for folks who haven't worked in this industry, here's a normal radiology workflow:

1. Your doctor orders a study be done.
1. Scheduling dept creates a work order/appointment in their RIS (radiology information system). This is usually integrated into the HIS (hospital information system) of the Hospital that the DR is affiliated to/has admitting privileges to.
1. Patient shows up for their xray, so they get checked in on the RIS. 
1. Rad tech pulls up the work order on the RIS, preps the patient, and takes photos with the ""modality"" - what people in the industry call things like XRay machines, CT scanners, Ultrasound machines, nuke med machines, and so on. This is basically the ""camera takes photos"" portion. The modality is the camera. They produce photos that can either be printed to film (in the old days) or more likely get digitally transferred into a PACS (Picture Archive and Communication System). This company makes cameras, basically. They don't make the photos, they don't make the photo album.
1. The study shows up for the radiologist to read in the PACS. They read it and dictate their findings in the PACS.
1. The dictation shows up in a worklist for a transcriptionist to transcribe into the medical record in the PACS or RIS.
1. The radiologist checks and approves the transcription in the PACS.
1. The study is made available to the requesting doctor with the findings, and the patient gets appropriate treatment.

So out of this entire multistep workflow, this company only seems to make the camera portion. This portion is not usually done as an ""as a service"" since these are huge $6-$8 figure machines, that can require tens of thousands to millions to even get installed. 

Support contracts may be based off of quantity of studies performed, but they're not charging 35% of dang price of every single study. That's absurd. There'd be no incentive to move away from plate + film printing since it would cost more in fees than it would in film doing things ""the old fashioned way"".

That makes me think they're trying to bundle in PACS functionality, but that's absolutely not a good thing. PACS systems are how you store the photos, and retrieve them for viewing, dictating readings, etc.

PACS systems often charge ingestion/storage/viewing fees to access the studies. But even then the pricing is absurd. The PACS system I personally ran charged a few dollars per study, scaling depending on the type (tiny nuke med studies were cheaper than massive mammo studies or gigantic multislice CT scans). XRays are near the low end of the requirements scale. They're just singular pictures, and there's usually only a handful of them. They aren't a ""hot ticket"", which would price them above the competition. 

So, maybe they're relying on the PACS to be *""that good""* - then you've got the issue with PACS/HIS/RIS systems being extremely sticky, and hospitals likely have one already. That means a huge burden to switch.

The medical arena has made it a standard of not having standards. This means any time you attempt to change something, you have to hire specialists called HL7 Programmers to re-implement the gateway systems that translate information between all of these disparate systems and standards. Yes - they made a standard out of the translation system between the standards, rather than implementing a single standard.

The overhead is so massive that many PACS/HIS/RIS vendors will literally give away the modalities and supporting ecosystems to entice customers to switch, figuring they can make it up on support contracts. Modalities like the one this company is making.

There's a massive moat here.

Understanding the career risk professional investors face can help individual investors:** professional investors often become forced sellers due to liquidity concerns, stop-losses, or bumping up against their portfolio’s risk budget.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 19th, 2021.

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
> From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson & Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
> So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
> That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
> # Signs of margin pressures?
> Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
> Utilities was the best performing major S&P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
> Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
> “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
> “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
> While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
> Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
> “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
> But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
> # Searching for hints of inflation
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
> “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
> He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
> The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
> Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
> Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
> “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
> # Economic rebound
> In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
> There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
> “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
> However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
> He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
> “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
> # Watching bonds
> Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
> Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
> “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
> “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

> # Four Reasons The Future Looks Bright For The Bulls

> “I look to the future because that’s where I’m going to spend the rest of my life.” George Burns

> The bull market continues, with the S&P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

> Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

> First, the S&P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&P 500 was up >10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Third, the S&P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

> Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

> After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

> The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

> Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

> # Growth a Market Cap Story

> Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

> That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

> In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

> With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

> # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

> Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

> In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

The implementation will take place within the Jupyter Notebook which we will install using the Anaconda data science platform. So without further introduction lets get into the actual implementation.

mt064o,,StockMarket,post,1618697064,"Futures Trading Part I (Market Commentary and Gold futures) - 4/17/2021Hello investors,

I have been going through a recruiting process and was not able to allocate as much time into the markets recently. You can expect to see less frequent memos going forward as I'm still navigating through the recruiting.

I wanted to discuss two things today.

1. A quick update on the markets, to maintain a big-picture perspective.
2. How to trade bond and gold futures.

**1) A quick update on the markets, to maintain a big-picture perspective.**

Stocks rose to new highs, including S&P, Dow and Nasdaq.

What's notable is that the Nasdaq recovered from its ""rotation from growth to value"" correction.

📷

I mentioned in a series of market commentaries that this NASDAQ dip was most likely another buying opportunity.

3/16: 

3/29: 

What's also noteworthy is that the recovery was different for different types of stocks.

For instance, most of the names I mentioned that I felt bullish about, the growth-oriented ones, have not yet recovered to their previous highs. Examples are the following.

📷📷📷📷📷📷

As I've repeatedly mentioned before, I believe there's a value in buying these growth names at cheaper levels than before. These are businesses with strong moat and proven services trading at relatively reasonable/expensive levels.

Of course they could slip further, which will present yet another buying opportunity. Buying the dip is easy but holding it is the hard part.

**2) How to trade bond and gold futures.**

The reason why I bring this up now, which I should have done months ago, is that I see real opportunities in the two asset classes, specifically gold.

To explain futures a bit, they're really nothing more than leveraged assets.

For instance, similar to how most of the retail investors buy gold through GLD etf, gold futures represent the same thing except your position is 100x levered.

If you bought one GC (gold futures) contract, your exposure is $178,020, because GC closed at $1780.2 on Friday and it is magnified by 100x.

However, you are not actually holding $178k worth of gold futures or spending $178k to buy it. In fact, you just spent zero dollars to get $178k exposure, hence the leverage.

Although you need to maintain certain amount of cash to guarantee the futures position, it is a very minimal amount compared to the $178k exposure you're receiving.

If GC rises by 10%, or $178, then you also gain 10% on your futures, or $17,800, with minimal upfront costs.

On the other hand, if GC declines by 10%, then you also lose 10%, or $17,800.

It's very similar to options in that you get exposure to high amount of delta dollars for low upfront costs.

I personally like the leveraged feature of futures and that's why most investors use it to hedge or optimize their portfolios.

Here's CME's [page](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold_contract_specifications.html) explaining the contract specs.

Similarly, ticker ZB represents 30-year Treasury bond futures. I will explain this in more detail in the next memo.

Looking at GC, gold futures turned positive in recent days and is about to test the 100 MA resistance.

I have a few reasons for gold to benefit from a new bull market. This is a position for the intermediate-term, 1-3 years.

I will walk through the reasons behind gold in the next memo after the recruiting process is over. I just wanted to throw it out there in case anyone wanted to get ahead of their positions before any big upward movements.

msl8o9,,StockMarket,post,1618639203,"dealing with depressionHi All,  


I've started investing a year ago and have had some near opportunities to change my family's life. I had some safe picks, but also bought GME when it was 5 dollars and doge when it was .004. I sold both with a small profit, but seeing how they skyrocketed has me just so angry at myself. I could have changed my family's fortunes and not live with the day to day stress of bills coming in all the time. I've been holding onto stocks that have really been hit hard since Feb. because I don't want to make the mistake of selling again.- but now am dealing with the stress of seeing red every day while the overall market is green. I think I am building better tolerance for the volatility of the market, but when I have moments along, I just want to cry that I messed up so bad and could have done something amazing. How do you all deal with it? Would appreciate your thoughts. Sorry for the depressing post - this is hard for me to write. But I can't really talk to anyone about it.",

msl8o9,guu9kwf,StockMarket,comment,1618661954,"I'm in a similar boat.  I sold 175,000 doge on 4/2 to make a grand with plans to buy another dip, dip never really came, you know the rest....  Paired with another crypto sale around same time I missed out on possibly 90k profit in just 2 weeks (granted that's if I timed right, held longer, and sold at peaks...so not likely).  To make matters worse I've bought back into doge and am in the red as we speak..

Sick to my stomach for last few days simply because of by how close I missed that ride...  But, there will likely be more opportunities (maybe not like this...but still).  Also, you wouldn't be in the position to feel this regret if it wasn't for being successful enough to be in the position in the first place.  You have extra funds to try to make a difference in your family's life...that's rare.  I got some perspective on my situation when I was complaining about this Doge scenario to people that don't even have extra funds to invest in the first place....like they were going to throw a pity party for me. 

And you're right, the added weight and stress of working through these situations is something that most people don't understand and can't handle, and that's what will keep them from ever being able to take advantage of opportunities.  I play poker in games with very large swings and to try to get my spouse to understand the stress of it is near impossible.  Build your resiliency, be ready for next opportunity, and get back up swinging. 

Maybe you're learning that these volatile moves aren't worth the mental anguish, you can make a great deal of difference in your family's life if you simply dollar cost average into a successful index fund....set it and forget it and no stress...  No moonshots, but if you're going to give yourself a heart attack getting there, it ain't worth it anyway...

Finally- I've been telling myself--maybe I'd of made all that money and been inclined to go on a vacation, maybe I'd of gotten in an accident on way to airport or plane crashes or something stupid...never woulda happened if I didn't cash in and make that money!!  It's easy to think of the money that you missed out on, but you never know what negative life changing events could happen if you went on that course....as long as you're still healthy, providing for fam, able to hug the ones you love, and able to get back in there and give it another shot- you're still ahead of the game compared to a lot of people.  Let's commiserate together a little, but keep our chins up man.",
msuh1b,,StockMarket,post,1618678799,"Analysis: Community Health SystemsThis is my first time posting here and my first time combining my education and technical skill set to make a stock pick. Would love some feedback on if this is good analysis, anything I missed, or ways I can improve. Thanks!!

*****THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE*****
I am not licensed or trained in the field of financial advisory/equities. I am just a guy with a computer, an MBA, and a passion for data. I am an amateur. Make decisions based on my research at your own risk. Full transparency: I currently do not have an open position with this company, but will likely open a position.

TL;DR: The technicals indicate Community Health Systems (CYH) stock may be oversold and a deep dive into the company indicates that they are getting back on track after several bad years.

The company:

Community Health Systems is a Fortune 500 company based in Franklin, Tennessee. It was the largest provider of general hospital healthcare services in the United States in terms of the number of acute care facilities. In 2014, CHS had around 200 hospitals, but the number had declined to around 85 in 2021. (source: Wikipedia)

What brought this stock to my attention:
See the chart below. I had set my stock screening script to market caps between 1b and 1t with a max share price of $45. This yielded 1,346 stocks for evaluation. I ended up with about 75 stocks that then met my criteria of meeting a particular RSI threshold or Bollinger percentage. Out of those, this stock jumped out in particular since it hit both the RSI threshold and Bollinger percentage, and is in a field I am familiar with (healthcare - I work for a large hospital system). There were a few pharm-tech/biotech stocks that met my criteria; however, I personally don't like those because they can be so volatile - one clinical trial doesn't yield the results you expect, and the stock craters. This stock is in a more stable industry that I am comfortable with.

Back to the technicals - This stock closed at $10.01 on Friday, which is 17.5% below its 20-day moving average of $12.13. The stock has a Bollinger percentage of .02 and, earlier this month crossed the lower Bollinger band which would have yielded a negative percentage. This is an indicator that the stock may be oversold. Pair this with an RSI below 30 (18.6), we have another indicator that this stock is oversold. Recall, RSIs above 70 indicate overbought stocks, and below 30 indicate oversold stocks. However, RSI is not an accurate price-movement-predictor for all stocks. For this particular stock, RSI has a 55% accuracy of predicting price movement (in my opinion for things like this, over 50% accuracy is good enough, particularly when paired with other indicators).

Beyond the technicals:

Now that I had some technicals to go off of, I did a deeper dive into the company.

The Bad:
-CYH has 12b in long-term debt
-Currently has a negative Book Value to Price Share
-in 2014 CYH operated 200 hospitals, but not operates 85
-Total liabilities is 1.5b more than assets
-Growth is negative at 1.5b

The Good:
-11b in revenue and 16b in assets
-Price to book ratio is below 1 and the PE ratio is 2.29 (average PE for stocks on the S&P sits between 13 and 15)
-CYH has 1.67b in cash on hand which has been a major increase over the last 2 years
-Long term debt is high but trending down
-The balance sheet has improved consistently over the last 3 years.
-CYH has a positive free cash flow
-While growth is negative at 1.5b, growth has continually improved since being -2.14b in 2019
-Total liabilities are trending down
-Has beat earnings estimates for the past 3 quarters (next earnings release is 4/28)

Summary:

As a short-term play, CYH may beat earnings estimates again, and with the technicals indicating the stock being in oversold territory, there may be a small pop in the stock price to take advantage of. However, after diving into the company deeper, reading about the management team, and seeing the improvements over the last 2 years, this could be a good long-term healthcare play as well.",['SPGI']

And because of the inflation it went up again between 1945 - 1948.

&#x200B;

But today's war will not be like in the 1940s. Either we nuke each other or we strangle each other's economy. In other words, commodities shortage. I prefer the latter. So here I am, questioning redditors which you are going to bet pre and during the US-China war.

&#x200B;

Alright, so wheat is a basic commodities to create instant noodles, bread, porridge, cereal. While beef is well you know, a source of protein. Asians eat noodles regularly, Italian eat pasta as well. It's an essential ingredients to create food. Alright, essentials do not mean it has no substitute but supply and demand does not change easily, at least the demand part. So for a time, when the supply drops, the demand will cause a price hike. I am not sure whether this will be good for a noodle company or any company which rely on Wheat.

msgxs1,,StockMarket,post,1618621747,"How margin and short interest rate works for those who are curious.

Short interest and Margin interest is APR and daily rates are based on trading days per year.

There are 365 days/year and 52 weekends that you cant trade on. So that brings the amount of days interest is charged on to 261. (365- 52x2) 

There are also a handful of holidays and other days the exchanges are closed so we will say 11 of those (xmas, 4july, thanksgiving, memorial, etc) so whatever the interest rate is at they are paying you divide that by 250. (261-11).

So lets say interest rate is 20% or .2
We take .2 / 250 = .0008 daily interest.
If the amount you are buying on margin is $10000you will pay $8/day interest. (10000 x .0008) 

If the shares they are shorting are worth fuck lets say 500 million then they will be paying 400k/day interest. (500mil x.0008)

The math equations without numbers look like this. 

APR / TD = DPR   

(EDIT: I was typing this on my phone and put a multiplication sign instead of a division sign thank you to u/bruceismynickname for pointing that out.)

APR= Annual Percentage Rate
TD=trading days
DPR= Daily Percentage Rate.

DPR x CoS =DDO

DPR=Daily Percentage Rate
CoS=  Average Cost of Shares
DDO= Daily Dollars Owed

Now obviously the letters I have used aren’t very mathematically oriented (my math profs would have laughed me out of their offices) but I figured those letters corresponded nicely to what they are meant to represent. If you buy on margin or are interested in finding a rough amount shorters might owe daily these equations can help you with the math.

By Todd C. Frankel

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/



One month after revealing that one child died and others were injured in accidents on Peloton treadmills, the at-home exercise company is fighting a federal safety agency’s request that the company recall the products and has delayed the agency’s investigation into potential safety problems, according to officials familiar with the incident.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission this week took the unusual step of issuing an administrative subpoena to require Peloton to disclose the name of the child who died and the family’s contact information so regulators can continue an inquiry into what went wrong, according to officials who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
The previously undisclosed dispute between the nation’s product safety regulator and Peloton — a $34 billion company famous for its stationary bicycles and online workouts — has so far taken place outside public view.
The two sides also are clashing over whether Peloton’s treadmills need to be taken off the market. The company and regulators have been negotiating this week over the wording and timing of an agency warning to alert consumers to potential dangers posed by the company’s Peloton Tread+ — a $4,300 exercise machine, these officials said. A new safety warning from the CPSC is expected to be posted as early as Saturday, officials said.
“This doesn’t happen with other treadmills,” said an official familiar with the case, explaining why the CPSC was alarmed by reports of victims being pulled under the machines and suffering injuries that included broken bones and head trauma. ""It is a different hazard pattern than is typically seen.”",

Options activity in the sector is turning bullish overall (based on premiums)...

msbrz1,,StockMarket,post,1618604953,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 16, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 16, 2021**

Stocks traded higher on Friday, continuing momentum from yesterday’s record-setting close, with a batch of better-than-expected economic and corporate earnings results fueling the recent rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) set fresh intraday records while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) traded mostly flat. 

According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Skip the advertising lessons you see allover and those so called “I made millions doing this or I turned pennies into riches”... You should frown upon them.

Want to get good at stock market investing and trading? Be hands on. Learn as you go. You loose money, probably a lot of money, but you gain a lot of knowledge. You can mentally structure those loses into as a cost for “Self Taught Knowledge”.. Those loses are investments. They are not losses. Why? Well that money was destined to go somewhere. Either to daily cheeseburgers or someone rip-off instructors.. 

Instead you will be giving it to a market as a loan, knowing sooner or later, you are going to be getting it back with interest at a far higher rate than ever.

Now when you start earning profits from your mistakes, guess what, your head is going to go really up high. Why? You now have pride in achieving 2 major things:

1: Self Taught Skills
2: Earn Money-making 

You and your mistakes are your biggest instructors and your greatest inspiration, and should be your highest motivation.

Keep on riding.

Considering the world’s ambitious infrastructure plans, coupled with clean energy technologies, and pent-up demand for electric vehicles. As a result of this, copper miners will be forced to drastically cut back on operations! But the question is, is there anything to mine?

Copper mining has evolved from primitive, inefficient techniques to lightweight, reliable modern-day machines, making it a cost-effective and efficient operation. sponsored post. Furthermore, modern mining equipment allows for the reduction of waste and the reduction of chemical exposure at all stages of the copper mining operation.

With  the rare earth elements being in demand, acquiring these elements seem  to have rallied significantly. But what is the challenge for attaining  these elements? sponsored post. The extraction of these elements is  complicated by the fact that certain materials are jumbled together in  the ground with a variety of other minerals in varying concentrations.

1. Understand your employer 401k plan and contribute up to getting max employer contribution (it's free money). This could be 3% to 8% of your paycheck, it varies.
2. Save for emergency funds with 3 to 6 month expenses in online savings account (it's preferred due to high-yield but with COVID, it's not as high but better than brick-and-mortar banks). Whichever you feel comfortable is keeping it out of sight for real emergencies.
3. Start your own IRA (Roth or Traditional) to contribute up to $6k/year. You have more control over what you want to invest in. There's an income limit for single/family tax filers if you choose Roth. With Traditional, you can receive tax deductions up to certain income limit.
4. The recommended % to invest I've read is \~15% of your gross income.

I use Fidelity for my own Roth IRA and taxable brokerage account. And I have company Roth 401(k) with Empower (that is actually invested in fidelity s&p 500 fund FXAIX) which I contribute 10% and receive 4% match to my first 5% of contribution.

ms1iui,,StockMarket,post,1618573916,"The Copper Bull Market Thesis Is Taking Shape! A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable! I Believe One Company, Torq Resources, Is Best-Positioned to Outperform&#x200B;

With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the copper market, while focussing on one company, Torq Resources, that I believe is extremely well-positioned to outperform in the current market. As always, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!  

Generally speaking, I am looking at this as a macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market.

**On the demand side**\-  Combination of global infrastructure rebuild with clean energy focus has created a massive demand for electric vehicles. With each EV requiring 4x more copper than gasoline-powered cars (\~180 pounds of copper in *each* EV) and an estimated 125 million EVs on the road by 2030, the demand for copper will steadily increase each year as passenger internal combustion engine vehicles are gradually phased out of production. (1)(2) Additionally, EV charging stations will require \~250% more copper by 2030 to meet those demands. (3)

**On the supply side**\- Covid has forced Copper miners to drastically cut back on operations. What was supposed to be a year of mined supply growth turned out to be the second consecutive year of zero growth.(7)  The gap in copper production, coupled with strong EV demand during the post-pandemic recovery has triggered a major supply problem. Consequently, analysts from several companies have forecasted huge copper price increases (i.e., Citigroup; $12,000 by 2022, Goldman Sachs; $10,500 over the next 12 months, and Trafigura Group, $15,000 over the next decade). (4)(5) 

As new mines take years to come on line (due to finding, permitting, developing, exporting, etc), this results in a relatively small number of companies that actually produce copper or have the potential to produce copper in the current cycle. 

Based on my research, I believe one company is extremely well-positioned to capitalize during this copper bull market. 

**What is Torq Resources?** (TSXV: TORQ) (OTC: TRBMF)

Torq Resources is a copper-gold exploration company focused on prolific mining regions in Chile. Chile produces more than a quarter of the world’s copper, having produced \~5.6 million metric tons of copper from mines in 2019. (6) Torq's management team is extremely well-respected within the industry, having raised over $550 million and monetized successes in two previous exploration companies. 

**Why I Am So Bullish On Torq Resources**

At a very high level. when I am evaluating junior miners, I start my analysis by segmenting into two categories:  


1. Those that reasonably could produce copper at some point
2. Those that probably will not produce

Of all the Junior explorers I have researched, I expect Torq to have the most success.   

The biggest catalyst for this success is the launch of the Margarita Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold (IOCG) project located in northern Chile. This region in northern Chile is well-known for its discovery potential - and, this particular property that Torq acquired has generated considerable excitement from geologists as having huge deposit potential due to the strength of the alteration system, large-scale magnetic targets and the presence of copper oxide mineralization along the southwest flanks. (7)  


Torq is set to begin drilling at Margarita in Q3 2021 and the early indicators could not be more positive. 

  
**Torq Resources Is Technically Attractive**

  
Additionally, from a technical analysis standpoint, Torq Resources is extremely strong. 

Since hitting its low of 30 cents in early 2020, Torq's stock price exploded to \~80 cents. I suspect it will break above double top resistance and rocket to new highs, particularly as the copper supply-demand narrative continues to gain traction in 2021.

As I said at the outset, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree, both as it pertains to the copper market in general, as well as if they too see the huge upside in Torq Resources as I do. 

Additionally, for those similarly interested in Torq Resources, I would ***highly*** encourage you to check out the below website for additional research relating to the company and all of its current initiatives.

mrutmu,,StockMarket,post,1618543435,"Significant Activist Hedge Fund Activity (Last 7 Days)


These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,

mrutmu,guphmzp,StockMarket,comment,1618567738,So buy or sell?,
msi9c9,,StockMarket,post,1618626723,"Am I potentially contributing to a market crash by owning GME stock?I tried posting this in a GME specific subreddit, but didn’t receive the best response and want a more unbiased opinion. 

I own just a few shares of GME stock, but am getting concerned that I am contributing to something that will ultimately lead to a crash in the economy similar to 2008.  I understand that what Citadel and other major HF are doing, and have been doing, is grossly illegal and unethical. However, from what I have been reading the past few days it seems like if GME sky rockets it will cause a major disruption to some of the major financial institutions and could potential domino effect into a recession similar to 2008. I started getting more concerned once I saw that BofA, Goldman, and JP issued billions in bonds, and tbh that frightens me and made me really concerned that it may signal something big coming soon in a bad way for the stock market. 

If you remove the unique scenario with GME would what Citadel, big banks, and any other players are doing still result in this type of economic turmoil in the near term? Am i wearing a tinfoil hat by even thinking this is as big of an issue as I’m making it? 

I just don’t know if I morally justify profiting off something that led to potentially millions of people being financially destroyed. In 2008 my parents, and so many other family members and friends, lost half their 401ks, houses, jobs and so much more. I don’t want to participate in something that could cause that level of hurt.",

msi9c9,guss4hf,StockMarket,comment,1618627337,"you have completely the wrong idea. this is a market CORRECTION if anything. 2008 crisis wasn’t because people like me and you held Volkswagen it’s because people like hedgies shorted the fuck out of something and paid up. Like they should HAVE to. If anything take advantage of this opportunity to make sure your family never has to go through something like that again. This sounds REAL SHILLY, hedgies are fukin and have been fukin the market for years. It’s time they get put in their place. You really think all equity gained through these corrections a-crossed not only GME but other meme stocks such as AMC really are going to be thrown away, used for greed, etc? we are the people do you not understand that? The ones holding GME are holding because they remember 2008 and how fucked it was. This is more than just people trying to get “rich” and no, holding your shares is NOT contributing, the shorts are going to have to pay up regardless. And the market will bleed when this starts. But will be corrected ASAP. By us retailers, banks and institutions for the people. etc. just look at this as a market correction that has been held of for YEARS finally being brought into light, and finally addressed.

ms34rw,,StockMarket,post,1618579652,"Does COIN have a proper transaction fee moat?I'm skeptical of brand new stocks and thought there was a little TOO much hype around Coinbase due to it's Q1 numbers. Nevertheless, when I saw the stock dropping, I decided to get a few shares around $330. 

The main argument I see against Coinbase is their transaction fees and how transaction fees will get more competitive. I have a background in marketing and psychology, so here's why I'm not too worried. 

In marketing psychology, there's something called ""inertia"". Basically, when we're already doing something, it takes a lot of effort for us to change. Most of the time we just leave it the same. For examples, look no further than trial memberships. Companies make massive proffits off giving out 7-day or 30-day trials based on inertia. There's a good chance most people won't cancel after the trial is up, so they make some nice profits. It's the same when you sign up for a newsletter. 

With that being said, it's my opinion that transaction fee competition won't be a huge issue for Coinbase. While they may have to lower theirs a little to be competitive, people aren't taking inertia into consideration. When so many people already have their crypto in Coinbase, I believe their inertia will keep them there rather than trying to save a couple bucks.

If you want to learn a bit more about marketing psychology, inertia and some other concepts, I highly recommend books from the Wharton Business School professor Jonah Berger

mrts5b,,StockMarket,post,1618539703,"$FUBO DiscussuonLooking for a short term and long term opinion on $FUBO. 

I like the company long term, I think if they can execute what they promise they can do very well.

In the last few months, I've been reading all sorts of books on investing and found some I really like but am always looking for new recommendations.

I started reading a lot of books on beginning in investing to understanding the differences between individual stocks and index funds. So far, I've been a huge fan of index funds for the majority of my portfolio. 

From what I've learned from psychology books as well as some books on index funds, it seems like individual stock picking is much riskier, but I'm dabbling in it a little with about 30% of my portfolio. 

It seems like there's no exact way to really tell how much a stock ""should"" be worth, but if you have any good recommendations on books that discuss individual stock picking or any other topics, I'd love to hear about them.

Gain 50x short-term.CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange that runs on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and enables uses to SWAP BEP-20 tokens in a trustless and permissionless manner. The platform is fast, cheap, and user-friendly. CryptoSwap Finance has many features such as farming, staking, and trading exchange that enable users to earn and win tokens. 
That is CryptoSwap in summary. In this article, we will look at the features of CryptoSwap and the problems it solves.

Blockchain and smart chain technology have opened a floodgate of innovation. With BSC, it is now possible to develop decentralized finance projects (daaps) with unique features such as decentralized exchanges (DEX), firming, staking, liquid pools, and lottery, which enable users to earn and win tokens in various ways. CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that offers these features, among others that that enable users to earn higher with the least transaction fee and high transaction speed.

Products:

1. Exchange/Trade Platform
CryptoSwap Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that utilizes automated market-making (AMM) instead of the conventional order book. Users can trade various tokens on the platforms against a liquidity pool (LP). LP providers, who are exchange users, add funds to the liquidity pool and receives LP tokens in return. The tokens can be used to reclaim shares of funds, with a portion of the trading fees. The exchange has an intuitive user interface that even novice traders can use.  

2. Yield Farming and Staking
CryptoSwap Finance enables users to deposit and lock their funds in processes that earn rewards in CryptoSwap Finance Token (CSF), the native token. There are many pools where you can stake your funds. You can earn up to 20 times in reward with the main CSF/BNB pool. You can also stake your CSF tokens to earn a reward in other tokens. You can cash out the rewards or reinvest them. 

3. Lottery
Users can participate in the CSF lottery and earn rewards. To participate, use your CSF tokens to buy the tickets. Each ticket goes for 5 CSF. You can participate with a single ticket or buy more tickets to increase your chances of winning. The jackpot winner, whose ticket digits matches all the lottery number, earns 50% of the entire lottery pool. There is a reward for those whose tickets match 3 or 2 numbers. 

4. Voting
The decision-making in CryptoSwap is done through the voting process. The community members are allowed to propose ideas and vote on them. The cryptocurrency team reviews the proposals, move the ones with strong community support to the core level where the team determines the results, and announce it to the CryptoSwap community.

5. Initial Farm Offering
Users can buy tokens offered by other startup projects in a new sale model – IFO. You can use your CSF-BNB LP tokens to acquire new tokens. After the sales, the project gets BNB tokens, while you get project tokens. CSF tokens equivalent to half the total funds raised are burned.

Final Thought  

The above core features of CryptoSwap enable the users to earn and win more tokens. The users can also directly take part in the voting process to suggest ways of improving the project. CryptoSwap is designed to ensure that the users obtain optimal benefits.

mrngbt,,StockMarket,post,1618518757,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 15, 2021**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 15, 2021**

Stocks jumped on Thursday, with all three major indexes reaching fresh intraday records as market participants digested a much better-than-expected unemployment report and a sharp increase in consumer spending. The S&P 500 is up roughly 5% in the month of April, led primarily by mega-cap technology and financial stocks. 

Today, the economic data released was very promising. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

This is great news on two fronts. First, consumer spending represents 70% of US GDP ([more info here](https://www.thebalance.com/components-of-gdp-explanation-formula-and-chart-3306015#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%20comprises%2070%25%20of,components%20of%20the%20U.S.%20economy.)) and is a key driver of economic growth. GDP is now expected to increase 6.5% in 2021 according to the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-making group. That is sharply higher than the 4.2% forecast made in December of 2020. Second, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members have reiterated that recovery in the labor market “remains uneven and far from complete”. To see a report blow so far past analyst expectation is a great sign the labor market is recovering in tandem with the surge in consumer spending. 

Michael Pearce, senior US economist for Capital Economics said of the consumer report, “What caught our eye was the 13.4% surge in spending on food and drink services, while clothing store sales were up by 18.1%. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, food and drink services sales are down just 5.1%, while clothing store sales are now higher than they were in February 2020. That suggests a combination of loosening restrictions and easing of virus fears linked to the vaccine rollout are driving a rapid return to normalcy.” 

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

In a statement, JNJ said it has been “working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public” and added “In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe.” During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&J vaccine review would likely take “days to weeks, rather than weeks to months”, in order to resolve.” Despite the setback with JNJ, distribution of the vaccine remains strong in the US, with the CDC reporting more than 3 million doses being distributed per day.

msb6mb,guvxdhh,wallstreetbets,comment,1618686142,"Looking for some feedback from the weekend people.

I've been thinking about the whole megathread thing for a while. I think when we make long-term megathreads we end up creating a silo of users that can be out of sync with the rest of the sub.

I stickied a comment in the non-gme daily two days ago about how we were going to cut down on spammy GME-related content, that was upvoted fairly vigorously. Meanwhile, the comment ending the gme daily thread was downvoted to oblivion (earning me an inciteful comment trophy) and drew a lot of flak from other subs, was seen as a betrayal, proof of selling out, etc.

To me, that says that we have two large groups of users and they're congregating in different threads, yet they're forced to share the same submission queue. That can't be ideal.

In the future we think we're going to declare megathreads more sparingly and give them an expiration date up front so nobody is surprised and so we don't create more compartmentalization.

msy7zx,,wallstreetbets,post,1618690626,"Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DDI’m going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of “retail gods”.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday’s Hindenburg’s fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg’s allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn’t catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let’s say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let’s assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don’t check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let’s assume that half of them even won’t notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and “diamond handers”. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That’s only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone’s account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won’t take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let’s calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it’s mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it’s impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it’s possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven’t lost you half way through. 

I won’t go into any CLOV fundamentals or any of that good stuff cause I think we already established that everything is in order there. It is also completely irrelevant in a mathematical squeeze.",['TSLA']

Howdy degenerates!

I bet you saw the price action in $CLOV yesterday (+20%)? Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.

What??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.

These hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:

[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)

Their weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.

Isn’t $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math. I think this will unfold whether or not we take part in it.

**$CLOV Short Interest:**

$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do yesterday. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to counter S3 Partners data (although S3 calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:

https://preview.redd.it/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e

[This includes CEO's shares in the float -- it shouldn't. ](https://preview.redd.it/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)

Shorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:

* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil
* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)
* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July
* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell

***What does this mean?***

What this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma fairy dust to make $CLOV move A LOT.

**Timing:**

Timing this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any other good news, this would be our catalyst.

To capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.

Inducing some gamma fairy dust so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.

Remember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation à la Archegos.

Obligatory: I am a financial degenerate and this is for entertainment purposes only.

CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,” they said, concluding, “stick with this top performing ARK ETF.”

Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.

It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

&#x200B;

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

&#x200B;

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

&#x200B;

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

Let's look at her track record : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on ""INNOVATION"" is obviously her success or stock market secret.

&#x200B;

What’s the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

""For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains"".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

# TL;DR

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**  

* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**  

* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**  

*  Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**

* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**  

* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.

2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company. 

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I’ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:  
>  
> 1. Google is fueled by customer’s need for answered information.  
>  
>2. Online video games are fueled by a customer’s need for adventure.  
>  
>3. Reddit is fueled by a customer’s need for community.  
>  
> 4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer’s need for ideas.  
>  
>5. Facebook is fueled by a customer’s need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it. 

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills. 

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.

2. The ability to deeply engage.

3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games. 

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.  


[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.

2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.

3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

&#x200B;

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)

2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)

3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.  

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.  

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

> “Why do I need to learn this?”

It turns out, the answer is not 

>“so you can become a scientist!” 

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>“I need to learn this, so that I can create that.”

&#x200B;

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.  

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.

2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.

3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989. 

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

&#x200B;

[1989](https://preview.redd.it/s0pl9rby5qt61.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aba26a92988fee33e889e1bc394a3a226216978)

&#x200B;

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).

2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input). 

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.

2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.

3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)

4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.

2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.

3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer’s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user’s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we’re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we’ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there’s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.

>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.  


A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

msfygy,,wallstreetbets,post,1618618171,"I counted all the GME Yolos Part 3Hi Everyone,

In case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/)

To summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares.

**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.7 million**.

As I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter  and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimates of  silent whales :

1:9= 4,257 Silent WSB Kongs with 5,187,897 shares.

1:90= 42,570 Silent WSB Kongs with 51,878,970 shares.

Either way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding.

**TDLR: Just 473 WSB Kongs hold 576,433 shares worth 92.7M**",

Did you see the tons of different non-GME YOLOs / DDs that got posted in the last week? Some of those people are probably going to go bankrupt and it would be fun to laugh at them. 

That's kind of cool stuff we want to see more of on WSB. We are WallStreetBETS after all! 

To be honest with you, it's a bit weird seeing people post share YOLOs non-stop. This sub was built on insane options plays (""FDs"") and high risk plays.

If you want to talk GME here, that's cool too, but there's now dedicated subreddits for that, like r/SuperStonk and r/GME. Check them out! You'll find more focused conversation there.

Please comment and UPVOTE if you like what you see and I'll post more depending on what you all want to see this summer!! I finally got enough karma to post on WSB so let's GO!!! 

[US Weekly Box Office Grosses \($\) - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/tu8r6jo3rst61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0fced0cbc3ace032915b3d860fe811bead118f)

I know you Apes have been waiting to hit the big screen! Well Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" has infused new life into the jungle and a struggling US box office in 2020, prompting an upward revision in 2Q estimates across Wall Street. Yet it's too soon to draw conclusions. Film delays and ""day-and-date,"" or studios streaming movies on the same day as their theatrical release, are risks. 

***1)  ""Godzilla vs Kong"" to Top Box Office Again***

It's is expected to top box-office charts for a third consecutive weekend with an estimated $8.7 million, bringing gross receipts to $82.6 million, according to Box Office Pro. California's ArcLight shut down last week, Regal's staggered reopening will continue, so the lack of new films this week should pull total receipts 25-30% lower, based on Box Office Pro estimates. ArcLight and Regal should give AMC an edge going into final spring months and even the early months of the summer when Box Office blockbusters usually get released. 

[US Box Office Projections for April 16 - Source: Bloomberg 4\/17\/21](https://preview.redd.it/bf44qo0oust61.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c44c55b0aa8766766dca657d4030366f74594ae4)

***2) US Vaccine Available To All in 2Q; Theatres Also Gets Shot in Arm With Reopenings***

With cinemas only gradually reopening, 1Q21's box office totaled just under $240 million, an 87% plunge from the $1.83 billion in 1Q20. While that's not totally surprising, 2Q results will be much better, given the success of ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" even with only 55% of cinemas open. As Regal & AMC reopens more of its theaters in April, 2Q box office may hit $650 million, based on Box Office pro's projections, despite Disney's decision to release highly anticipated summer movies ""Cruella"" and ""Black Widow"" on its Disney+ service at the same time as they're available in theaters. Warner's ""Mortal Kombat"" will be out on April 16.

***3)  'Godzilla vs. Kong' Monstrous Open Roars Box Office Back to Life Around the World***

Following a strong international open, Warner Bros. ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" U.S. release had high expectations leading into the long Easter weekend. Those receipts, coming in slightly above the $13.5 million [the studio initially reported](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/box-office-godzilla-vs-kong-nobody-1234948900/) on Sunday, propel the film’s overall tally to $70 million. After two weeks of release, “[Godzilla vs. Kong](https://variety.com/t/godzilla-vs-kong/)” already ranks as the highest-grossing movie of the pandemic era, surpassing Christoper Nolan’s puzzling sci-fi thriller “Tenet,” which ended its theatrical run with $58.4 million.  (Source: Variety Magazine / Variety.com).  This as a step in the right direction leading into the summer blockbuster period as hybrid day-and-date release strategies aren't deterring fans from the theatrical experience. As more vaccines are distributed and theater capacity restrictions are relaxed, expect continued higher box-office receipts.

***4)  AMC Re-Opens California Cinema To Kick-Off Summer Early***

In a small step toward recovery in the global film industry, AMC, the largest theater operator in the world, announced the reopening of 54 of its California locations in March. Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” is projected to take the weekend’s top spot, while Roadside Attraction’s “The Courier” are other notable new films releasing this weekend.

Furthermore, WSB took important place in my life recently, so I decided to give back to the community, creating this comprehensive memeful ape-friendly GME DD 💎🙌🚀🌕🪐🌌In the process of researching GME I was able to accumulate the material into this ape-friendly long read, largely aimed at newcomers of the sub. Though, this giant brain candy can and should be enjoyed by anybody!  
I have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.

My fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble - and I am in the right place for that).

And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles (hopefully).

**LR; TD (Long Read; To Do) by Master Yoda:**

https://preview.redd.it/nz4ujbu2ujt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e45b0bcd43bd5b0247f413b1978e7e246801c41

The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!

# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly

The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: ""A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return."" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.

&#x200B;

**""ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?""**

You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.

**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)

However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,

, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there’s no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a 🌈🐻, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: ""STONKS ONLY GO UP"".

**""k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?""**

Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:

https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2

I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:

**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? 🐻 with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.

**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!

&#x200B;

**""My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?""**

Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!

[\\""Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\"" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)

&#x200B;

**""oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!""** \- an ape.

That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \[big part of the revenue\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:

[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)

As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.

As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?

They dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...

https://preview.redd.it/8l0ujmtsvjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2deb71b74665b5d5395a97249941d74570a9b1

And soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...

&#x200B;

**""WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?""**

Everything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!

By buying a big stake of GME \[12.91% currently\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.

[Many, but not u\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)

It is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‘traders’ and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:

https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a

When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  🌈🐻 HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.

&#x200B;

**""Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?""**

Dafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  


# shortz r fuk

&#x200B;

**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.

Apemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.

Oh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. 🐻 with me, this is the most interesting part.

https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7

Remember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.

For now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but

https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae

Furthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. Сounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.

Furthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?

More than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?

**TL; DR:**

I've seen some tendies get thrown around the CRISPR space lately with all the $EDIT talk which is great to see as I feel I can finally contribute something meaningful to r/WSB.  I assume you apes have had a little exposure to the Cell & Gene Therapy (C&GT) industry when you're jerkin off on the couch to Cathie Woods and her $ARKG fund while your wife and her boyfriend are in the master bedroom, but then again probably not.  So, please read the preamble before throwing your shit all over my DD.

**Key Points on Cell and Gene Therapy Industry**

C&GT is a long time in the making and many (including several Nobel prize winning) discoveries had to coalesce but the industry is finally starting to hit major inflection points. One of the major subcategories within C&GT are ""cell-based gene therapies"" like CAR-T cell therapy. A patient's (or donor's) T cell is genetically engineered to express a CAR which drives the T cell towards the cancer cells. There are 5 FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies on the market. Below is a table from Wikipedia with more info on them.

https://preview.redd.it/wk1h7t06sqt61.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=798b37452937b4018f93f1939d5794ca80d2fc1a

There are many other subcategories within C&GT and many other types of ""cell-based gene therapies"" beyond CAR-T cell therapy.  Not all of these require genetic engineering, FYI.

On January 15, 2019 commissioners from the [FDA issued a bullish statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-peter-marks-md-phd-director-center-biologics) on the C&GT industry and here are some highlights:

1. ""The FDA is witnessing a surge of cell and gene therapy products entering early development, evidenced by a large upswing in the number of investigational new drug (IND) applications.""
2. ""We anticipate that by 2020 we will be receiving more than 200 INDs per year, building upon our total of more than 800 active cell-based or directly administered gene therapy INDs currently on file with the FDA.""
3. ""And by 2025, we predict that the FDA will be approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy products a year based on an assessment of the current pipeline and the clinical success rates of these products.

&#x200B;

When you look at the [FDA's IND Receipts for Biologics](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/ind-activity/ind-receipts) in 2018, we see that 1594 INDs were filed. This was a below average year compared to the 1614 (+/-70) INDs that were filed, on average, from 2014 through 2019. It is important to remember that there was a ""surge"" of C&GT products entering the early development landscape BEFORE the pandemic because this implies that the share of C&GT IND receipts is growing in a pie of \~1600 new INDs per year. In 2020, the FDA received 2182 INDs.

The ""surge"" in C&GT products entering early development the FDA noted in their early 2019 statement was a mere prelude to the 2020 surge in C&GT therapy products entering early development as evidenced by large upswings in the number of new INDs.

Unfortunately, there are many risks involved with investing in early, mid, or late stage biologic drug developers because of their high cash burn rate and constant threat of dilution. Obviously the tendies can be nice if some of these companies get acquired but that's a tough game to play. IMO, you are much better off finding a company that provides the C&GT industry with all the reagents, consumables, and instruments that these developers and institutions use to conduct R&D and development work. **Enter, $TECH**.

[Bio-techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) is a NE Minneapolis, MN based company that has largely grown through acquisitions. It's largest subsidiary is R&D Systems, a company that has been providing research grade reagents to the biotech industry for 50 years. That brand is well known and have a great reputation. They have quietly acquired many other brands quite strategically which will enable them to service the growing C&GT industry new ways like: GMP reagents for use in the expanding clinical and commercial landscape, gene editing technology (including CRISPR/Cas9 and other non-viral methods), contract development and manufacturing services, analytical instrumentation and assays, etc. [See here for full list of Bio-techne brands.](https://www.bio-techne.com/about/bio-techne-brands) 

 

**The Metaphorical Stars Align**

Not only is $TECH a fundamentally sound company with strong analyst reviews (see my E\*Trade snapshot below), but stars are soon to be aligning that you apes need to be aware of.

**On 4/20, $TECH will break through its $420 resistance**. I mean come on, this is too good to be true right? See my shitty technical analysis below for confirmation bias. Everything seems to be lining up.

Here are my holdings of $TECH.

 **TL;DR:** If you like $EDIT, $ARKG, or any other hot cell and gene therapy companies like $CRSP, $FATE, etc. but do not want to invest in cell and gene therapy developers directly (because of risk), then $TECH is for you. Not only has $TECH supported the biotech field with reagents, assays, and instrumentation for 40 years, they will continue to take market share in the rapidly growing clinical/commercial (non-R&D) groups. Finally, their stonk will break through the $420 resistance on 4/20.",['BIO']

>apes and autists,

Retards and autists pls.

Also, most biotech/pharma stocks see massive movements on approval/breakthrough days. So, unless there is any potential catalyst, it's not likely that it will despite whatever your shitty 2012 4/20 memes indicate.

Also, your TA is way off. Price action shows that a reversal back down is more likely than a breakthrough.",

msy9s3,,wallstreetbets,post,1618690782,"Explanation of the $CLOV 10k and Calculating Short Interest by handEdit: I seem to be getting downvoted a lot, yet not a single person has replied criticizing my math and the numbers....

TL;DR: The real short interest is 35.1% and the data provider which first reported 140% has changed it back to this number. Also, I apologize in advance for disrupting the echo chamber.

Over the last two days many people all over every social media platform have been in debate as to what $CLOV's real float count is and what the real short interest as a % of the Float is. I am here to explain what went wrong in FactSet's calculations (which have now been fixed BTW: [source](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)) and to calculate the float by hand using information and data provided in $CLOV's 10k to confirm the validity. Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.

Here are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:

* There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)
* There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.

What is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:

Yesterday FactSet reported that float was \~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.

&#x200B;

Now for the 10k:

&#x200B;

[10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)

This 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.

Further, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.

Therefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**

Taking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:

(38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**

Now to clear up some more misconceptions:

[Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.

*Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*

It is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:

1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding.
2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III.

Also why are people all of a sudden so keen on listening to S3 Partners? Did people all of a sudden forget who owns them? (Its Citadel).",['MMM']
msy9s3,guwinew,wallstreetbets,comment,1618694736,I think the question is: how much is leftover after you take out insiders and long hold institutions like vanguard.

[LOSS PRON](https://u.teknik.io/fkVQx.jpg)

The music for todays post is a tryptic. Play in this order.

**Hat in the Wind** \- **Themselves**

**Light Work - Prof**

**All that Glitters - Dead Elvis**

I spent today at work in a sort of elevated and removed state.  The feeling of wanting to puke in every trashcan you walk by mixed with the just-above-ground-floating-weightlessness of an empty portfolio. It was something akin to a cactus whose skin people drink in a jungle I was once in.  Truly my spirit is no longer burdened by excessive wealth. Was it even mine though.. Zen masters believe you reincarnate through every door you walk through, Someone real sensitive said ""May we always just begin to see our selves as something else and smile""

**Some of you, well let me correct myself, many of you will know this feeling.**  The brief apparition of gold that appears in the middle of a trade which does not deter you from continuing some sort of mad ascension, pressing the gas pedal to the floor as you rocket into Valhalla as fast as you smash out. I want to be with you and join your YOLO'd ranks. I know these 5 digits are nothing compared to the magnanimous losses that sit on red thrones much larger than mine but its all relative right.  Life is too short to be a bitch and chicks dig scars.

**The specific details are a blur.**  GOEV is a fast bitch.  She's got a lot to offer just not now.  What tony has in his hat will take probably months to percolate... Shorts are in control and will be now that retail has been absolutely beaten up.  They will probably bail in some shape or form one of the first chances they get.  **There will always be a core group of supporters which I am one of. I really believe in the tech.  I believe that they have the power to disrupt transportation like the Model T did.**

News will be released soon and I would say that its going to be on a scale of -10 which is Lawsuits have traction to 10 which is Apple Car.  Factory and manufacturing partner with some pre-orders is probably a 5-7 depending... You're going to need an 8+ to kick off a naughty squeeze... Or someone will have to take on the unified shorts in the sector. The big move will be convincing institutions to buy in and catch the paper hands of the bailing retail.  Canoo must have a better ground game.  This will either be Cloughvis (God damnit I cant even use your ticker you absolute piece of shit stock because your market cap is too weak for WSB)or CLOV, Canoo gets to pick.  (Watch news drop tomorrow lulz).  Most good stock value plays are pain trains until they are not.

**Personally I need to learn to take gains**, be a bit less believing in my own confirmation bias bullshit.  I need to add a few months if not more to most options plays.  I also need to dark side a bit more and also run spreads. I also have to realize. Shorts are fucking violent and can bring pain.  They don't give up easy and fight on multiple fronts.

**Anyways I would like to thank all of you who joined me on this descent** into a sort of infatuated madness that could only be described as the autistic form of dementia that Lewis Carrol suffered from.  The following is a list of names and by no means is exhaustive but its the ones I can find right now.  I will continue to add as I re-read all the kind messages people have sent.  It has been a strange and crazy trip friends.

I do want to leave this, let me dismount my one trick pony and talk about the past and the future.

**I've spent a lot of time in the past getting into fist fights with death** (and only sometimes winning) and I realized that money doesn't mean a lot.  There's a certain level of financial stability which gets you to a point where you have everything on auto-pay and that works as long as you don't piss off your boss or still like your job. But its really just another stress in life. Enough money will buy you a seat next to the window at the SNF or all the experiences in life you can want.  But that yellow stretcher doesn't give a fuck where it finds you...  It will be there for you one day just the same. Please don't fucking waste your time its all you have. My **Hurt Circus** people will know what I'm talking about all lights, sirens boots on and beard on fire.

But fuck it, I want to be rich.

**The future,** at least as it pertains to this particular writing project of mine will be a rags to riches project.  We'll see if I have what it takes.  I'm open to suggestions of tickers or if you want me to write on something particular send it over and I'll give it a look. I encourage you to upload your own GOEV loss porn in the comments. But also if you won. Maybe show that off to...

But in the meantime I'll see you there.

Be well.

msh8uj,,wallstreetbets,post,1618622890,"why you should be rock hard for $DIS, from a nerdAlrighty retards, I've been here since late January and I am amazed at how little chatter there is about Disney right now.  There's 3 key things that make me super bullish about it, and I'm gonna try to break them down without any of that technical jargon that you need to be actually smart to understand. Disney+, Disney Parks, and their merchandise.

So! let's start with the easiest one to dive into:

# THE THEME PARKS: 

 In 2019, Disney parks generated 6.7 BILLIONS in income, a little over 40% of their entire revenue.  With the pandemic, park attendance obviously plummeted, and several closed.  At the time of writing this, only 3 of the 6 parks globally are open, with one (Disney California) set to re open by the end of the month with reduced capacity (around 25% of the max).  With Biden's plan to have everyone able to be vaccinated soon, that capacity is going to back up to max, and as the entire world recovers the other parks go back to normal too.  with every park going back up, there's gonna be a massive bump in income.  That's before you consider that most everyone has been locked up for over a year now, and I am willing to bet my left nut that somewhere some little timmy and billy have been begging their middle class mommy and daddy to go to Disney.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see record attendance numbers for these parks this year.   


But wait, there's more! There is an Avengers themed area set to open in June this year, and Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars themed section of the American Parks, opened May 31, 2019  to  rave reviews!  Given the new Star Wars content being announced and published, attractions like these are going to continue to expand and draw people with new experiences.  You can build your own lightsaber there, for $200! and that ties into...  


# THE MERCHANDISE:

Disney sells a LOT of shit.  I mean, a fucking lot.  Star Wars alone has entire series of novels, comic books, video games, apparel, and even a convention (Star Wars Celebration) .  And since the Sequel trilogy has ended, Disney has moved Star Wars into a new era: The High Republic.  Primarily as books and comics, this era is 200 years before the mainline series.  They have CENTURIES of timeline to play with, and without the restraints of existing material to confine them.  The Clone Wars is only a roughly 3 year period in the lore, and the amount of shit that happens in that period is insane.  Disney is going to milk this period for as much as they can, with some speculation they may bring in some fan favorite characters from Star Wars Legends (canon before Disney bought the rights and erased 90% of the timeline), namely Darth Revan.  I won't get into it too much, but Revan alone is a huge draw for Star Wars Fanatics.  Marvel is also killing it with comic books and collectibles, but my knowledge is admittedly less in depth on the MCU stuff, merch wise.  The universe, though?

&#x200B;

# DISNEY+:

Disney+ is an absolute gold mine that Disney is sitting on.  They have exclusive access to two of the biggest IP's, period, with Star Wars and the MCU, and both are built on movies and tv shows.  With how the Netflix MCU shows have had the rights revoked, the onslaught of new shows (Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Clone Wars season 7, Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, Kenobi...) Disney is setting itself up to keep those subscriber numbers up by slow feeding the horde of fans with content.  Add in how they've been doing movie releases on the platform with Mulan, where you paid an additional $30 to access the brand new movie, and how that model has also been confirmed for the upcoming Black Widow and Cruella films, and it's a safe assumption that Disney is gearing the platform up to be a theatre alternative.  why go buy a movie ticket and drive to theater, deal with a noisy crowd, and not be able to pause the movie when you can just buy it from home and watch it? This is likely going to happen for the entire future of the MCU.  The big ace up the sleeve though, is the Fox library.  Remember that Disney bought out Fox not too long ago? They have nearly all Fox content now on Disney+.  X-men, Avatar (blue aliens, not the cartoon) Night at the Museum, etc are all Disney now.   


In short, Disney is STACKED to make a killing these next few years, but especially this year.","['IP', 'NFLX', 'DIS', 'FOX']"

Only 145 million shares are outstanding.
The other shares are locked.
The float is something between 110 million (yahoo) and 144 million (bloomberg).
What happened?
To calculate the short interest they reduced the float by the 83 million owned by the CEO.
This leads to a new float of 26 million.
This is the float the media is referencing.
Only the CEO shares are already included in the 255 million shares, that are locked.
The real float still is between 110 and 144 million.
So with 39 million shares shortet, the short interest is really between 27 and 36 %.

The volume today was 244 million and the short volume 89 million (fintel)
This would also be very hard to reach with a float of 26 million.

I think this is huge. People bought because of this data or closed their short positions.

# What do they do?  Well, the TL:DR is they help ensure that you have to wait longer before you can collect the inheritance and life insurance on your Boomer ass parents, because it helps keep them alive.

&#x200B;

They're really more of a product than a company. (yeah, I know about the EndoWrist shit, but that's hardly a revenue generator)  They make the Da  Vinci robot surgeon that you see in hospitals so long as you live in a nicer, more gentrified part of town.  Or work for one of the Colombian drug cartels - those dudes have the best medics.  If you've never heard of it, it's basically a Swiss army knife of attachments that will cut your ass open, fix what it can (sorry, that extra chromosome has to stay), and stitch you back up, all while your surgeon deals with his raging hangover and wonders what happened after he blacked out to where his ass is really sore this morning and the security guard out in the parking lot can't stop smiling at him.  That's it.  That's all they do.  Blah blah blah proprietary software blah blah blah expensive maintenance contracts blah blah blah each attachment for the robot costs money so hopefully your hospital sprang for the clip applier attachment before they snipped that pulmonary vein.  Fingers crossed.

Also, it apparently makes pancakes. :

[Cause that's not creepy at all](https://preview.redd.it/kssh7h1mnht61.jpg?width=993&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c30426e1dd5fba779b9efdc7c524868f364120f2)

&#x200B;

Which goes to show how outdated the tech has become, since everybody knows ebelskivers are superior.

# Deep dive:  This won't hurt a bit, except for the parts where it's excruciatingly bad.

&#x200B;

$ISRG is a 95 billion dollar company that sells about 1200 ~~Treadwell Droids~~  surgical robots a year at 2 million dollars a pop, and has come up with a great scam where some of the attachments are disposable so you have to keep buying them.  God bless America.  They make about a billion a year licensing out their software for use to mitigate the fact that your doctor can't remember which cord goes into which hole, and another 700 million or so on maintenance contracts to reboot the things when they accidentally kill somebody.   They make about 4 billion dollars annually, give or take.  For a company that lives and dies by its R&D, it surprisingly has no debt on the books.  It just makes more shares when they need money.   This also might have something to do with the fact that they haven't really improved on the thing in 20 years because nobody is forcing them to innovate.   They're trading near their ATH, at 804.72 as of the time of this writing.   The biggest fundamental thing to note about this company is that they basically have no competitors.  There is a company out there called (name redacted because of automoddy)  that made a run at the king, but fell so short that they changed their name from (name redacted because of automoddy) Surgical.  It's not that their robot - the Senhance - was bad, per se, it was just that it turned out it was only good for laparoscopics, which is fairly niche.  For the record, I like that company, but we can't talk about them here.

&#x200B;

One thing I've always hated about this company but have held my nose and overlooked was that it's PB ratio is way out of whack for its space.  The average company in the medical equipment industry averages about 5.1 PB.  $ISRG sits at 9.7.  Their PEG also sits at 6.5, which is fucking crazy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Cool.  So how much growth for buying in to the fucking robot army?

&#x200B;

Actually....none.  They made 2.64 a share a year ago, but the whispers on the street - and by street, I mean company executives - are to expect a down quarter this time around due to a combination of less hospital revenue as a result of leaving so much open bed space for the spicy flu and lower demand for elective surgical procedures - and, of course, by lower demand, I mean people being told they can't have them because there's a risk of catching a bug that you'll probably never even know you caught.  $ISRG had been rising recently on the ASSUMPTION that hospitals were going to open back up to more high margin things like elective procedures and away from things like ""leaving half the hospital empty in case 3 people catch the 'Rona"".  However, through the 1st quarter of the year, that has not happened, which means the backlog of surgical procedures just continues to grow.  Ambulatory surgery centers throughout a good chunk of the country still haven't converted away from triage facilities yet or are closing down surgical theatres periodically to reallocate staff, and there's no real word on when that is going to get rectified.

&#x200B;

Analysts have already been adjusting their expectations for the quarter downwards in the last month.  Expectations are now a 4% drop in earnings on flat-to-slightly-up overall revenues.  $ISRG has a habit of beating on earnings pretty much always, but they've reached such a lofty valuation that swapping out Tyson Fury for a Tyson chicken and then bragging you kicked its ass probably isn't going to be that impressive.

&#x200B;

# Wait...so why should I buy it?

Plot twist:  This is a SHORT DD.  My first one since the prophetic $PLTR DD that got -700'd on February 5th before I finally deleted it and let those retards lose their asses **(I'm never going to stop saying I told you so, bitches**).  Bet that was harder to see coming than knowing Will Smith was going to become best friends with a toaster an hour before it happened, eh?

Actually, that's not entirely true.  This is a hybrid.

&#x200B;

The thing to note is that it's tested prices in the $81x's 3 times now (let's call it 810, because that's really where liquidity always starts to dry up), and has been rejected all three times.  And it's sitting pretty damn close to that again.  Also, every time it's tested resistance and failed, it's dropped to at least the mid 700's, usually crossing into the 6's briefly, which presently serves as strong support.  It's presently trading near its ATH's not because of anything it's done, but rather because lately the trend has been to rotate into big growth companies again, forgetting that small and mid cap plays exist.  That's all well and good, but one off quarter and you're no longer contributing to the artificial inflation of the $SPY.  This has been a  reliable quiet swing trader for me, but it's now at a crucial pivot point that's going to require a strong catalyst to continue any upwards momentum.  That's bad news for a company reporting earnings in a time when even Wall Street darlings sell off even on great quarters.  At the very least, this is a rally that is quickly running out of gas, as evidenced by reduced volume.  With them reporting next week on the 20th, the pivot point of reckoning is upon us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# My logic is undeniable (or, to summarize):

&#x200B;

* For the 2nd time in a row, an S&P 500 company that operates on the fringes of traditional growth
* Has positively ripped during this rotation from value into growth, in spite of all signals showing a down quarter and poor forward guidance as we are still in a period of Covidic uncertainty and what it means for the operating theatre
* Has no known competitors, which has not pushed them to expand into other revenue channels besides crazy expensive machines meant to cover up for how few decent doctors are entering the workforce anymore
* Is trading at a crucial resistance point that has been rejected forcefully 2 times in the past, with reduced volume each time
* IV on calls is quite pricey, but puts are dirt cheap
* If you really want dad's house, maybe make sure the ambulance sends him to Watts instead of Malibu.  Remember, if he ends up surviving the procedure, he's going to rat you out to the cops

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'm expecting a miss when they report earnings next week, or at the very least a very muted guidance.  As such, I would not be surprised to see this stonk slip all the way down into the 720-740 range before it regains some footing.  Barring some sort of catalyst, I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going to get over that 820 hump any time in the near future.

&#x200B;

# How to play it.  That, detective, is the right question:

&#x200B;

All the technical signs and oscillators are pointing to it becoming a very top heavy trade, which means it's primed for a much bigger negative breakout on the slightest weakness.    All that said, I certainly wouldn't go bear on it long-term.  $ISRG has never been one of the most violent movers, but it has a way of defying the odds, and has displayed that ability in the face of adversity for decades now.  I think if they miss next week and the stock goes into a freefall, be prepared to be nimble and cash out the put and switch back to long, even if it's not necessarily justified.

&#x200B;

# An edit:

If you don't like the short action because of liquidity (a very valid item if you're interested in more than a handful of contracts), skip that part of it and set an alarm to go long at 725-ish.  You'll be happy with that one, too.

&#x200B;

# Position Disclaimers:

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure I own more than a few shares of this in my managed asset portfolios and, even though my short-term outlook is bearish, am also fairly certain my fund managers aren't going to want to create a taxable event with them.  **I am just flat-out short on the stock itself, but my appetite for potentially unlimited risk is different, and I can't say anybody else should do that.**  I'm holding 4/30 780 puts that I picked up for 10-ish bucks, as well as 5/28 $800p's.  I recently sold off my 7/16 795c's for a tidy profit.   Were I less of a pussy, I'd probably buy some 4/23 780p FD's.  Actually, I might do that for fun, anyways.  But remember, I'm gambling on a selloff on weakness.  If those further out puts print, I will cover them within a week or earnings and look for a consolidation pattern (probably a week or two later) to reverse course and buy some calls for another swing up.

&#x200B;

**Word of caution:**  Buying puts on a mega tech in this environment is an inherently risky move because big money has been rotating into it for weeks now.    This is not a bet-the-house scenario.  I have about a 70% conviction this is gonna go my way, but that other 30% is pretty ugly and basically guarantees a complete loss.  And even if you do play this along with me and it prints, don't sit there and try to milk it for too long.  Some hedge fund could decide it's oversold at 735 and eat away at your tendies.  Fuck that guy.  And then go buy one of these, because fucking him is legally perilous and he might fight back - the robot will never say no.

ms51jy,guqv9vm,wallstreetbets,comment,1618593439,"Thank you for sharing. As a robot surgeon myself, maybe I can give back some love by giving my opinion on the matter.

First of all, it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you 've certainly done a good job about that, which gives you more credibility IMO. Maybe not the hangover part but still.

Speaking long term, this company is here to stay. The technology they offer is second to none.  The ease of operating, what we can achieve, it really is world changing. Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot-assisted and not laparoscopically anymore.

They have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable, big maintenance contracts, and a new model every few years (so they did improve, actually, and continue to do so); support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one.

They have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar. Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent  it, mostly because robotics are quite expensive. They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on, but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills. However, sorry to offend, but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical.

The only reason why not everyone is using the robot already, is exactly this, that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position, and so it really is expensive to use it.

I believe that at some point in the future, another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards. IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R&D and not be swallowed by Intuitive. For me, Medtronic is the best bet for this (or maybe some Chinese company). This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery (and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive); on the other hand, it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top, they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field, and continue to grow from this in the long term.

It is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery (it has a lot of oncological applications, but even some of those got postponed), also put a hold on congresses, training programs etc. and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now, but probably only momentarily. I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price, but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead (which in retrospect, I should have done already a long time ago). In the meantime, I am long Medtronic as well. Not very wallstreetbetsy, but I believe these are both good plays long term.",

msu5p0,,wallstreetbets,post,1618677771,"Low effort COHU DDCohu makes backend testing equipment for semiconductors. Cohu is the global leader in handlers with a share of 55% of the market. Their testing business continues to take market share from larger competitors, qorvo and skyworks. 

How does the business work? Cohu makes capital equipment for testing semi’s. They have two businesses, selling capital equipment to other firms, and offering testing to companies that want to outsource that process. 

We all know that there is a global semiconductor shortage, which is a strong catalyst. But the real catalyst is increasing volume. The number of semiconductors per phone is increasing. With 5g devices, there are nearly twice as many chips per phone as compared to 4g. This means twice as much testing. Additionally, with the move to electric vehicles, the automotive testing segment is growing rapidly. Cars that used to have only a few chips, are now crammed full of them. This trend of increasing chip volume is true for PC’s, phones, electric vehicles, self driving vehicles, IOT, cloud computing, and ai development. All of these growing industries have one thing in common, the need for lots of semiconductors to continue driving innovation. 

Financially cohu is a very attractive stock, even having nearly tripled in the past year. With a nice 42% profit margin and growing revenues, the company is still fairly priced. Ttm gross profit is 271 million, compared to their market cap of 2.3 billion. This is a market cap/profit ratio of 8.48.

mryu3o,,wallstreetbets,post,1618561474,"AMC are playing both the short and the long term game and praise the retal investors.Duh, not a financial advisor.

I loved every word of the interview with Adam Aron. He seems to be watching the market volume closely and plan his actions accordingly.

Quote from the article:

*""the movie-theater chain is once again “under attack” from short sellers after skirting bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic.*  *The volume of short sales — bets that the stock will go down — rose about 50% in March to 73.8 million shares* *""*

Now, I'm not a market guru but I still believe that AMC are severely undervalued and heavily shorted. Yes, they've accumulated some debt but so have others and they survived through the worst of the pandemic one way or another, which means that the only way to go is UP.

If anything, they are on route to become winners after the pandemic since the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific theatres have announced plans to close permanently.

*""Other theaters have succumbed to the Covid-19-struggle. ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres, two jointly owned California movie-theater chains, announced plans this week to close permanently, underscoring the still-tenuous state of the industry.""* 

The heavily discussed topic about the announcement to vote for the right to sell 500 million shares, which lead to significant price drop and short selling activity, has also been discussed by Adam Aron. The response:

*""If investors at the May 4 annual meeting approve the plan for additional stock, he’ll gain flexibility to buy back debt at a discount or acquire another chain at an attractive price, which would counteract any dilution.""*

And more importantly:

*""Aron, who has long been known as outspoken, also praised the internet investors who see themselves as fighting against “conventional” market participants, like short sellers who profit when stock prices decline. He connected with Collins, who offers online investment commentary under the username Trey’s Trades, after his 30-year-old son saw a tweet that Collins had sent to his nearly 50,000 followers, known as “apes.”*

*“My hat’s off to you,” Aron said. “I’m well aware that you have been talking about AMC a lot over the last few months and you have, you know, hundreds of thousands of subscribers, tens and tens of thousands of people watching your shows on the YouTube channel,” Aron said.*

*“I actually work for you,” he said, “and for that reason it’s a special reason for me to engage with all of you.”*

Read the last paragraph again. He works for us. So is every CEO on this goddamn planet that you guys have stocks in and hold long term. But he is the one who publicly acknowledged it. 

In summary:

1. Adam Aron acknowledged the rising activity in short selling which influences the price. 
2. He acknowledges the debt so he is acting accordingly.
3. Competition (at least on the west coast) reduced.
4. He works for the ""apes"".
5. No plans to immediately sell the 500 million shares they announced. If things get tough, they have the right to sell 43 million shares to cover debt which means bankruptcy is NOT on the cards.

It was a tough year for the theatre giant but CEO Adam Aron believes in a bright future. It was a one in a generation economic and health crisis but AMC survived. The only way to go is UP.

I posted this in the PLTR sub in response to a lot of threads I saw about insider selling and complaints about stock compensation models in tech companies. Figured I'd also post it here for anyone interested in my take (as a tech worker) on these things.

Okay the title is somewhat misleading because I don't necessarily **love** insider selling, but I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere especially on insider selling and I've found there's a misconception of stock-based compensation and selling by insiders. To preface, I am a software engineer for a large cap tech company and this is my take on stock-based compensation in the tech world and some basic things that I think all people should be aware of when it comes to this compensation and the insider selling that accompanies it.

To start I'll give a little background on the way stock compensation works for people on the ground. The grunts like me who do the normal day-to-day boring coding that enables the apps and products you use. I'll be using mostly the FAANG companies as examples of established public companies and the kind of compensation you see there.

&#x200B;

**First things first: how does stock compensation work for most of these people?**

At most of these companies stock compensation is typically most heavy in the technical organizations of the company. That is to say, engineers are being compensated primarily in equity in the company in raw dollar terms, in some cases well over 50% of their yearly income. ***This difference is usually most prevalent in the first four years of employment.***

Why is that last sentence true? Because your initial grant of equity is typically one of the largest in order to ""get you in the door."" The cliff, as tech workers call it, at four years is the time at which an engineer will typically experience a net decrease in their overall income due to the fact that one of the largest grants they received expires at this time and their refresher grants are not as sizeable in dollar terms (excepting the most outstanding performers and the most rapid promotions, but these are very rare).

As a matter of fact, it's a well-known and oft-used strategy to bail from a company after your four year cliff and move to another or SIMPLY REAPPLY TO THE SAME COMPANY FOR ANOTHER INITIAL GRANT. Yes, this happens. I know people personally who have done it. You could call it mercenary behavior.

Personally, my total compensation every year is comprised of approximately 51% equity, 6.5% bonus, and the remaining 42.5% in salary (accounting for the current share price). And here's the important note about that: ***I am not by any means a stellar performer at the company***. I am at a senior level and meeting expectations well for my job and role but I am not in the upper bands of the most highly compensated individuals as a result of either stellar or lucky performance. I am well past my 4 year cliff though it doesn't matter, because I didn't begin my career as an engineer, which actually cost me a lot of money transferring to engineering. Remember those initial grants engineers get? Transfers don't get those. Point being: I am a decent engineer doing good work and my compensation is still driven mostly by equity. If I were getting much higher ratings, the percentage of my compensation driven by equity would be substantially larger.

Everything you've just read is pretty industry standard for these large caps as mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**

Isn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.

Remember above how I said that the yearly equity I receive is currently 51% of my total compensation. That's because the share price is where it is. If tomorrow the share price drops by 50%... well that would be bad. You know what would make it worse? The fact that the other load of stock I have in the company isn't vested and just dropped SIGNIFICANTLY in value and depending on what triggered the drop could be heading towards zero.

That's because the company doesn't hire you and just hand you a fat stack of stock. You vest a portion of it over time, regularly. Industry standard for many of these companies is now that you vest a grant over 4 years at 1/16th each quarter. So for me, right around earnings season I get 1/16th of each grant I've received for the previous 4 years. The point of this is clearly to keep me invested and to keep me driving for my own success by advocating for and working on the best things for the business.

&#x200B;

**What kind of stock grants are there?**

There are lots. But I'll quickly go over the one that people like Alex Karp deal with (joining a company well before going public) and the one I'm most familiar with: RSUs.

With RSUs, it's a pretty simple thing: the company will give you stock every quarter!

Okay so it's not quite this simple but close, and most importantly this is a taxable event - I'll talk about this next. The company hands you a cash bonus (basically) to buy the stock at the current market price and then you exercise that to buy the stock. Awesome! Except... you just got more income... and you have now locked all that money up in shares of your company. Uncle Sam would like a word with you about this.

With people like Alex Karp the situation is even more interesting: they are given options to the stock in the company. What does that mean? Exactly what you think it does. They are issued long call options with expirations and strikes against the stock. Alex Karp is in this situation now - he has over 60m options expiring that give him the ability to buy Palantir shares at the strike. However, the current price of the shares is well above his strike and the company is giving him compensation in the form of allowing him to buy the shares at their market rate for his strike. Uncle Sam would now like a word with Mr. Karp.

&#x200B;

**So how do these taxes work?**

My company uses a sell to cover model. What does this mean? When I am issued shares my company will simply sell some of those shares after they are purchased in order to send the proceeds to the IRS. What this value represents is the expected value of the tax I would pay on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares at the current market rate. Basically, I would sell 35% of my shares instantly to cover the expected 35% tax I would owe on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares. This is pretty straightforward and for someone like me doesn't even really register as insider selling because it's not large enough in quantity and I'm not C suite or any of that. But this is a form of insider selling that is automatic to cover taxes. Read this if you want: [https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html)

With options it's a bit different because the income to purchase the stock (the bonus) would be the difference between the strike price of the calls given to the employee and the current price of the stock. So Alex Karp's over 60m shares are currently valued at well over a billion dollars. But that means the relative income that the company provided to cover his stock purchase is almost the entire value of the stock (his strikes are really low). Now he has a FUCK ALL MASSIVE TAX BILL on the income he was granted to purchase the stocks.

So when he exercises these options and then you read about him selling a few million shares, remember this - he is obligated to pay a 37% tax on the income granted to him to purchase those shares that he can either pay with his own money, selling a portion of his grant, or offsetting in some other way.

&#x200B;

**These grants given to employees are not just brand new shares**

I've seen a bit of confusion about stock compensation specifically here so I'm going keep it short on this point - this sort of compensation is not just NEW SHARES FOR EVERY NEW GRANT!@!@!!!@@ That's not how it works. Dilution and new share issuance is a thing - but it's not the norm. If you're asking why they keep giving stock to people to work for them and that's why you think the price is dipping on things re-read this portion.

&#x200B;

**Insider selling is predictable**

Why is this? Most of these people are using 10b5 plans to schedule their stock sales. Insiders are locked out of trading their own stock or even related derivatives the vast majority of the time. That includes grunts like me. Most stock sales that I conduct are for reinvestment purposes and taxes (these are automatic). But the common trait is they all happen after earnings because that's when our lockup period expires and we are granted our new shares. That's why you see people like Zuckerberg, Thiel, Pichai, Bezos, etc. selling at the same time all the time or as a result of a scheduled release. Think of a 10b5 as dollar cost averaging but for the sell side.

&#x200B;

**Parting thought**

One of the main reasons I don't freak out when I see insider selling like we've seen here (unless it's dickhead Chamath and his SPACs which I won't touch because fuck that toolbox) is that I see this sort of sell-off all the time and because I understand a bit of the problem space Palantir is in. I actually used to work on the problem that got them to start this company while they were at PayPal: payments fraud. I also know that the industry really, really doesn't know how to handle problems like this as effectively as they think and that there are untapped places where software like this would be invaluable. Even in my own work, I can think of almost a half dozen places where this would be directly relevant to MY role in a large cap. I can only imagine the value if it were company wide.

***Also, you guys know how I look at companies that try to recruit or poach me if they're not public companies?*** When I get messages from these series A and series B folks or stealth startups I almost always go in to look at what their growth potential is. I look at it as though I'm trying to do a value investment. What is their TAM? What will it be next year? What is their current valuation? How has it changed in their funding rounds? What sort of people work there and would I expect to build an amazing company with a ton of deep value with people like that? How do their finances and board structure look to me? Is this going to be attractive to other investors? Is the product they are offering going to be the best? Can I make it that?

What do all those questions boil down to: ***WHERE THE FUCK IS THEIR STOCK GOING?!***

Because here's the thing, most grunts like me who leave our cushy large cap jobs for places like this are doing so knowing full well that we are taking a pay cut. What are we looking for? To create the deep value that is going to drive that stock value way up and offer the best product so that the paper money we are promised to get in the door turns into some real money. What drives us to make it better? Knowing that we have more paper money left on the table that we also want to be worth something. That and most of us leave jobs for paper money for problems we love. Problems we think about at night. Problems that we think will change something drastically.",['PYPL']

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

Average target price $38.21","['AAPL', 'FDX', 'PEP', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'GM', 'GE']"

$TSP shares are still trading around IPO price of $40.

Here is the story of TuSimple founded in San Diego in 2015 that already has partnerships with UPS, Xpress and McLane. Also did a trial run for USPS last year.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-will-haul-mail-for-usps-in-two-week-pilot/

From an article last year:

[https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/)

TuSimple already carries freight in its autonomous trucks (always with human safety operators on board) along seven different routes between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso and Dallas. TuSimple said it will expand its service area with existing customers UPS and McLane. U.S. Xpress is a new partner. Penske will help TuSimple scale its fleet of operations nationwide and provide preventative maintenance for the self-driving trucks, the company said.

TuSimple said the network will be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which will launch in 2020 and into 2021, will cover service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

This fall, TuSimple plans to open a new shipping terminal in Dallas. TuSimple said these terminals are designed to be shared by mid-sized customers. TuSimple will carry freight directly to a company’s distribution center if it is a high-volume customer.

The second phase will begin in 2022 and expand service from Los Angeles to Jacksonville and connect the East Coast with the West, the company said.

The final phase will expand across the lower 48 states, beginning in 2023. The company said it will replicate the strategy in Europe and Asia after the AFN rolls out nationwide.

Seems like a good follow through until Oct

TuSimple, has amassed a workforce of about 800 and raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors. The company posted revenue of $1.8 million last year and a net loss of $177.9 million, according to the filing, reflecting how it is still in the early stages of developing commercial technology.

TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren’t equivalent to sales revenue.

When you bet on a comp this early, you need to look at the space and team.

Autonomous trucking space is red hot. Trucking by far happens on the interstate highways which are easiest to automate for Level 4 and 5.

Trucking by far is very lucrative to automate. Cost of goods carried. No long stops, more safety, machines are less susceptible to fatigue. The merits of automating trucking need another reddit post all by itself. 

Now let's look at the team:

Well, it does have a connection to ‘China’ but the founder seems legit.

ms76oi,,wallstreetbets,post,1618591449,"MSOS YOLO and DD - Why I'm betting on next week to change the game for cannabis in the United States# Trying to be the Prophet of Profit

There's been a great deal of talk, trading and speculation about the cannabis sector in the past few years. Over the past few years and more interestingly few months we're seeing a staggering increase in legalization of recreational cannabis in the united states at the state level.

More importantly keeping a close eye on the activity of the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer there is a continuous promise of reform legislation being introduced ""soon"". Soon is a dangerous word and this is an invitation to time the market.

Normally don't ever try to time the market like this. I'm a big believer in leaps on principle. From a few key data points being vast increase in legalization legislation at the state level and the echoes from Schumer's twitter feed about the very soon incoming reform legislation I'm finally ready to make my bet.

If you've kept up on the posts of my sub(I will not mention the name of my sub because that's not the point. I just needed a place where I knew my posts would NOT BE REMOVED.) you'll see I'm pretty consistent about watching Schumer's moves and also the new state legislation. All the news is good news. I want to cover one data point that I haven't really mentioned in the past. Schumer in 2018 introduced the MORE act. It obviously didn't go anywhere with McConnel running the senate but this is a very different situation. It is my firm belief that Schumer will actually do what he says he's going to do. The interesting data point about MORE act in 2018 was that it was introduced on the most meme date: April 20th.

I think Schumer is going to be apart of the meme and reintroduce legislation on this day next week. I also expect to see more robust edition of the legislation that handles many of the concerns of both the right and the left with regards to gracefully transitioning to a legal cannabis market.

Schumer Wyden and Booker worked together to build something so I am concluding that it's extensive, robust and addresses concerns around the war on drugs and the effects on POC in the United States.

There are some concerns around risk of the vote passing and avoiding it going nowhere due to filibuster. After doing research on the senators on the right wing and also watching unexpected support for the SAFE act I am now convinced that the legislation will be passed in the Senate this year.

I have covered every concern I've had about cannabis in my past posts be it on my sub largely or on r/wallstreetbets. If you want to see some of my DD go look for it. I'm not cross posting or linking them.

# My Expectations

I expect the announcement on the 20th next week and a sharp price movement upward. The following day there may be a selloff as there are always scalpers to shake out the FOMO buyers. I expect the price to either stagnate or slowly rise until the legislation ultimately pass and then a sharp selloff of 10-20%. This will be the day traders / short term traders exiting for profit.

I think it's fair to expect at least a 25% increase in the price of MSOs and relevant ETFs that carry those holdings. (MSOS and some yolo holdings). Yes I'm speculating and no that isn't a math-derived number. MSOS currently sits at $40. It has taken hits over the past few months as pretty much the whole market.

I think the whole sector will jump but ultimately non multi state operators will see a brutal selloff depending on what's in the bill. My expectation with the legislation is that MSOs and smaller competitors will be the greatest beneficiaries. POC and people who want to enter the sector on a small retail end will be considered in the bill as they historically were a target of the war on drugs and will likely see special consideration in the bill.

Why?

Licensing isn't going away. This bill will not make a 'wild-west' scenario where anyone can enter the market. Licenses aren't free and aren't unlimited. Each state will control who has a license to interact in the sector. This isn't new and I'd be completely shocked to see any reversal of this trend. More so the states are ultimately going to be in control of all of the rules give or take a few federal stipulations.

# My Bet

If you've followed my posts you'll see I'm already very long on MSOS and the industry as a whole. I will get calls for either May or June and hold them for a bit. I will before the final vote is taken get some puts. I expect the sell off so I expect to ride it up by entering calls before announcement of the legislation and getting puts before the vote as I expect a selloff. This will also help me insulate my self from some of the risk of holding a completely one sided position.

I simply don't have enough money to exercise all of the calls I can buy so I will be selling a large portion of the short term ones after announcement. The strike on my long calls will be around c50 or c55.

# In short my play

* Buy calls before week ending 4/16 (expiry either May or June depending on risk and price)
* Sell calls after 4/20
* Buy puts before the final vote is taken in congress
* Close puts after vote confirms legalization
* Buy shares with any profits I've made

Here's my current positions as I don't know exactly when I'll enter my new calls. obviously I'm doing it today.

There was a lot of media attention during the week of 4/20. So this may just be a quick flip before the actual vote for me.",

ms81qo,,wallstreetbets,post,1618593922,"Crunching some numbers on Moderna (MRNA) upcoming cash windfallI have had my eye on Moderna (MRNA) for a while and I decided to crunch some numbers on their upcoming windfall of cash from vaccine sales.  Let me start with I am not a financial adviser, I am just a lowly engineer who likes numbers.

**MRNA**

Projected sales for 2021 $18 billion (from MRNA last Quarter)

Projected doses sold in 2021 600 million to 1 billion

Price per dose $32-$38 per dose depending on how many you buy.

Just using these numbers MRNA will gross $19 billon to $38 billion.  This gives us an EPS of $46-$96.  At its current price the P/E ratio would only be 1.5-3.5!!  I know I am not figuring in costs but they cant be that bad.  I would guess $2-3 billion to ramp up production?

Moderna reports earnings on the 5th of May, I expect this to be a total blowout from what I can see above.

So why is the price so low still?  I am guessing that the fear of something going wrong with the vaccine  is still priced in.  If something goes wrong it would be catastrophic but so far so good!  I have yet to see any zombie reports...

**Why I am investing heavily in MRNA:**

\-I believe in the company.  I am double vaccinated with Moderna and everyone I know that had it had very mild side effects.

\-I believe in the science of what they are doing with messenger RNA.

\-Booster shot sales in the future?  AIDS vaccine?  CURE FOR CANCER??

Am I missing something here?  Please let me know what you guys think.",

If you don't know what the cost are you can't say they have a P/E of such and such.
