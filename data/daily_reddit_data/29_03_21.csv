Anyone have any interesting plays they’d like to share?

I looked into $SKLZ but wasn’t too impressed. I also considered buying the dips on MP Materials or Palantir and averaging down my current investments in those two but would be open to something new if anyone has something intriguing.

My core portfolio is solid so I’m just trying to play with these $500. Anything undervalued at the moment that you guys have your eyes on?",

mf7tae,,stocks,post,1616959270,"Unknown Stock Market Investor died with $188M in stocks and donated ALL TO CHARITYI am hoping people here take the time to read about Jack Macdonald - a man that lived frugally his whole life but invested in the stock market and left $188M to charitable organizations when he died in 2013. He was a lawyer living in Seattle, no one aside from a few close family members were aware of his wealth. He was fascinated by the stock market and thought of himself as shepherding over his wealth that would eventually go back to benefit the rest of society. 

Here are a few stories you can read about him:

[https://www.joshuakennon.com/add-jack-macdonald-list-secret-millionaires-just-died-left-188-million-built-investing-stocks-charity/](https://www.joshuakennon.com/add-jack-macdonald-list-secret-millionaires-just-died-left-188-million-built-investing-stocks-charity/)

[https://who13.com/news/secret-millionaire-seattle-man-lived-frugally/](https://who13.com/news/secret-millionaire-seattle-man-lived-frugally/)

I hope we all can take away something from this story - it is not about flashing your wealth. His story obviously is on an extreme, but everyone can take something away from the way he lived his life and looked at investing. 

For those that have made large gains this year, remember to give back to those that are less fortunate. Or, just keep investing that until you have $188M when you die - and then give that to charity to benefit others.",

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-29.html)

*****

> # 1. U.S. futures drop after Friday’s records for Dow, S&P 500

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Monday after a late-session rally Friday sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up over 1.4% and nearly 1.7%, respectively, as stocks benefiting from a successful Covid reopening outperformed, again. The Dow and S&P 500, which both closed at record highs, saw weekly gains about equal to Friday’s advances. Dow stock Boeing rose 3% in Monday’s premarket after a huge aircraft order from Southwest Airlines. Southwest shares were up modestly.

> * The Nasdaq on Friday erased an almost 1% loss and closed up 1.2%. However, the tech-heavy index still declined about 0.6% for the week, with just three days left in March. The Nasdaq was tracking for a slight monthly loss, while the Dow and S&P 500 were poised to turn in solid gains for the month.

> * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Monday, trading below its recent 14-month high. The rapid rise in yields this year has been troublesome for growth stocks, many of them tech names, as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Credit Suisse, Nomura take hit from U.S. hedge fund fallout

> * Credit Suisse warned Monday of a “highly significant” hit to its first-quarter results, after the Swiss-based bank began exiting positions with a large U.S. hedge fund that melted down on margin calls last week. Japanese firm Nomura said it’s evaluating a potential loss estimated at $2 billion. Shares of Nomura and Credit Suisse were getting slammed in Monday’s premarket.

> * The hedge fund at the center of the fallout is Archegos Capital Management, which was forced to liquidate positions at the end of last week. The moves by the multibillion dollar U.S. family office, founded by former Tiger equity analyst Bill Hwang, caused a wave of selling pressure Friday in U.S. media stocks and Chinese internet ADRs.

*****

> # 3. Ever Given cargo ship blocking Suez Canal is partially floated

> * The giant Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal was partially refloated early Monday, days after the vessel got stuck and brought a vital global trade route to a standstill. The Suez Canal Authority said the ship’s course has been corrected by 80% and further maneuvers will resume when the water level rises later in the day. It remains unclear when waterway will reopen to traffic as hundreds of ships are backed up and waiting to enter the Suez. Maritime data showed at least ten tankers and container ships changed course to avoid the logjam, including U.S. ships carrying natural gas for Cheniere and Shell/BG Group.

*****

> # 4. Biden to push infrastructure before health and family care

> * President Joe Biden will separate his sprawling plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure into two separate pieces. Biden on Wednesday will unveil the first part of his plan, focusing on items like rebuilding roads and railways. The second part of the president’s plan — including child-care and health-care reforms, aspects of what’s sometimes called social infrastructure — will be released in “in just a couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday in an interview. Taken as a whole, the legislation is expected to cost more than $3 trillion.

*****

> # 5. Fauci warns U.S. only ‘at the corner’ of Covid pandemic

> * With the possibility of safer summer barbeques just a few months away, along with the promise of widespread Covid vaccine supply in the U.S. by the end of May, many Americans may be feeling as though the nation has finally turned the corner on the pandemic. However, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that America is really only “at the corner.”

> * New daily U.S. cases, while sharply lower than January’s high, increased 12% in the past seven days compared to a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly half of people ages 65 and older have completed all of their necessary shots, according to CDC data. However, just 20% of the adult population is considered fully vaccinated.

mfqogf,,stocks,post,1617027893,"IRM - iron mountains is a data storage company which used to focus on physical storage but is starting to transition into digital storage.
I bought one share a few months ago just to get a feel for the stock, but haven't made any further purchases since. If I buy it I buy to hold, not to trade.

It's a very high risk, high dividend play (dividend is around 7%, and they use debt to finance it).

Does anyone here own IRM? What do you think of their chances of surviving the transitions & competition in digital storage?",['IRM']
mfqogf,gsowi10,stocks,comment,1617028670,I have owned Irm on and off since @97. During its growth phase it was absolutely fantastic. They have been doing optical imaging and digital storage since the 90’s. They focus on hiring veterans specifically officers for key operations management positions. They still risk fire concerns on their hard copy storage. But their business model is great. They charge storage for hard copy even of the customer requests their boxes sent back to them. Their hard copy facilities can be above capacity and still collect fees at 100-120 percent of capacity. They make pennies per storage but dollars to withdraw. I think it’s a good investment.,['IRM']

(digital copies of SOP's and things of that nature). their ftp server and documentation forms are easy to use and their customer service is great.

once i saw someone recommend them on a youtube video as a good dividend stock, i immediately knew who they were and did some more research into the company. once i saw that 95% of fortune 1000 companies use IRM's services, it felt like a no brainer that this was a smart pickup at the depressed spring 2020 prices.

having worked with them as a customer, and having held them as an investor, i have no reservations about the company whatsoever and plan to increase my holdings when i have some spare cash to do so.",['IRM']

mfs7dp,,stocks,post,1617032162,"Stock Scraper Update as of 03/29/21**LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit?usp=sharing) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter).

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit.
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks

Have people read the description of Ecellix's eCell technology? Ecellix is Romeo's strategic partner. My gut feeling is that Ecellix can do what QS is claiming, and they are way ahead of QS considering they are working with Romeo to get their cells tested and moving forward with packing. They must be working on packing their cells already if they went ahead with partnering with Romeo. Ecellix just does not call it ""Solid state battery"". In fact, QS is not completely solid state. They use liquid to some extent. If Romeo/Excellix can move trucks, then it would be a cake to move passenger cars. With BorgWarner backing up Romeo, it will turn VW's vision upside down. GM, Ford, etc will come to BorgWarner/Romeo/Ecellix. Guess who would want it the most even if it has to pay high price. FISKER

That said, I’m going to start getting paid soon ($64,000 annually) and will eventually be making a decent living as a doctor.  I want to find an index fund to invest in in the long term.


At present, I bank with fidelity and like some of their options (FSSNX and FZROX).  They both have low expense ratios and are cheap to get into/ maintain since I have an account with fidelity.  They also have decent diversity, with FSSNX being a bit less technology-heavy than FZROX.  I’m leaning more towards FSSNX over FZROX because it’s been around for longer, has higher diversity, and in my opinion less overall risk.

Per your questions on index funds to invest in.  Your right at the start of your career so frankly this is when your supposed to be taking more risk than less.  

What people ignore is that lower risk and more diversified = lower returns.   So, given you have an excellent stable job in front of you, i would be looking at index etfs that give you very long term upside.  Traditionally this has been growth etfs.  However there are many types of growth etfs.  

Personally i would stay away from the Ark etfs given your risk scenario and frankly i think that Cathy Wood is hallucinating when she says that Tesla is going to be work 3.6 trillion dollars in a couple of years

But if you want small cap just go 100% FSSNX, you really can't go wrong since you don't have a lot of money yet, its more important to build up savings than maximum returns.

Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in ‘unprecedented’ block trade selloff – mediaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly sold $19 billion worth of shares in Chinese tech and US media companies. Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. 

Continue...

“I’ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,” portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg. 
Senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move “highly unusual,” adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.
Another issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with “forced deleveraging,” the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don’t know “whether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.”","['VIAC', 'MS']"

**As always, please do your own research before investing into any security, and only invest what you can afford to lose.**

# Why have the markets been volatile?

A few things have been at play to cause the market to both go up, and down.

* Doubts growing around the vaccine roll-out, fuelled by export bans from the EU and India, along with the looming threat of a 3rd wave in Europe, saw bond yields dip earlier in the week. This helped support the price of growth/tech stocks earlier in the week.
* Tensions between the US and China increased, and US regulators renewed their threats to delist Chinese stocks quoted in the US. This saw Chinese tech giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba all drop significantly *(there’s actually a bit more to this story now, rumour has it that a hedge fund or family office blew up last week, creating a fire sale).*
* Energy stocks & related commodities shot-up as a massive ship blocked the Suez canal, blocking the fastest shipping route linking Europe and Asia.
* Quarter-end rebalancing for many asset-management firms will see a flow out from equities to bonds, as many have to maintain proportions of equities-to-bonds in their portfolios, which would have been thrown out of whack given the rally stocks have been on since the start of the year.Money put into stocks was at its lowest since Dec 20 ($4.1Bn) while money flowing into cash instruments was at its highest since Apr 20 ($45.6bn), [TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) saw its third largest inflows ever.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-flows-bofa/investors-rush-into-cash-at-fastest-pace-since-april-2020-bofa-idUSKBN2BI16H?il=0)

# What does this mean for the weeks ahead?

Definitely more volatility, especially as COVID outlooks yo-yo. Prices likely to dip lower, particularly for the highly overvalued growth stocks (EV anyone?) and a continued rotation from tech/growth stocks into cyclical stocks and inflation-protected bonds.

# What about the longer term?

The outlook is better. A return to normal *(how many times have you heard that saying now?)* is now more tangible, as more vaccines get announced and administered *(*[*Biden has doubled targets to 200m doses in his 100 days in office*](https://www.ft.com/content/a1accbdf-0010-426c-9442-feb73b5c8a1d)*, UK have confirmed they are on target to offer a vaccine to all adults by July, with nearly half already administered a first dose)*. After all, the whole worry of rising inflation is due to rapidly recovering economies.

This makes these few weeks a perfect opportunity to research and pick out some long term prospects, to purchase at these subdued prices and hold through the volatility.

To help you do that, i’ve researched up and coming sectors, and likely players in that field to help give you some inspiration. Now just because a stock is on this list does not mean it’s a good investment choice, but it’s a good place to start looking.

# Cloud computing

**What is it?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking and software over the internet. Typically, You only pay for the services you use, and can obtain extra resources or computing power within minutes, meaning quicker set-up and lower operating costs with more flexibility.

**Why should I be excited?**

Cloud computing has seen tremendous growth over the last decade. Revenues grew from $197Bn in 2018 to $266Bn just 2 years later. This is forecasted to grow to $354Bn by 2022 as take-up scales.

Cloud computing is already a go to solution for internet services like large websites (Reddit), content delivery platforms (Netflix, Spotify) and start-ups. This is driven by its simplicity, flexibility, cost advantages and an ever-growing number of solution services ([AWS offering pre-built fraud detection solutions for example](https://aws.amazon.com/fraud-detector/?nc2=h_ql_prod_ml_fd)).

Larger, more traditional corporations have been also making the move to cloud computing, albeit at a slower pace. This could be due to security hesitancy *(worries of hacks, leaks etc)*, legal requirements *(GDPR requires personal data to be stored in the same jurisdiction, FDA has stringent requirements for cloud usage)* or the right solution not available currently.

These barriers are reduced constantly as the sector advances, meaning take up of cloud becomes easier, and more necessary, as computing requirements increase.

Additionally, with increasing internet bandwidth and speed across the world, new cloud solutions also become more feasible. Take **cloud gaming** for example. Rather than having to build and maintain your own gaming PC, [Shadow](https://shadow.tech/en-gb/) provide a high-end PC to play with, streamed over your internet connection, all for a minimal monthly fee. Since the company maintain the infrastructure, in a few years time when more powerful PC parts come out, they will upgrade that infrastructure for you.

**Relevant Stocks**

* Amazon (AMZN)
* Microsoft (MSFT)
* Google (GOOGL)

No cloud computing list is complete without the 3 stocks above, between them and their services (AWS, Azure and GCP) they absolutely dominate the cloud market.

* Digital Ocean (DOCN)
* Salesforce (CRM)
* DataDog (DDOG)
* Cloudflare (NET)
* Twilio (TWLO)
* Dropbox (DBX)

# Clean energy

**What is it?**

Clean energy is useful energy that is collected from renewable, zero emission sources, most of which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

There is a large crossover between clean and renewable energy sources, although they are not the same. Uranium for example is classed a clean energy source *(due to low atmosphere pollution)* but is not renewable.

**Why should I be excited?**

This one is pretty obvious, globally people are moving towards more sustainable uses of the Earth’s resources, to ensure we don’t damage the planet even more.

Governments are becoming more stringent with energy regulations, and companies are now measured by ESG standards *(Environmental, Sustainable and Governance).*

As clean energy technology improves, it will without a doubt become more widely used and adopted. It has rapidly picked up over the last year, accelerated by Biden being voted into power, and a funding frenzy meaning more capital is being pumped in than ever before.

This extract from the FT summarises the breadth of this sector well:

>From [new battery storage technologies](https://www.ft.com/content/fb1fa29b-7f2b-448b-ba47-05f16eccad97) to sustainable aviation fuel, lab-grown meat and low-carbon concrete, investors are rushing to put money behind [renewable energy producers and other companies fighting climate change](https://www.ft.com/content/0a3d0af8-7092-44c3-9c98-a513a22629be).

Michael J Burry has also recently gone in on clean energy, through Uranium holdings, [here is a good post discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4w42/michael_burry_appears_to_shift_focus_to_clean/).

**Relevant stocks**

* URA
* URNM
* NLR
* ICLN
* TAN
* BEP
* Nextera (NEE)

The majority of these are ETFs, which would be my suggested way of investing into clean energy, given that most of the companies in this sector are still immature, and you would need to allocate a large amount of time into researching them to select the right one.

# Genetic therapy and genomics 

**What is it?**

Genetic therapy is an approach that uses a person’s genes to treat or even prevent diseases. There are several different types of therapy, such as replacing a mutated, disease-causing gene with a healthy version, getting rid of a mutated gene that isn’t working properly and even introducing a new gene into the body to fight off diseases.

**Why should I be excited?**

While still in very early stages, and likely to take the longest to develop compared to the other sectors I’ve discussed, this one can have tremendous pay-off.

So far, two therapies have managed regulatory approval, Novartis’ Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy, and Spark’s Luxturna for a rare form of genetic blindness. More are waiting their turn. To give you an idea of the magnitude of diseases gene therapy can solve, here are some recent developments:

* Earlier in the year, German scientists reported they were able to use gene therapy to [help paralyzed mice run again](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/europe/german-scientists-made-paralysed-mice-run-again-through-gene-therapy.html). 
* Chinese scientists develop gene therapy which could [reverse the effects of ageing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-genes-ageing-idUKKBN29P02V).
* Trials are ongoing with CRISPR technology to[ tackle leukemia and lymphoma](https://synbiobeta.com/crispr-clinical-trials-a-2021-update/)

**Relevant stocks**

* CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)
* Invitae Corp (NVTA)
* Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)
* Agilent Technologies (A)
* Editas Medicine (EDIT)
* Bio-Rad (BIO)

# Artificial Intelligence

**What is it?**

Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

Artificial General intelligence (AGI) which attempts to emulate a more broad level of intelligence, similar to humans, is still a fair way away.

However, Narrow Artificial Intelligence (what most people refer to when mentioning today’s technology) which is good at performing a specific task, like [playing a game of poker](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/145), or [faking videos of Tom Cruise](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/deepfake-videos-of-tom-cruise-show-just-fast-its-improving), has come on leaps and bounds, and is an area of both massive funding and development.

**Why should I be excited?**

AI has already become an integral part of technology solutions. Ranging from recommending Youtube videos, powering FaceID and enhancing photos to self-driving tech, property heating optimisation and trade execution optimisation.

Believe it or not, the technology is still relatively young, the first working deep learning algorithm being purchased by Google in 2012 *(oh, you don’t believe it was that recent?* [*read this article then*](https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/)*).*

There is still a tremendous amount of potential to be gained from AI algorithms, with uses in pretty much every industry imaginable, from manufacturing, to health care and social media.

**Relevant stocks**

This one is trickier than you think, lots of companies use AI, but there aren’t many *pure-play AI* stocks, especially since up and coming technology tends to get purchased by the big players at early stages.

ETFs in such a fast moving world would be a good option in this case.

* IBM (IBM)
* Palantir (PLTR)
* Baidu (BIDU)
* C3.ai (AI)
* ARKQ
* IRBO

mfuqc9,,stocks,post,1617039006,"Read If U Want To Be Rich: Buying Archesgos' Assets (BIDU and VIAC) 

Dear people,

WSB removed my post, so here I am.

The King is back with another great DD. Check my track record on here, I'm undefeated and I plan to stay that way.

Last week, we saw an idiot go tits up in true WSB fashion, affecting the PB's they did business with. This sent many, many stocks freefalling from ATH's in TMT stocks that they held, including VIAC, BIDU, DISCA, TME, IQ, etc. while pumping S&P stocks because the short positions Archegos held had to be bought back to close out their fund. Who was the idiot that led the charge? A boy named Bill Huang, a Tiger Cub and blatant price manipulator who was levered 5-6x to 1. **Countless success can turn a man arrogant and greedy, which is what I plan to capitalize on.**

I'm here to argue the case that the PB's who liquidated Archegos' holdings, did so with disregard of the stocks' value in relation to price.

Before I begin to make my case, I ought to go over the near-term risks associated with opening positions in BIDU and VIAC or any of the stocks that Archegos held positions in, which is contagion risk. Because of the huge sell off in these names and the fact that MM's who invest in TMT tend to invest in all the same asset type, more margin calls can be triggered over the next 2-4 weeks before managers with loads of cash start loading up on these names. So my advice is to load up carefully, unlike Bill Huang, and you will be rich.

Now let's get to it then with **Catalysts and Fundamentals** for two of my favorite names Archegos was in: **BIDU AND VIAC**

Baidu (BIDU);

**Catalysts:**

**Baidu's Apollo (Level 4 autonomy) and robotaxis**

\-Started its launch in Beijing and has received its first driverless testing permit in California and its 199th driverless permit in China.

\- Plans to begin mass production of Kunlun II AI chip later this year, which will be in direct competition with NVDA's chip for autonomous domination in the car market.

**Baidu plans to start an EV car company with cars rolling out in 2024.**

**56.2% ownership stake in IQiyi, China's Netflix**

\-Currently valued at $7.7Billion

\-At IQ's recent high of $30, stake would be worth $13 Billion

**Acquisition of YY Live for a measly $3.6Billion will leverage the company's bread and butter of advertising expertise once they acquire the social media app and other assets**

**Baidu Core revenue for Q1 2021 will grow between 26% and 39% year over year.**

\-Ad revenue is Baidu's cash flow generating machine which has allowed the company to venture into other areas as mentioned above. Their core business is returning to growth and FCF will be strong.

**Fundamentals:**

21x trailing P/E or $3.4billion in net income with $1.4 billion coming from the appreciation of their long term investments, or stakes in companies like IQIYI

2020 FCF of $2.9Billion

Forecasting 10-20% full year revenue growth as China returns quicker than the US due to low covid cases and the Chinese govt's bark will be larger than their bite as they will try to prop up their economy this year.

$5.5 billion in cash with a .74 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is beautiful.

ViacomCBS (VIAC);

**Catalysts:**

**Streaming service release with an expectation of an initial boom.**

**Share price has been absolutely battered this month, falling 50% from ATH's**

**Domestic Streaming & Digital Video Revenue Growth to 72% Year-Over-Year in Q4, Driven by Strong Streaming Subscription and Streaming Advertising Revenue**

**Fundamentals:**

11x trailing P/E or $2.6 billion in net income

FCF of $1.9 billion or 15x trailing

$3 billion in cash with a 2.0 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is normal for a media company.

Compared to DIS multiples, VIAC is extremely cheap and you get a free buy-in for their streaming service.

Positions:

Baidu: 9/21 $230c, 1/22 $230c

ViacomCBS: 4/21 $50c, 1/22 $50c

The main reason I am loading up here is because this is so reminiscent of what happened because of the mass defaults that occurred in the housing crisis we saw in the US in 07-09. The difference here is that the assets that were sold off were firm-specific to Archegos' holdings. Bill Huang may have been a cheater and extremely greedy, but due to the recent sell off at fire sale prices, I believe these two stocks that his family office held have tremendous upside. And as I said with my CRSR posting a few months ago, if you inverse me here, I will crush you.

mf6a9g,,stocks,post,1616954860,"I save my entire income and can't stop losing moneySorry for my english, it's not my first language. Disclaimer: ECH = IPSA. It's an index, not a company.

So I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera.

The thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.

A while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the ""year of recovery"", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i ""buy the dip"" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.

I honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.

How can I stop losing all of my income? Thanks.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: I'm adding some context on the chilean market below. I tried to be as concise as possible, I hope it's good enough.

I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.

2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.

It's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.

October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.

Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself ""it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!""

Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events.

That's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.

mf6a9g,gsltvxb,stocks,comment,1616957209,"Hang in there. I know it’s rough seeing your investments go down for so long, but I want to congratulate you on sticking to it for this long, you definitely got the right idea.

I took a look at IPSA, and although the IPSA haven’t done much in the past 10 years, but it’s up 8 times in the past 26 years, you would actually have done pretty well with a 30 year time horizon. Now I have no idea what is going on with the ECH. It seems to do a really bad job of actually tracking the index. Do you have any idea of why this is?

I don’t know anything about the economics of Chile, so you probably knows better then me if you should be bullish on the Chilean economy.

In any case I think you are doing the right thing by trying to diversify outside of Chile, to the best of your ability. If you can try and find a fund that tracks indexes from other countries, and be aware of fees or hidden costs. The fund (or fintech) could easily be ripping you off.

If you can’t diversify internally you might want to look into bond or other fixed income vehicles. I generally don’t recommend fixed income in the environment, but if you are limited to Chile and don’t think the economy is going anywhere, or they can’t attract international investors, fixed income might be your best option. You can also consider if investing in real estate is an option. You can also do a split between bonds and stocks.",

CC:  strong earnings rebound underway.  Stock is cheap based on estimates which are too low. Look forward company to beat expectations and stock to get re-rated higher.

IEC:  company is doing everything right.  Strong growth throughout Covid.  Wall Street ignores the stock due to small mkt cap and only 10.6 million shares outstanding.  Top and bottom line growth again this year.  This $13 stock can break $20 with a little retail interest and P/E expansion to market multiple.

OC:  Still trades at a huge discount to mkt despite strong earnings and even better outlook.  If there is a better/cheaper play in both reopening and red hot housing mkt, I haven’t found it!

TEVA:  Trades at a crazy low PE multiple due to overly pessimistic Opioid concerns.  CEO is engineering a trifocals turnaround and as trial dates get set post-Covid the pressure will be on to finally reach a long-delayed settlement.  Stock will soar in that news or even a hint that it is coming!

If you bought something planning to hold for years just get in if you like the price. Chalk it up to bad timing because buying dip at bottom is rare.

mftyop,gspiz71,stocks,comment,1617039051,"No there is nothing to say that.  What gets a fund (family office or hedge fund) in to trouble is if there is a sudden drop in value and that they are leveraged to the max when that happens.  There is no reason to believe that the max would be different from hedge funds.  When you are talking about this ""family office"" we are still taking about billions of dollars.  One might also assume the hedge funds being professionals and not a rich family may be less likely to leverage themselves so much.  This was a weird one off situation that affected a handful of stocks not the whole market.  It also happened because they owned such a significant portion of a few companies which probably isn't the case with most hedge funds.

I was curious if large brokerages (like Vanguard) deal with large currency impacts when it comes to international index funds. Specifically:

1. When Vanguard uses a US-domiciled fund like VTIAX to invest in equities on foreign stock exchanges, do they first exchange USD into that foreign currency before investing?
2. Then when those foreign equities issue dividends (presumably in foreign currencies), does Vanguard pay FX fees to convert those dividends back into USD to pay US investors?

How does Vanguard deal with all this FX risk / cost?

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

mf76ly,,stocks,post,1616957464,"What stocks and sectors would you bet on with a 2 years timeframe?Short term the market is unpredictable, and very long term also becomes increasingly difficult to prevede what will happen, because of the cumulative effect of future new events.

So what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?

I’m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.

Long Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.
I see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.

Getting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.

Travel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I’d be interested in finding good alternatives.

E-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.
MELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I’m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.

Still the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I’m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.

Shorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.

Admittedly a shorter timeframe, highly speculative bet, PSTH is tempting because of the fame of Ackman, and being back close to the initial offering price. SPACs are fast falling out of favor, yet this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of share price if a merger is announced.

Your thought on the above and other ideas?","['AMZN', 'PYPL', 'BA', 'AAPL']"

mf6kdm,,stocks,post,1616955654,"Jerome Powell and the 2% inflation promise. FOMC in a nutshell.On March 17, 2021 at the FOMC event, the FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated that he expect to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2024, even as the FED has upgraded their US growth forecasts because of a massive fiscal stimulus and an accelerating vaccine rollout.

 
Powell precisely refers to a ""…full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. 
… achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."" 

 
Further he adds that their ""…ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.""
So basically the unemployment rate is now forecast to fall to 4.5% by the end of the year instead of 5%. On the other side PCE inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% compared with the rise to 1.8% predicted in December.
But Fed officials expect the bump in consumer prices to be temporary, with PCE inflation falling back in 2022-2023, even as unemployment drops further.

 
 
And regarding to the federal funds rates the FED continues to ""expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 0.25 percent target range""
So they will continue to increase their ""holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month""

 
So the Fed has managed to maintain rock-bottom interest rates ""…with inflation running persistently below 2 percent"" in order to ""achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent"" until the US reaches full employment, with inflation hitting 2 per cent and being on track to exceed that target. The central bank also reiterated that it would continue to buy bonds at a rate of $120bn per month until “substantial further progress” was made.

 
And they ""will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.""
An approach similar to the famous Mario Draghi ""Whatever it takes"" to save Europe in 2012, from a deep economic crisis.

 
As a result of this policy the upgrades to the forecasts from Fed officials were significant. In fact back in December they predicted 4.2% growth this year, while now they have raised that estimate up to 6.5% (+2.3%), which would be the fastest economic expansion since 1984.

 
What we can say is that this sharp upgrade to the FED's summary of economic projections will certainly generate doubts to the central bank's dovish policy.

 
During his speech Powell reiterates many times that ""The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.""
And that the FED has provided essential support to households, businesses and communities, and the recovery in economic activity since last spring is due to ""an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions.""

 
He concludes by saying that the FED understands that ""our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission… and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible""

 
So this is what happened during the last FOMC event.

How do you find companies that don't exactly prioritize something, but would be well suited to tackle a job if it became a subject of public interest?

I'm looking to invest in companies that facilitate passenger rail transportation. Particularly, ""next-gen"" rail transportation. 

However I've had some trouble pinpointing what companies would be involved in rail passenger transportation. Most company profiles that I've read specify freight, but literally none of them mention passengers.

My rationale is that the Biden infrastructure plan will include initiatives in 

1. Clean energy, 
2. Innovation (buzzword), and 
3. Transportation. 

The US has a distinct lack of rail transportation that would provide incredible cost-efficient benefits. Rail is far more affordable in both the near and far term say the interstate road system. Additionally, it does not have as much detrimental environmental impact. So, it checks a lot of boxes.

I had to wonder if that advice in the OP came from your parents.

In reality I don’t think it matters much at all, assuming you can buy fractional shares. ‘Cheap’ shares might not move very much or even fall, while ‘expensive’ shares can still give you good gains. I don’t have much money invested but am still able to grow it by paying more attention to the possible percentage change in a stock rather than the absolute price.

mfexin,,stocks,post,1616981858,"ENPH Ensemble storage revenues priced in?When the stock market has such an aggressive pull back on the hot 2020 stocks (ie. green energy, cloud/SaaS, high tech growth, etc), it made me revisit my conviction with all the stocks I own.

This had me re-reading the ENPH Q4 annual report. In 2020, ENPH didn't sell any energy storage solutions. In their Q4, the 10K states that ENPH will introduce a new energy storage product called Ensemble.

https://investor.enphase.com/node/18836/html#ib51ac078944f40aabcb529ec51955ccf_409

> We expect further revisions of our storage products with Ensemble technology to be released in 2021, with a focus on the grid-agnostic IQ 8 PV microinverter for residential installations.

This is reinforced on their website:

https://enphase.com/en-us/ensemble-technology-enphase-installers


Looking at their 10K, its not very clear whether their storage solution is included in their revenue. Their supplemental data only covers microinverter system shipments:

> https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/5e9174b7-a787-4e4d-8d7b-307ce2813b77

But their annual report press release states that their Ensemble storage solution increased by 35%

Does anyone know how their storage solution is incorporated into their aggregate revenue? Also, does anyone have a feeling if the growth projections of their storage solution is priced into the stock price?

The PE ratio is currently at a monstrous ~150 with PS ratio of 25. With their market cap currently at $20B with annual revenue of $774M and net income of $133M.

ENPH has to see revenues increase by 20x to get to a reasonable PE ratio. Its not TSLA levels ridiculous, but its up there.","['ENPH', 'TSLA']"

mf31oa,,stocks,post,1616945472,"Why I am long DKNG (and you can too)I'll do my best to keep this tight and to the point but informative.

First, positions or ban. I ran the wheel on DKNG last summer but didn't dive too deeply into the company. In January, I bought 25 shares while it was trading \~58. I bought a Jan 2022 90C and June 2021 70C, and I sold those for premium after the rebound two weeks ago.

**What DKNG Is:** Draftkings is a mobile sports betting and daily fantasy sports app. Before sports betting was opened to state-by-state legalization in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court, Draftkings' product was daily fantasy sports games. This was a gray area in terms of betting, as DFS are pay-to-play games that pay out prizes to winners, and highly addicting. Draftkings now runs a sportsbook with future and live betting odds.

**Avaliable market:** Sports betting is currently legal in [14 states and D.C.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/13/is-sports-betting-legal-in-my-state.html), representing about 25% of the U.S. population. Many states are expected to legalize it in 2021 or 2022 by either a referendum on the ballot or legislative action. Texas, New York, and California would be massive boons for the betting market, as those states contain the overwhelming majority of the outstanding U.S. population that does not yet have legalized sports betting.

**Market prospects:** Nobody really knows. [An old estimate](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/firms-say-sports-betting-market-to-reach-8-billion-by-2025-2019-11-04) claims $8 billion in revenue for the betting industry by 2025. The industry is way too new in the U.S. But here are [some numbers](https://www.sportspromedia.com/from-the-magazine/us-sports-betting-market-gambling-revenue-states-2021-data) showing the state-by-state proliferation of sports betting (I want to point out for people not familiar with sports betting that $ wagered does not equal revenue -- money must be paid out to the winners. Book revenue is excess wagering not paid out to winners):

>In October 2020, Americans legally bet an estimated US$3 billion on sports for the first time in a single month, according to the American Gaming Association. Sports betting revenue was up nationwide by 53.5 per cent year-over-year to US$237.5 million. In December alone, New Jersey set the national sports betting record for the fifth consecutive month, taking an eye-watering US$996.3 million in bets.  
>  
>Naturally, the decimation of the global sporting calendar meant revenue for the broader gaming industry was down year-over-year, falling 33.5 per cent to US$24.12 billion by October. But it is a measure of betting’s proliferation that six states – Colorado, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Dakota – generated more income from wagering for that month compared to a year ago.

This all happened with a very weak sports calendar because of the pandemic. March Madness was canceled, MLB lost 60% of its season, and NHL and NBA saw long delays. With a full sports calendar in 2021, expect U.S. wagering to climb YOY even more.

**DKNG's prospects:** Like most tech startups, Draftkings is running at a loss. This is largely due to their large marketing outlay. Their revenue is steadily increasing every quarter. They smashed Q4 earnings expectations and [raised their 2021 outlook](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/draftkings-lifts-2021-outlook-4q-125335607.html) as a result:

>DraftKings’ co-founder and CEO Jason Robins said, “In the fourth quarter of 2020, we saw MUPs \[monthly unique payers\] increase 44% to 1.5 million and ARPMUP \[average revenue per monthly unique payer\] increase 55% to $65.”  
>  
>“We are raising our revenue outlook for 2021 due to our expectation for continued growth, the outperformance of our core business and newly launched states that were not included in our previous guidance,” Robins added.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The company raised its FY21 revenue guidance from a range of $750 million to $850 million to a range of $900 million to $1 billion, indicating year-on-year growth of between 40% to 55%. The revenue guidance is driven by the launch of online legal sports betting in the states of Michigan and Virginia and assumes that all professional and college sports events will take place as announced.

Draftkings has inked a new [partnership with UFC](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/draftkings-dkng-ufc-sportsbook-fantasy), and struck a [deal with DISH Network](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2021/03/dish-and-draftkings-introduce-first-of-its-kind-app-integration/?wpsrc=Organic&wpcn=Organic%20Search&wpscn=Google) that will integrate Dratkings sportbook on DISH interfaces, allowing people to bet on events directly on their TVs while they watch. Draftkings [maintains an exclusive partnership](http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/06/2074556/0/en/DraftKings-Expands-Exclusive-Partnership-with-Major-League-Baseball.html) with MLB, and it's my opinion MLB may want to promote fan engagement with Draftkings as a way to recover lost revenue resulting from the pandemic (MLB was the only major sports league to lose a majority of its season last year). Draftkings also has partnerships with many teams in the NFL, NHL, and NBA, though these are often short-term partnerships and team-by-team, not league-wide.

**Stock outlook:** DKNG started trading last April. Since then, the stock is up about 265%; it is up 42% YTD. The stock hit an intraday ATH of $74.38 last Monday, March 22, and closed the week at $63.60, about 14.5% off its ATH, as part of a larger swoon for tech stocks. The stock experienced choppy trading in 2020 but has been in a strong, 5-month uptrend that started at the beginning of November 2020. Localized volatility in DKNG seems to be part of the overall market anxiety that pounded tech this month. Still, it remains up 10% since that excellent Q4 ER before February 26 trading, and IMO presents a great buying opportunity in this zone.

Some [ETFs with major exposure](https://www.etf.com/stock/DKNG) to DKNG by % allocation or share count include BETZ, BJK, QQQN, ARKW, and VO (by most shares).

**Bear case:** Draftkings undoubtedly benefited from a pandemic-induced closure of in-person betting. Reopening plays that directly challenge Draftkings' market share are MGM, WYNN, and PENN. As casinos, table games, and sportsbooks reopen for in-person betting, that may sap gambling revenues away from mobile betting.

For Draftkings to continue growing at a pace that justifies its stock price, it will need to continue growing its user base. For that to happen, more states need to continue to legalize sports betting. While governments have rarely turned down opportunities to capture new tax revenue, some may still hesitate to do so on the backs of a vice like gambling. Like marijuana, gambling legalization seems to be gaining momentum. But a ballot measure that fails to pass, or a state legislature that fails to agree on legalized sports wagering (or how to allocate the revenues generated thereby) can slow Draftkings' continued growth.","['WYNN', 'MGM', 'DISH', 'DFS']"

# **The end of the quarter could create volatility for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/the-end-of-the-quarter-could-create-volatility-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks could be buffeted by end-of-quarter trading in the week ahead, as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios.
*****
> The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings, to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings.
*****
> The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House’s infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.
*****
> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.
*****
> “It’s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Obviously, we’ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They’re trying to figure it out.”
*****
> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.
*****
> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.
*****
> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.
*****
> “It’s in the driver’s seat right now,” said NatWest’s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.
*****
> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.
*****
> “If anything, we’re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,” he said.
*****
> # Infrastructure plan
> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.
*****
> “The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don’t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,” he said. “If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I’m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.”
*****
> Gwinn said the market has “fiscal fatigue.”

> “There’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it’s going to be passed, when it’s going to be passed and whether it’s going to be passed ... It’s not tangible enough,” he said.
*****
> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.
*****
> # Rotation
> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.
*****
> “I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.
*****
> “It’s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,” he said. “I think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that’s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.”
*****
> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.
*****
> “As we’re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,” he said. “To their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy — energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they’re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.

> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month – Up 15 in a Row

> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.

> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that “work-from-home” stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.

> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April’s performance since 1953. April is DJIA’s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.

> # Historic Year for the S&P 500

> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.

> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**

> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.

> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities

> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.

> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “After likely their worst period in history, although I wasn’t around for the bubonic plague so I can’t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn’t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.”

> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market’s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the “stay at home environment” benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December—even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.

> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.

> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**

> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low – actually it’s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.

> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn’t bad either.

> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals – and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA “Sell in May”).

> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let’s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means “bearish” perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.

mfc59w,,stocks,post,1616972217,"Resources to find tickers to research and tradeI really want to start forming my own ideas for trades and sourcing news and information myself to make swing trades, instead of relying on the due diligence of others. I am very familiar with fundamental and technical analysis, but where I fall short is finding a company to research in the first place. I use MarketWatch, Bloomberg, EDGAR filings, and others to see if I cant find companies reporting news, and I also use the Finviz stock scanner, but I feel that the scanner is geared more towards longer term investing. What I'm after are volatile, short term moves. 

So should I just look through 8-Ks and MarketWatch, and hope that something comes up? How would you suggest finding tickers to research for a short term play?",

mf4mql,,stocks,post,1616950173,"Looking at Timing of Stock InvestmentsThere are two ways thrive in stock markets. One is to pick right stocks. Another is to time one's investments right. Stock picking is somewhat simple to measure. You just compare your performance with an index of your choice. Beating index is good, losing to index not so. But how can you measure your timing?

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/8SS9R23) my attempt to visualize my timing success. I have sliced my stock history to half-year pieces and drawn how much and how profitably I have invested in each period. The farther back in time the investment goes, the bigger the profit bars should grow. Well, not quite in my case. This chart is not a clean picture of timing alone. 2010 - 2015 I did some pretty unfortunate stock picks and it shows here. Some periods have not broken even. Still, the chart has a story to tell. 2009 was a sweet time to enter market. 2020 looks good too.

I think market timing is a way of value investing for a person with my mental capacity. I have no skill or patience to calculate intrinsic values of companies. I really don't think I can judge a company better than all the wise people playing the same game. As the picture shows, my stock picks can be horrific. However, I can recognize market crash when one comes. It is kind of easy - indexes go down 30% or more. In the bottom of the crash it seems that almost any stock is a winner. I don't even need to hit the lowest spot of the crash. The time window for good buys is wide. This is borrowing a page from Benjamin Graham. This is exploiting Mr. Market in his most depressed mood.",

Last April, oil futures went negative which created the ""Tanker Gang."" Shooting to meme status was one tanker stock, $NAT and the stock ran from under $3/share to $9/share in weeks.

Most longtime tanker investors hate on $NAT because their CEO is a promoter and goes on Cramer. They don't like the fact their Suezmax ships are old and think their book value is overstated due to the age of their ships. Book value doesn't mean much for an operating company that's not in danger of bankruptcy. It's profits, cashflow and ability to service debt that really counts. They're able to keep these old ships running, even using the latest low sulphur fuels and pay most profits earned as dividends. They're basically the slumlords of tankers and if you've ever been involved in real estate, you know those slums cash flow much better than Trump level properties.

Nevertheless, tanker stocks generally suck and tanker gang got burned after oil futures trading returned to normal.

We like short dated options plays on the tanker with the greatest meme power.

Do what you will with this information. This is gambling, not investing and we don't provide financial advice.

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.  


**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

I'm not going to discredit it, but the only reliable leading indicator from what I've read is yield curve inversion.

the charts are misleading because during a a depression or reccession  the p/e goes up because company profits drop rapidly. A high p/e while  company profits are still rising is bullish

So its currently overvalued cause they expect even more profits

what do you think about?",
mez87a,gskmskb,stocks,comment,1616931158,"The Schiller P/E can tell you a lot, you just have to think about why the P/E was or was not high at a certain time. The recession and the high values resulting from low profits are not quite correct. During dotcom bubble was not an economic crisis, the prices for the companies were just extremely high. In addition, the key interest rate also influences the level of the value, low interest rates lead to high values.

Of course, it is also questionable to what extent the composition of the S&P500 has an influence on the value. More and more tech stocks (which on average have a high P/E) make up large parts of the entire index. Since this is a cross-sectional data panel, this effect is not taken into account here. The Schiller P/E can therefore very well say something, but only in combination with other findings and influences.",['SPGI']

If you just want managed funds available to most (ie not hedge funds) then you have mutual funds or eft’s main difference is mutual funds have higher fees because they are actively managed meaning if there’s a big market downturn or fluctuations they have some control over mitigation of loss. EFTs are not actively managed so the % in fees is a lot less but during extreme fluctuations they tend to just hold positions.

How confident and enjoyable do LT stock investors in let's say just 10 years ago feel about investing today? There are many new companies/stocks today with promising futures.  However, they are still in their infancy stage with pricing which make them more affordable to be tampered with volume wise. Tampered by today's technology, algorithms, Social Media, HFs, shorters (etc).... all manipulating and compromising true S/P not allowing organic growth with real value based on all technicals you would normally use. For new investors such as I, not only do I feel LT investing is a gamble, but there is an incredible amount of shadiness. Back to my examples in manipulating above. 

I truly feel I have picked very good LT plays but what I've seen is so blatantly bizarre happening in the stock market, that it has me very skeptic.  Organic growth feels almost 1 in a million to achieve.

meurpj,gskd3gg,stocks,comment,1616921832,"I think the market, that is the conglomerate of ""retail"" individuals and ""institutional"" investors, is still the very same to the core. But now augmented by much more technology.

Algorithm Trading, HF Trading and the like are way more accessible to the ""institutional"" part of the market - that's the perceived ""edge"" they have. I hope this will change soon as smart individuals are hopefully working on smart invest AIs across the globe for people to have access to these trading algos on an everyday basis if they choose to.

What always existed, to my very limited knowledge, is:

\- *Informed Professionals* who are closer to some information or closer ""to the market"", aka Traders sitting at Market Makers, Analysts with direct lines and more real time access who can execute a trade in seconds, not minutes.

As an analogy to the very far past: think back to the roaring 1920s. Stock trading was a fad. However, ""Telegraphs"" delayed the ticker values by several minutes even outside the stock exchange where actual trading was executed. Today you sit at a Bloomberg terminal or your brokerage account and push a button almost in real time to buy at a certain price. The people sitting at trading desks have more direct access. This has changed vastly though as you can also get ""Level 2"" data nowadays as an individual investor. The gap is closing.

\- *Dark Pools* in one or the other way

\- *""Behind Closed Doors"" trading* (related to the above) by direct deal making. Think big instituational money lenders and the acquisition of direct Warrants, exchangable to shares under certain conditions.

\- *Whale Investors* who can influence and play the system as they know more than the individual investor (not sure that is still true in terms of knowledge, but certainly in access to analysis with more data or professionalism) or they simply have more weight on share prices when they decide to move

The ""Short Game"" has been literally played since ages ago, you can read up all about it in literature.

The long game, however has never changed and proven by Grantham and Buffet to be a very, if not *the* most successful way to be ""in the game"".

Now, how you place investments is for you to decide.

The simple way is to ""set and forget"" your bets in solid companies that you believe will further your investment and grow their value by doing the right moves, investing in the right technology and people to grow their overall business and build technological moats around them to gain an edge long term.

So if your time horizon for investing is set to 15-30 years, the long game is what wins you money.

If you're in the short, volatility, swing trading game, prepare to be rattled and stressed by your investing decisions, as this is a full-time job.

One most people actually can't do because, you know, they have a real life job that is not ""Analyst"" or ""Investment Banker"".",['GPS']
meurpj,gsjymg7,stocks,comment,1616908776,"I remember being on the trading floor 10-15 years ago, and the older guys saying back then that the market doesn't make sense anymore. Technology is always advancing trading possibilities, and there are always going to be really smart people out there who think way outside the box.

As far as specific stocks, I've always said one of the hardest things about stock trading is knowing what stocks are out there. I let the indexes sort out what stocks have legs from those that don't. The nasdaq 100 is the top tech index, those are your solid blue chips. 100 stocks isn't too difficult to keep track of. One obv drawback to following an index is yeah, you might miss a new ipo that 🚀 but once you are used to watching a list, reading the news about upcoming releases makes sorting through easier. 

Trading & investing will always be there and will always be subject to advancing technology. Algos will probably be more available for individual investors in 10yrs and things that I can't imagine will be out there as well. 

If you stick to blue chips you certainly won't regret it. Let the index makers do their thing and they will help you sift through all the thousands of stocks. When aapl stops being a good investment, well, that's a scarry thought.","['NDAQ', 'AAPL']"

Financial.
Not bad. Strong balance sheet, at the end of 2020, they have 8.6 B cash, far exceeding its total debt of 3.6 B; another advantage of having tons of cash is they are ready to deploy once potential acquisition exists.
The business makes cash, but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance. It becomes normal these days?


Management.
The increasing number of shares. Need an explanation about this.
Cost analysis: nothing’s suspicious. Good figure of gross profit margin, a good figure of net profit margin. Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.

Its PE ratio is similar to EA. I’m surely going to EA due to a stronger economic moat.

this is the most wall street analysis of a gaming company ever lol

I'm not gonna mention activision's immense library of titles as well because I don't know that side of the company as well but...

Blizzard has some of the most valuable intellectual property in video games, right up there with Halo/God of War/Last of Us and they're very experienced in effectively monetizing their platforms. Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are some of the most anticipated games of the next two years and will likely be played for an entire decade (assuming all goes well). There are literally entire sports leagues dedicated to the games blizzard creates (Hearthstone, OW, SC2 for awhile) noting that it's **very** difficult to build and sustain a competitive league for so many games. 

However i do agree there are plenty of problems with the company as well, namely a lack of recent innovation and several misteps engaging their community. I think I'm still bullish on the ""soul"" of the company as a whole and would buy for the long run (assuming OW2 and Diablo review well)",['EA']

mfkoyj,,investing,post,1617005626,"BREAKING: NeuroRX (BRPA) Announces Successful Phase 3 COVID Drug Trial ResultsUp until now, covid treatments have provided minimal efficacy, and that’s if given near the initial onset of the infection, where they have the highest probability of working.

Today, NeuroRX (Ticker:BRPA) has announced successful top line results from their phase 3 Zyesami drug trial, which proved a nearly 50 percent increase in survival and recovery from respiratory failure vs. existing covid treatments (best standard of care). And that’s when the drug is administered to patients that have already reached severe/critical covid.

&#x200B;

**FDA Approval**

* NeuroRX is immediately applying for Emergency Use Authorization to get this drug to the people who need it. They already have a stockpile of the drug ready, along with manufacturing and distribution agreements. The CEO of NeuroRX has previously led drug developments for companies like Pfizer and Merck, and was appointed healthcare leadership roles by several different presidential administrations. He is the real deal.

**Nebulized form**

* The drug is administered via IV to hospitalized patients, however NeuroRX has already begun another trial to test an inhaled form of the drug, which is given via nebulizer and designed for use at home/outpatient setting. This could be even bigger than the IV form of the drug, because it could prevent moderately sick patients from ever becoming hospitalized in the first place. And now that the drug has proven it works in the IV form on severe/critical patients to reverse lung damage, the inhaled form which is administered directly to the lungs is even more promising for the moderately sick.

**“BuT cOviD is gOnE!!!!11”**

* While we’ve likely seen the worst of covid, it is not gone and never will be. Especially not in developing countries. Covid for example, is significantly more contagious than the flu. Even here in the US we might not reach herd immunity, plus mutations, people will get tired of getting a vaccine at least once, more likely twice a year etc.
* Additionally, the possible uses for this drug go beyond covid, such as respiratory distress syndrome. There are people who were on queue to receive a double lung transplant because of the damage covid did to their lungs, then were given this drug and a transplant was no longer needed. I believe covid treatment is only the beginning.

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter). 

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to 

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit. 
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

mfbyli,,investing,post,1616971610,"Investing in Helium - DMEHF DD **Investing in Desert Mountain Energy (DME.V, DMEHF)**

Due Diligence

**Why Helium?**

* Helium is a Non-renewable, non-synthesizable element that is an irreplaceable component of many growing, high tech industries - MRI magnetics, cloud storage, rocketry, semiconductors, nuclear power, and fiber optics, just to name a few. When used as a coolant and in many manufacturing aspects, there is no substitute.
* Helium is rare on Earth. It is only obtainable by drilling for gas reserves in very particular parts of the world.
* Helium is a $10+Billion industry with a CAGR of 4% (2018 prediction) - 11% (2020 prediction) (sources conflict as the Helium industry is highly concentrated currently with little transparency). Helium overperformed 2015 future-looking estimates by 150%.

**Why Now?**

* Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon: [https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf](https://imgur.com/a/QgUrnCf)
* The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been a major player in the Helium industry, accounting for nearly 20% of the global market. However, it was directed to privatize starting in 1996 and will be ending the majority of activity in 2021 having exhausted storage that has existed since the ‘60s, leaving a void in supply. **It’s not every day that a 20% player in an industry just exits the market.**
* Nearly all helium production today comes as a by-product of Natural gas extraction (constituting <1% of gas extracted). The move away from carbon fuels may further constrain helium supply as a consequence.

**Why Desert Mountain Energy (DME)?**

* DME is one of the only companies concentrating exclusively on helium production.
* DME operates in Arizona - the same area the US BLM found mining success in.
* Strong, experienced company leadership that have led multiple mining projects.
* Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining.
* DME is far ahead of all of the other helium-specific mining operations that are just starting to catch on (RHC, Helium One), and in a much better location.

**Why is Arizona Important**

* Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day.
* DME has hit significant Helium on 3/3 test wells drilled.
* Shipping and selling locally is important as gaseous helium can escape storage over time. Local industries include everything from SpaceX to Intel, which recently announced a $20B project to build semiconductor factories close to DME’s property.
* Other major helium players globally are in less stable locations or locations that don’t have strong US relations: Algeria, Qatar, Russia.
* The majority of land DME holds is private, meaning less regulation and quicker time to market.

**Financials and Plans**

* Strong cash on hand via private placement rather than private debt. $13M. Cash on hand used to procure land for both drilling and processing, and for equipment and transportation.
* Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less.
* Current market cap \~$128M, with the vast majority of retail/private ownership.
* Helium is extremely profitable once the operation is up and running. Analysts at Cormark expect DME to operate at 85% net of operating expenses.
* The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices. DME plans to drill 60 - 70 wells over this timespan. Even at conservative yields, we can expect order of magnitude increases to their revenue and market cap over the next decade.
* DME plans to process Helium and concentrate on high-grade Helium which has much higher yields than bulk helium (and is less or irreplaceable in its uses, such as cooling), further specializing operations.
* DME has other projects/holdings - namely land in OK for an oil play, but is concentrating on helium in Arizona right now.

**What’s Next?**

* Test results from wells 4-6 coming in the next few months
* Revenue and contract information towards the end of year.
* My opinion is that It’s entirely possible DME is acquired by a high-usage player local to the Arizona area.

**Risks?**

* Governmental effects, both nationally and locally. For example, the US leveraged helium politically by restricting exports to China in 2015, and if prices were to get out of control they could reverse course on privatization, though there are no indications of this now. (Quite the opposite, actually).
* Locally, the city of Flagstaff was granted a restraining order on DME to prevent drilling on one testing site due to concerns about the local water table (though misleadingly claimed they were fracking, which they are not). The vast majority of DME’s land is procured on private sources away from Flagstaff and is unaffected by this.
* Flow rates could be less successful at their other drill sites. I’ve been very conservative due to this in my future valuation calculations.
* There is barely any institutional ownership of the stock, which could be good or bad depending on which resources you consult.
* Other global supply coming online in the coming years. Largely in areas without close trade ties to the US, and offset by DME’s domestic concentration.
* A large player could ramp up supply to specifically push out the little guy. This would be difficult though. Since other helium production is a by-product of natural gas, this would mean flooding that primary market, which would have harsh consequences.

**My position**

* 2100 shares, continuing to add.
* IMO, this is a long term hold (3 - 5 years), not a short term flip. Expect volatility around this year’s catalyst events. Very conservatively I see this as hitting $20/share over this timeframe.

"" The first test well drilled has an overall valuation of $250M+ over a 10 year timespan based on static recent Helium prices.""

The valuation of this well doesn't seem totally unreasonable.  However, they have tested a second well which seems to have production potential of around 3% of the first one. I question if it's even economically viable for production at that point. If it is it certainly would not have near the valuation of the first. So the question is will future wells be more like the first or the second? If the first is more an exception than the rule I'm not sure this makes a lot of sense as an investment. If there is the potential for many wells like that I imagine it will take off sooner or later.

The company does not currently have any revenue and does not have sufficient money to do as they plan. Their continued existence depends on being able to raise more money from someone.  This is both my opinion and the opinion of their auditors.

Then just to put some of the hyperbole in context:

"" Demand has exceeded supply for years, and prices have continued to balloon "" Helium demand did not exceed supply last year, largely due to decreased use during the pandemic. 

"" Good financials (see below) and solid plan that is progressing - tens of thousands of acres procured for drilling and refining. "" Terming this companies financials as ""good"" is uh... a stretch. They raised some money (not enough to execute their plan) and they don't spend much because they aren't doing much.

"" Test wells have shown tremendous yields, with the first test well showing 7% He and 24,000+ mcf (thousand cubic feet) gas flow per day."" Test well (singular) has shown this. As mentioned previously the second well is much much worse, mostly in terms of flow rate, but the helium percentage is a bit over half as much as well.

"" Initial production and revenue generation starts this year. Getting 6 wells running by the end of year will cost $45M total over the lifetime of the wells, while the wells will generate this value in 18 months or less. ""  This seems to assume all wells are as good as the first and not as bad as the second. 

Finally, you use analysis from the cormark report here: [https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom\_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom](https://dashboard.cormark.com/servlet/display.pdf?repid=mmueller%40cormark%2Ecom_20201026113550930&userid=don%40desertmountainenergy%2Ecom)"" but gave a $20+ price target while ignoring their $4.25 price target.  If you're going to use their info you should probably also at least mention their price target.

I am by no means trying to convince people to stay away from this one. I just am presenting the other side for you.  You should be aware you're paying 128 million for 13 million, a plan, some leases and a few holes in the ground at least one of which seems to produce a significant amount of helium. That's pretty much how most companies start, but people should be aware this is still really early stages and a lot could still go wrong.",

mfdia0,,investing,post,1616976808,"Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

UPDATE: It's done, just need all the transactions to go through tomorrow.  Thanks for the tips and advice.",

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

metref,,investing,post,1616902891,"[$BB] The size of the real-world driving datasets that Blackberry IVY has access to will be so much bigger than Tesla'sA huge reason for Tesla's insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of real-world Autopilot data (by comparison, Waymo only has 20 million real-world miles and 10 billion simulation miles). This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train vision-based self-driving system in the real world at such a huge scale. Essentially, Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its self-driving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn.

Blackberry IVY will very soon change the game. By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNX-powered vehicles (and possibly more since IVY is OS-agnostic and will support other non-QNX vehicles), Blackberry IVY will likely become the de-facto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data (camera, radar, lidar, steering wheel rotation, brakes, acceleration etc.) with Autonomous Vehicle software makers (Waymo, Cruise, Argo, Motional, Aurora, TuSimple, Baidu, Pony.AI, Momenta etc.).

By 'sharing', I mean monetizing. De-identified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term. Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards, interface and data marketplaces.

Just imagine this, Tesla only has **<2 million** vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and world-leading ""self-driving car"" company (debatable, I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS, not self-driving). 

Imagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from **>175 million** vehicles. Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software, as well as validate their systems in real-world scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla. This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world.
 
With the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers' lunches, Blackberry IVY will likely create Fear-Of-Missing-Outs (FOMOs) among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a must-have enterprise software. The industry's transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete. Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future (especially cloud-connected vehicle data-driven products that improves battery performance, ride quality, infotainment, autonomous driving). Any forward-looking automaker (both ICE and EV) should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla. Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step.

IVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota, BMW, VW to further enhance their cloud-based enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc. Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest regarding data ownership (unlike Google).","['ICE', 'DE', 'TSLA']"

&#x200B;

**Factual Summary:**

&#x200B;

Coursera (ticker: COUR) is an online learning platform (it is available for perusal at [coursera.org](https://coursera.org) for the curious) . It has been in the industry for over a decade, having been founded by Stanford alums and professors  Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, as an alternative to the more traditional analogue schooling system; it is considered a powerhouse in its field. During this time it has been privately traded at a consistent annual loss despite market popularity. However, it has nearly 80 million users worldwide and is highly rated in the industry. I strongly suspect this fact is itself a main driver in the decision for the company to go public.

&#x200B;

The date of Coursera's IPO onto the NYSE is March 31st, 2021--this coming Wednesday. A definitive price point for shares will not be announced until the day before the company enters the market, but analysts and those snottily claiming to be ""in the know"" speculate a range of $29-$36 per share. At inception, there will be approximately 16 million shares available for trading. Roughly calculated, that is a market volume total of almost $500,000,000. This relegates them to the small-cap investment level. Currently I have been able to locate only one investment fund with holdings in Coursera, SuRo Capital, which invests strictly in privately held companies (you may view the rest of their portfolio at [surocap.com/portfolio](https://surocap.com/portfolio)). At this point in time, Coursera is this fund's largest holding.

**Analysis:**

&#x200B;

From what I have been able to ascertain, Coursera is a ripe pick for the speculative short-term trader, and possibly even for the investor looking for a long-term hold. The stock itself has proven to be volatile, but not uncomfortably so. The fact that management is pushing for an IPO is, to me, indicative of a desire to move from the small-cap investment level into the larger arena. At this point in time, Coursera would be one of the only online learning platforms to make this move--a market indicator for the future perhaps? (Insight: Already one of Coursera's main competitors, Udemy, has announced its intention to IPO later this year, likely so that it can observe the relative success or failure of its industry sibling and rival to gain insights.)

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that Coursera's price point will move with high velocity in the opening days. It is not beyond the realm of believability that it should double on its first day of trading. This point in time to me represents a Goldilocks zone--not too hot, not too cold, but just right. Especially considering the fact that SuRo Capital does not traditionally hold stock for very long in publicly traded companies--as Coursera comprises roughly 17% of SuRo's current portfolio, this is a relevant observation--the opportunity for substantial profits at IPO may not be replicated again for some time, allowing for a palatable purchase price for those wanting a long-term hold just as much as those seeking a short-term profit.",

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

relates to Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One
Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.","['BAC', 'WAT', 'ED', 'ES', 'GS', 'SPGI']"

mei0vc,,investing,post,1616865034,"Plugging In: The EV Transition Gains SpeedArticle from Bloomberg

 What You Need To Know

Tracking the global transition to electrification.

By The Numbers

* 3.1 MillionTotal Global EV Sales in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* $137Average price, per kilowatt hours, for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2020 (Source: BloombergNEF)
* 112,000Public EV charging points installed in China, in December 2020; the monthly figure is more than the size of the entire U.S. public charging network (Source: BloombergNEF)

Why it Matters

At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, automakers’ electric ambitions seemed at risk. But the global auto industry is pushing ahead, driven by carbon emissions targets and climate change policies globally. Combined with the industry’s technological advances, those EV ambitions now are within close reach.

Bloomberg’s coverage of this transition is focused primarily on: cutting-edge technology (improving battery manufacturing processes as one example); cost competitiveness; performance (range, and an adequate charging infrastructure); and regulatory mandates.

There are now more than 10 million electric vehicles on the road globally — a small share of total sales, but a quickly growing one. As BloombergNEF’s analysts have underscored, and reporters from [Bloomberg Green](https://www.bloomberg.com/green?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) / [Hyperdrive](https://www.bloomberg.com/hyperdrive?srnd=storythread-QQ0U1BDWRGG501) have documented, there’s no turning back — the transition to electric road transport is inevitable.",

meu01j,,investing,post,1616903849,"Bonds vs Stocks and Short Term Returns: Now is not the Time to PanicRobert Shiller has discovered a backward looking metric, which he calls Excess CAPE Yield (ECY), that shows a correlation with future returns. He discusses it in a blog post ([https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/making-sense-of-soaring-stock-prices-by-robert-j-shiller-et-al-2020-11)), but doesn't go into that much detail.  He does share the underlying data on-line.

Essentially, ECY measures how desirable stocks are compared to bonds, in terms of expected yields. Larger numbers are better for stocks, and ECY, as of March 2021, is 3.02%. I set out to determine if 3.02% is a ""good"" number or not.

More specifically, ECY = 1/CAPE - (GS10 - inflation)

CAPE = Cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio = S&P real price / (average real earnings from last ten years)

GS10 is the ten year US treasury yield.

Inflation is measured over the last ten years.

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126BtxbKgmsIQrTPLMqQ0bZmkDU7unx1s3q9O2AzgBU4/edit?usp=sharing) \-> Charts. The first figure shows ECY on the x-axis, and subsequent 10 year annualized excess return on the y-axis. Visually, there is a correlation that starts about 1915. The next two plots show the correlation more explicitly, first for 1881 - 2011, and then for 1915 - 2011. The second plot is cleaner.

I then did some back testing and experimenting, which is in the Data tab of the google doc. I found the highest return with the rule that stocks are more desirable if ECY from 3 months ago > 2.0%.

If I move a maximum of 1/12th of my portfolio each month (turning over the whole portfolio in a year) I get an annualized return of 8.73% from 1915 to 2021, compared to 6.78% for stocks alone.

**Conclusions**

* In January, ECY was 3.77%, which is significantly greater than 2.0% so now is not the time to switch to bonds.
* It is rare to get a signal to switch to bonds, and the signal takes a long time to solidify, but that signal should not be ignored.

**Warnings**

* Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All back testing requires diligence about when and how past rules may break down in the future.
* I don't take into account taxes or other transaction costs.
* I used 10-year treasuries and the S&P 500 as my benchmarks because they are both available all the way back to 1871, not because I think they are optimal investments.","['GOOGL', 'SPGI']"

me7ymc,,investing,post,1616824950,"Ending China Stimulus / SEC Law Enacted Provide Unique Buying Opportunity For Chinese Companies (High Risk, High Reward)With the Chinese Central Bank ending stimulus and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act going into effect we have seen a mass selloff of Chinese securities as of late. This selloff has affected almost all Chinese companies only sparing a few that are involved in NFT and Bitcoin plays. This week alone $BIDU is down 22%, $BABA is down 6%, TIGR is down 22%, and FUTU is down 16%. These companies have shown strong growth and some even had amazing Q4 for 2020 during a pandemic (FUTU had a 281.6% increase of total revenue YoY for Q4). Below I am going to explain the two main reasons I see this sell off happening and why I believe it gives a unique buying opportunity.

**· China Central Bank And Government Ending Pandemic Stimulus, Tighter Liquidity Market (1)(2)**

With China being the first major country to come out the other end of the pandemic the China Central Bank and government announced they will be ending the stimulus stance taken during the pandemic to prop up the economy. China is the first major country to emerge on the other side of the pandemic and has returned to normal even in places like Wuhan. With this returning to normal the china central bank has stopped stimulus measures as the worry of inflation creeps in causing stocks of Chinese companies to sink due to more restrictions on flow of money. Additionally, china has continued to crack down on credit use and ease lending worrying about high default rates and companies being over leveraged. This is one of the many reasons ANT was blocked (as well as internal country politics). While many would see this as a sign to be worried it is in fact quite the opposite. China is now positioned to grow rapidly while the rest of the world continues to be weigh down by Covid all the while doing its best to control inflation and risky lending ensuring a bright future for the Chinese economy. No longer having a need for stimulus is a bullish sign not a bearish and should be celebrated.

**· Risk Of Mass Chinese Delisting, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (3)(4)**

On Wednesday March 24th the SEC moved to enact the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which requires foreign companies to allow regulators to review financial audits of overseas companies as well as requires companies to submit documents to prove they are not owned by a government entity and list any board members who are government officials. Anyone who has dabbled in foreign companies will know that the vast majority report unaudited results. Doing so going forward could mean ejection from the NYSE or Nasdaq. China itself restricts what information companies can provide to foreign auditors so even if a company wanted to abide by this new rule it may be difficult. Additionally, the Chinese government is heavily involved in many of the major corporations that operate within China. This spells potential doom for a fast majority of Chinese companies currently listed. To be clear I am 100% for financials being audited and I would love for this to be a thing. I think the fear of government influence in companies is overblown and the US itself heavily plays with the scales of companies that operate in the US, think the bail outs as well as tax breaks for major manufacturers (Boeing). I see all of this as sabre rattling by both sides and since this is a Trump law it is unlikely to continue as is without some tweaks under the Biden admin. It is very unlikely that the us government is just going to mass delist so many companies wiping out trillions in us dollars (big banks invest in these companies!) as the firesale happens before they are ejected from the exchanges. A likely compromise will be reached quietly and both sides will claim victory.

**TLDR:** Chinese dual listed and ADR stocks are taking a beating due to a new us law, Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, as well as China central bank and government ending pandemic stimulus. This has created a unique opportunity where many Chinese companies, ones with healthy books and set for expansion, are selling off. I believe the fear around US mass delisting Chinese companies is overblown and that the Chinese economy is set to continue its expansion in the coming years and that the end of stimulus was due. I see this as a great buying opportunity to get on great companies well below price. This sell off may continue for a few weeks but will come to a halt once the SEC law is changed / rescinded and good economic numbers come out of China. In the coming weeks I will be looking to expand my current holdings in TIGR, FINV, QD, and open new positions in FUTU, CLPS, BABA. Remember: “Be greedy when others are fearful” - Warren Buffett.

mea4sx,gshjot9,investing,comment,1616869480,"I just bought my first shares! I would appreciate it if someone could listen to my reasoning and give me some feedback.

I decided to purchase a few shares from Avantium (AVTX). 

This company is a spinoff from Shell, and their goal is to develop efficient green industrial processes to transform raw carbohydrates from “waste” sources such as wood chips into useful chemical compounds. This is a local company and I visited one of their buildings about two years ago during a university trip, and I saw that their building is modern and well-equipped. Some research groups from my university work with them and I am aware of the work that they are doing. So I have some level of understanding of the technologies that they are developing, and I can see first-hand that the investment that they put into R&D is not being wasted. 

Their current market cap is 138 million euros.  I think that this makes it a very cheap stock, and I expect to see considerable growth. My reasoning is the following:

The company is planning to build the first commercial FDCA plant. FDCA is a sugar-derived compound that can be polimerized into a bioplastic, most notable PEF, which is a leading candidate to replace PET plastics. The industrial process relies mainly on green cyclic catalytic processes. European legislation against standard plastics and in favor of green chemical processes will incentivize companies to use FDCA in the coming years.

At the moment the construction of the FDCA is still uncertain, as they have conditionally secured only 95 of the 150 million euros of funding that they need. This represents a risk, and I think that this is part of what is keeping the share value so low. I think that it is very likely that the company will secure the funding later this year, and this should cause the stock price to increase due to the lowered risk.  
I have tried to get an idea of how much this company could be worth in a few years. I think that AkzoNobel is a nice reference, as it is dutch company that develops paints and coatings and was founded in 1994. Its market cap is 18 billion euros. I also looked at companies that produce PET, and chose Eastman Chemical Company as a reference - its market cap is 15 billion.   
I think that I am not being too optimistic when I say that the market cap of Avantium could be above 2 billion euros 10 years from now. Since the current cap is 138 million, this means that on average an investment on this company would result in an average return on investment of 40% over the next 10 years.   
Putting it in these terms and looking at that 40% yearly ROI figure makes me think that I may be being far too optimistic about the growth of the company. What should I do to come up with more reasonable predictions? Am I thinking too far ahead?   
If you read this far, thanks a lot! Any feedback would be very welcome.",['EMN']

Online finance start-up SoFi is lowering the barrier for amateur investors to buy shares of companies as they go public.

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street's institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don't have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

""Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn't have before,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. ""It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.""

SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It's common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don't typically offer them to the everyday investor.

Noto worked on more than 50 IPOs, including Twitter's debut, in his former role as partner and head of the technology media and telecom group at Goldman Sachs. Firms like Goldman generate revenue from Wall Street funds, which often choose to get in on an IPO ""based on the access they get to that unique product,"" he said.

""Individual investors don't generate those types of revenues, therefore they don't get access to the unique product,"" Noto said. ""The cost of serving retail, if they did decide to do that, would be too high.""

SoFi clients who have at least $3,000 in account value will be able enter the amount of shares they want as a ""reservation."" The app will alert them when it's time to confirm an order.",['TWTR']

me5yvd,,investing,post,1616816797,"Canadian Index ETFs XIU - XIC - VCN - ZCN comparison 

 In this post, we will go over the Best Canadian Index ETFs. I selected only highly popular ETFs with a minimum asset under management of 3 Billion dollars. First things first, we will go over some definition and the pro and cons of holding index ETFs. 

### What’s an Index ETF

There are several types of ETFs. And, index ETFs are the king of the hill. In fact, the first ever ETF introduced to a North American Exchange was an index ETF. Index ETFs offer exposure to a large number of securities and sometimes to a whole stock exchange at a very low cost. Their main goal is to acquire, on your behalf, all the securities that constitute a specific index in order to achieve the same return of the tracked index minus the fees.

### Does Index funds pay dividend?

Yes they do. Since Index ETFs holds all shares of companies part of the index, if these companies pay dividends then a dividend will be distributed. See below the performance table, the dividend yield is included.

 

### Popular indexes

#### S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index)

includes over 200 top-ranked Canadian stocks, representing approximately 95% of the Canadian equity market. Constituent securities must pass minimum float-adjusted and liquidity screens to qualify and maintain membership in the Index. Index weights are capped at 10% of the Index’s float-adjusted market capitalization and are reviewed quarterly.

#### S&P/TSX 60

An index constituted of the 60 largest companies in the Toronto Stock Exchange

#### FTSE Canada All Cap

The FTSE Canada All Cap Domestic Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index representing the performance of Canadian large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies. As of Feb 28th, this index had 178 member stocks.

### Pro and cons of index investing?

**Pros:**

\-Low MER: Because Index ETFs are a passive style of investment, they do not require an active manager. This is why the cost to operate an Index ETF is cheaper than say an Actively managed ETF. Low MER means you will benefit more from the returns the funds makes;

\-Investing in a index fund has proven to be a great strategy in the long term (if you have more than 5 years horizon).

**Cons:**

\-Index ETFs are volatile since they are tied directly to the performance of a stock exchange. Exchanges tend to rally quickly on a glimpse of good economic news but also fall sharply when investors are pessimistic about the near term. This is why it’s important when you buy an index ETF to keep it for the long run and not short term.

\-Some investors prefer to have control over their investments and cherry pick stocks. Obviously, this is not possible under an index fund which basically holds all stocks part of the index without any pre-selection process.

 

### ETFs selected for the analysis

Now that we are done with the definitions, below are the Best Canadian Index ETFs list. We will focus in our comparison on the largest ETFs in Canada in terms of the Asset Under Management.

 ETF                                                          AUM in Millions

 The long term performance for XIU, XIC, ZCN is similar (around 10.35%). VCN is bit lower than the rest at 10.05%.

#  Comparison volatility

Beta

 Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index – **XIU**                             0.91 

 Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp – **XIC**           0.98 

 BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp – **ZCN**                      0.98 

 Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – **VCN**                  0.99 

 Beta is a measure of risk in comparison to the market. The higher the Beta the higher the volatility 

 XIU has the lowest volatility among our 4 contenders. This is probably due the fact that its’ holdings are exclusively large Canadian companies. Large companies tend to be more stable than the overall market. The other ETFs have a beta of 1 which is not surprising since they track a more global market index. 

#  Ishares S&P TSX 60 Index (XIU.TO)

iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF as its’ name implies, it’s a fund that is constituted with the 60 largest companies that are members of the TSX. It’s the most popular ETF in Canada with 10 Billion dollars in Assets. This ETF is representative of the Canadian economy which is dominated by the Energy and Financial sector as you can see below n the sector allocation table.

The number of holdings for the ETF is 60. It has the highest MER in the list but this did not really impact its long term performance in comparison with the other funds. For the 1 year performance, XIU recorded a slightly lower performance than the other ETFs.

# Ishares Core S&P TSX Capped Comp (XIC.TO)

Seeks long-term capital growth by replicating the performance of the S&P®/TSX® Capped Composite Index, net of expenses. While XIU has 60 holdings in total, XIC is much larger with 219 Canadian companies. In terms of performance both XIU and XIC are quite close. XIC has a lower MER 0.06% in comparison to XIU at 0.15%. XIC is dominated by Energy and Financial companies which is the same case for XIU.

#  BMO S&P TSX Capped Comp (ZCN.TO)

ZCN is the third contender in this list of Best Index ETFs in Canada. The BMO S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF (ZCN) has been designed to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index (Index), net of expenses. Both ZCN and XIC are quite similar. They both track the S&P/TSX Capped Composite index. XIC has a lower MER.

#  Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap – VCN

Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF seeks to track the performance of a broad Canadian equity index that measures the investment return of large-, mid- and small-capitalization, publicly traded securities in the Canadian market.

OptimizeRx  operates as a digital health company that provides communications  solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its  products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual  patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample  vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR  and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support  messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads,  therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also  offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working  with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and  implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration,  sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting  their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health  Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for  enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and  HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows  pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage  with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company  offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information,  lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms,  and surveys.

The most compelling  part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean  with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or  JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes  a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the  actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with  new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and  developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to  really cash in on this.

So  traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the  hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products.  They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice  lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this  with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their  respective company to engage.

Well  this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform,  which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals,  doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.

""When  a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as  soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an  ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or  to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a  new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the  physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can  put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I  always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is  B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc.,  to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care  in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices  and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold  (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The  overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic  but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While  it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog  to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain  laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want  to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard  facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way,  businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves  money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch  presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With  the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves  time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR.  Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX  has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small  cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of  18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even  higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M.

So  what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially  lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with  posting positive operating income.

OPRX  didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal  of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they  will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call  transcript:

*Analyst:  ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a  year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've  got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into  that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type   revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve  that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William  Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date  on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get   there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should   scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep  talking about""*

He also said: *""  In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin  recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth  has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4)  they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The  platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient,  further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The  reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is  because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on  different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C),  OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies,  medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc  (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation.

So  TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue  on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One  could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC  grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2)  business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more  recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to  digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while  humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the  doctor in person.

(3)  outlook  -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which  would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up  only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So  I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their  fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly  when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies  promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was  kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head  of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales  agent.

The business shifted into  the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial  booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I  know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500%  yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now  especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock  which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high  growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to  profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total  addressable market.

It recently  pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the  high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above  that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday.  And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a  financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of  medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not  integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX  does.

I like this, I think it's a really good idea; and dealing directly with sales staff means they will pay. Companies don't always pay for quality, but they do pay for sales.

&#x200B;

Whats their addressable market? say it takes off & becomes a staple; how much will insurance companies pay them?

My concern is Insurance companies are shitty, shitty business partners to have; when you do business with a monopoly expect to get fleeced. How hard would it be for Insurance companies to replace them with their own software development teams; realistically how much can OPRX charge before they do so?

&#x200B;

In Buffets terms; companies need a 'moat'. Nobody is going to pay OPRX **unless they have to.** How can OPRX force its customers to pay?

So my dad bought shares of Indusind international holdings (the holding company of Indusbank) in the 90s for 1 USD per share and they are based in the Mauritius. The company is offering to buyback the shares for 5 USD per share. 

From what I understand the company isn’t publicly listed so I would have to find a buyer myself but according to [this](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/indusind-bank-s-promoter-plans-to-get-listed-overseas-11613609396633.html) article they plan to become listed overseas by the 1st week of September. Does it mean it would be on a publicly listed stock exchange such as the NYSE? I think the market value of each share is a lot higher than the 5USD per share that the company is offering to buy back for, so would it make sense to wait for them to become publicly listed?

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.","['SPGI', 'WFC', 'BLK']"

mcpqqp,,investing,post,1616645951,"The SEC confirms it is investigating SoftBank for market manipulation. Softbank spent $17B worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4B in bets to prop up their prices.
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/softbank-says-unaware-of-sec-probe-into-securities-trading

On Wednesday, short seller research site PlainSite posted a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter revealing that the agency is investigating SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company and investing giant notorious for financing various unprofitable “technology” companies like WeWork, Uber, Compass, and Oyo.

Aaron Greenspan, founder of the Think Computer Foundation that runs Plainsite, filed a FOIA request in December 2020 for ""any investigative materials [from January 1, 2018 to the present] pertaining to the various SoftBank companies controlled by Masayoshi Son, specifically relating to SoftBank's trading of stocks and derivatives on those stocks.""

This request was filed in response to the revelation last fall that SoftBank was the ""Nasdaq whale.” SoftBank was responsible for stoking a huge rally in tech stocks, the Financial Times reported, because around August it began buying billions of dollars worth of call options in a shift for the company, fueling a rally that pushed up the share prices of tech companies it held billions of dollars of equity in.

Thanks in large part to a rally sparked by SoftBank’s high-risk market plays, firms like Tesla and Apple were up 74 and 21 percent, respectively, in the month of August alone. Executed through a small desk of traders and chief executive Masayoshi Son himself, the trading unit―named SB Northstar―and its bets won the company some $4 billion in gains at the beginning of September, before quickly melting away into nearly $3 billion in losses by the end of the month.

In a January letter responding to Greenspan’s initial request, and months after the reporting on Softbank became public, the SEC said that its search did not turn up any relevant records. Greenspan appealed the decision on March 9 and two weeks later received a letter saying that responsive records were identified, but they could not be released under legal provisions that cover ongoing investigations.

“We have confirmed with Division of Enforcement staff that the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing,” the SEC letter stated.

According to the letter, the SEC maintains that releasing the records “could cause harm to the active and ongoing enforcement proceedings because, among other things, individuals and entities of interest in the underlying investigation could fabricate evidence, influence witness testimony and/or destroy or alter certain documents,” in addition to revealing cooperating witnesses and the general scope of the investigation.

The debatable merits of the SEC’s denial aside, an investigation into Softbank may indicate that its risky trading strategy is catching up to the giant. SoftBank unwound its Nasdaq derivative positions by December 2020 after investors questioned its ""controversial strategy"" which could've lost the company billions more. The last look at SB Northstar's books at the end of September showed that it had bought about $17 billion worth of shares in the US tech market, with another $3.4 billion in bets to prop up their prices.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.","['TSLA', 'TWTR', 'NDAQ', 'AAPL']"

mcfag2,,investing,post,1616616477,"Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

>The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;

Cumulative rights will not guarentee a payment as this seems to imply. before the company issues their next dividends they are required to first pay the cummulative before the common share holders.  

>The preferred share price tend to rise if the price of the regular share rises or lose value if the opposite scenario occurs;

No. There is a reason every preferred share you see is in the 24-27 dollar range regardless of the performance of the underlying. 

>Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products.

Thats a bingo and and answer to your comment above.

Nope. These are what are called ""callable"" shares. there are non-callable shares, they will pay a lower coupon.

mcqwym,,investing,post,1616650283,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF) Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

Richard Handler, their CEO, strikes me as a likeable and down to earth person who I can trust with my money. I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"". He readily takes on the 'boomer' title in his stride, acknowledges the power of momentum trading (which has been unbelievable in post-covid 2020), but still has the fortitude to assert his own stance about the eventual return of stocks towards their fundamental valuations (which we have seen play out over the past weeks).

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.",

-	Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

-	The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

-	The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

“Intel is and will remain a leading developer of process technology, a major manufacturer of semiconductors, and the leading provider of silicon globally,” Gelsinger said.

Intel also said that it will act as a “foundry,” or a manufacturing partner, for other chip companies that focus on semiconductor design but need a company to actually make the chips. Intel said its foundry subsidiary will be called Intel Foundry Services and will be led by Randhir Thakur, a current Intel senior vice president.

Gelsinger said the foundry business will compete in a market potentially worth $100 billion by 2025 and will manufacture a range of chips, including chips based on ARM technology, which are used in mobile devices, and has historically competed with Intel’s favored x86 technology.

A slide displayed by Intel suggested that companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm could be customers for the business. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appeared at Gelsinger’s talk in a show of support for Intel’s move.","['AMZN', 'INTC', 'QCOM', 'MSFT']"

mc095v,,investing,post,1616572099,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolutionThe Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining
* Crypto (I have no experience in this besides some small positions in BTC and ETH, feel free to drop any DD and knowledge)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But Amazon and Microsoft are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably.

mbu9i0,,investing,post,1616549438,"It appears the recent move in the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.2% to 1.7% had very little to do with inflation expectations.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/04/business/financial-markets/bonds-stock-japanese-economy-global-economy-u-s-treasuries/   
[March 4]    
>Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
>
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
>....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
>
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
> 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
> 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",['MS']

mbjmdg,,investing,post,1616519710,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mineHi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay. As far as I'm concerned, Office Commercial has a mile-long moat with crocodiles in it.","['NFLX', 'AMZN', 'IP', 'GOOGL', 'GS', 'CRM', 'NI', 'AAPL', 'FB', 'MSFT']"

mbfyx6,,investing,post,1616509824,"CRSR DD - A Compelling Growth Story**About Corsair Gaming**

Corsair Gaming manufactures a variety of gaming/streaming related goods. This includes tower cases, keyboards, headsets, audio equipment, and entirely pre-built PCs. Therefore, their primary sources of revenue are derived from manufacturing hardware (rather than software).

&#x200B;

**Thesis**

Given the expected growth of gaming, esports, and streaming, Corsair at its current valuation (roughly $3bn) is undervalued. I will attempt to justify this through environmental, financial, and strategical analysis. Then I will assess potential risks/threats to Corsair moving forward.

&#x200B;

**Overview**

In the environmental analysis I will focus on Corsair's competitive environment. Specifically, I will review what I believe are Corsair's main competitive advantages.

In the financial analysis I will examine historical statements, as well as address projections. I will describe why I am confident in Corsair's valuation and financial health.

Through strategic analysis I will further illustrate Corsair's competitive advantage, and how management can execute that. Particularly, I believe Corsair's acquisition strategy offers a compelling growth story.

Finally, I will cover common criticisms and potential vulnerabilities to Corsair's strategy/growth.

&#x200B;

**Environmental**

The market for gaming components and peripherals is naturally not free of competition. Logitech, Razor, and a number of other brands offer budget and high-end components and peripherals.

I believe, however, that Corsair has and will continue to establish consumer loyalty. Corsair (in a dated article) was among top brand loyalty for peripheral gaming brands.^(1) I was unable to find more recent information, but I believe this is indicative of Corsair being one of the most desired brands in the market. However, Corsair and other manufacturers still face pressure on things such as price point and consumer reviews, and can't rely wholly on reputation or brand name.

The Elgato division is also incredibly successful in the creator/competitive gaming peripherals market. Elgato's range of products, like Corsair, are seen as the premium within its market. The gamer and creator segment is Corsair's fastest growing, boasting a 104% YoY revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the excellent reviews on Elgato's streaming hardware, I'm confident the streaming segment will continue to see growth.^(2)

The CAGR for esports through 2026 is expected to be 20%.^(3) Given Corsair's correlation to the esports industry, this inspires confidence in growth outlooks.

It is my belief that Corsair is well positioned within a very hot market that will continue to see growth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Financial**

Corsair has seen significant and consistent revenue growth. Last year, revenue was $1.7bn, meaning the trailing price to revenue ratio is roughly 1.8, pretty reasonable for a growing company. Income was $103m, meaning the trailing price to earnings ratio is roughly 29, also reasonable given its growth prospects.^(4)

Expectations for 2021 are $1.9bn in revenue, and income of $128m. This implies a forward revenue ratio of roughly 1.6, and a forward price to earnings ratio of roughly 23.^(5)

In the current climate of tech, these ratios seem reasonable. Especially when considering the long-term growth outlook for demand in gaming peripherals and creator hardware.

Corsair also has a relatively healthy balance sheet. Over the last several years, Corsair's debt to equity ratio has gotten gradually better, now at roughly 74%. This represents a significant degree of leverage, but it is encouraging to see it decreasing.

Both Corsair's debt and interest coverage ratios are healthy, however. Free cash flow represents 52% of its debt, and their EBIT has 4.6x coverage on interest payments. Its short-term asset to short-term liability ratio is also above 1.^(6)

Given their relatively healthy financial ratios, I think Corsair is primed to take advantage of the explosive growth in esports and gaming.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

Corsair's approach to acquisitions provides a healthy and sustainable growth strategy. Corsair has successfully expanded into a wide variety of components, peripherals, and accessories. They select companies for acquisition that offer a premium brand name and accompany their portfolio well.

The acquisition of SCUF gaming (manufacturer of controllers for both PC and consoles) in December of 2019 is a perfect example of this. It is a well-known brand that is perceived as high quality, and compliments Corsair's existing line of products well. It extends Corsair's reach into gaming without overlapping its existing products.

Integrating these divisions into existing supply chains and outsourcing manufacturing allows Corsair to maximize profitability.^(7)

The general trust of stewardship to continue to make intelligent acquisitions is a key part of Corsair's strategy. Long-term growth is enabled through these acquisitions and expansion into gaming and esports.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Given Corsair is primarily focused on manufacturing of goods, it isn't a true tech company. This means that as it continues to scale, the operating margin will only improve slightly.

Loyalty among consumers could be a concern, as many gamers are concerned solely with specs and don't adhere to any one brand.

Corsair's degree of leverage could prove problematic if esports/gaming slows.

Trust of stewardship is of great importance, given Corsair's emphasis on acquisitions to create growth. If management makes poor choices in acquisition targets, Corsair's profitability and brand name could suffer.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is priced low considering its growth prospects and execution within the esports/gaming industry.

mblhn8,,investing,post,1616524707,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research & Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

mbvs0e,,investing,post,1616554318,"Leveraged ETF - Projected Returns of Funds for Intra-Day Purchases - How does the math work?I'm trying to understand how the table is generated for in the summary prospectus.

This is the [prospectus](http://direxioninvestments.onlineprospectus.net/DirexionInvestments//SPXL/index.html?open=Summary%20Prospectus) I'm looking at. Turn to page 380 for the section I'm trying to understand.

From my understanding it is trying to explain how without rebalancing, you become overexposed if the underlying asset depreciates and underexposed when the asset appreciates.

I thought that the math basically worked as such: In the ideal situation you buy the fund and at that instant your asset is valued at (3/1=) 300% of the underlying index. If the underlying asset drops by 1% then  (3/.99=) 303% but the provided table states an index move of -1% = 306%.  Conversely, if the index appreciates then you become underexposed as such (3/1.01=) 297%, but again the table states it as 294%.  

This seems to point to being off by a factor of two as 3/.98 = 306% and 3/1.02 = 294%. If I am off by the factor of two then I don't fully understand the math behind the calculation. Also the factor of 2 math falls apart with the larger price moves: 3/.9 = 333% (not the provided 335% in the table) and 3/1.1 = 272% (not the provided figure of 274%).

To further complicate things the table for the exposure of a Leveraged Bull Fund and Leveraged Bear Fund are different and I'm not seeing why. 

If someone can explain to me the math in both the Bear and Bull scenarios used to come up with the data in the table I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks for the help.",

mbvs0e,gs1o9xi,investing,comment,1616592794,"~~Can you give the table number? Table 7 on pg 379 of the full prospectus is maybe what you’re looking at?~~

~~Edit: I think you’re talking about example 3 starting on page 375 (written page number on the PDF).~~

Edit2: ok you’re actually talking about Table 3 on pg 377. This is talking about intra-day or “within” day effects. It’s saying if the index has **already** gone up or down by X, what resulting exposure are you buying at for the day? 

E.g. if the underlying has **already** gone up by 1% for the day, you are buying at 294%, not 300%. Say both the underlying and 3x leveraged open at 100. The underlying goes up by 1%, and you buy the 3x leveraged at this point. Since the 3x leveraged also started at 100, you are buying it at 103. OK. 

Now, imagine during the rest of the day, the underlying increases by another 1% from 101 to 102.01. If you were truly buying at 3x leverage you would expect to make 3%, so 103 x 1.03 = 106.09. BUT due to the reduced intraday leverage you make less than that. The close of the underlying will be 100\*1.01\*1.01 = 102.01. The close of the 3x gives you 3x the gain over the *whole* day: 2.01% * 3 = 6.03% gain, so it will close at 106.03. Now compare to what you bought at (103) and you can see you only gained 106.03/103 = 2.94% instead of 3%. That 2.94% is where the 294% leverage number comes from in the table.

This effect is eliminated as soon as you hold for longer than a day, as you effectively buy at open every day that you hold.",['PG']
mbvs0e,gs1qi8s,investing,comment,1616593860,"Honestly I don't understand it. What if you just bought a non-leveraged ETF with leverage. Let's say you are an individual investor and you get cheap margin or take out a loan on your real-estate etc and buy ETFs with that money. Surely this amplifies the return of the underlying and you don't need to worry about rebalancing yourself.

Now say instead of an individual investor, you pool together other investors and buy non-leveraged ETFs.

maqmx6,,investing,post,1616427887,"JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from InstitutionsArticle from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.","['ADI', 'JPM']"

mc8nea,,investing,post,1616599768,"Fluent (FLNT) - Highly volatile + Market Psychology play 

I should point out that *this is my first DD*, and that this **IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, I am simply condensing information that I've found and am using myself. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.**

My DD focuses on financials, with some of the theory I've picked up over the past few weeks of looking into the markets/investing/trading. I'll try to keep it concise;

Fluent (FLNT) focuses on being ""grounded in marketing innovation"" ([Source](https://www.fluentco.com/about-us/)), with their motto being ""Enabling advertisers to identify, win and keep the best customers for their business"". Fluent (FLNT) is partnered with over 500 clients, and according to the information on their website, this includes Fortune 500 brands.

On the 29th of April 2020, Fluent (FLNT) has announced plans to accelerate international expansion in response to increased demand from advertisers.

**Pros;**

\- **RSI is in the oversold territory**, currently sitting at 32.44 at the time of writing this post.

\- **200 SMA** is above the current price, along with the **50SMA** and **20SMA** being above each other, which is suggesting, from my knowledge, a bullish trend.

\- **Current Ratio** (Assets/Liabilities) is **over 1.5** (1.70 to be exact).

\- Current trading volume is at \~275,000, meaning that it is relatively easy to buy and sell, unlike some of the penny stocks, meaning that the market order you place will likely go through at the price you've put it, and you won't have to wait for longer periods of time before your order eventually goes through.

\- The **Beta factor** is sitting at 3.07, meaning that this stock is **highly volatile** compared to the market - If the market goes up by 10%, it would be expected to see the shares of FLNT to go up by \~30%, and vice versa.

\- **Institutional ownership at 30.80%**

\- High **increases in EPS** this year (226%) and projections for next year (50%), along with increased sales over past 5 years (85%).

**Cons;**

\- It has been recently (17.03.2021) **downgraded from 'Outperform' to 'Market Perform'** by Barrington Research, due to the slowdown in the growth for the fourth-quarter. The management claims that their decision ""... to limit its business to higher-quality advertising traffic..."" **may result in being beneficial in the long term** ([Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/why-fluent-stock-was-slammed-on-wednesday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)). Consequently, some of the investors have decided to exit their positions, leading to a drop from \~6.85 to \~5.70, and currently sitting at \~4.40 at the time of writing this post.

**Information worth noting;**

\- Key levels to pay attention to from my understanding; \~4.25, \~6.00, \~7.20.

\- [Market Psychology](https://editorial.azureedge.net/miscelaneous/gvelazquez-20171010-market-cycle-emotion-636432987191782895.jpg), from the DD, I'm thinking that this stock may be at either the **'Panic' stage** or the **'Capitulation' stage**, and taking into consideration that the stock is being oversold, there may be a price jump coming up, as it is closing in on a key support level (\~4.25).

\- Institutional ownership might be a key factor to pay attention to as well, as we all know, **smart money is many steps ahead of us**, and they have the means to move the price with ease with further investments, or by exiting their positions.

Lastly, I'm gonna repeat myself - **Do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do not take responsibility for your decisions, this information is publicly available.**

Also, any constructive criticism on my first DD? Much appreciated.",

They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile/rocket manufacturers.

* According to Bloomberg, the defense budget proposal for next yr is flat compared to this year, or slightly down from last year if compared in real term. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/pentagon-crafting-next-budget-close-to-this-year-s-704-billion) And the budget might be flat for a while because of the ballooning debt.
* LMT is facing serious pressure in reducing the cost of their F35 program. It still has a lot of issues/flaws to address before entering full-rate production. The full rate production approval had been delayed again and again. While I think it's unlikely that the F35 program will be cancelled altogether, the margins will probably be lower than anticipated because of all these cost reduction measure and all the political pressure.

On the bright side:

* if its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne is approved, then that'd be a boost to its space division. However, Raytheon and a few other companies are contesting that acquisition. Many analysts are expecting the deal to go through with some conditions, but if you buy LMT, then you need to be aware of this.
* Another bright point is that LMT's backlog is bigger than its current market cap. So there'd still be plenty of work even with the flat budget.

If the F35 full rate production phase is delayed again, or the acquisition is denied, then be prepared for a drop.

mb3kxg,,investing,post,1616463791,"Interesting facts about brokerage insuranceA lot of us probably remember the GFC and the fallout of large financial institutions going under. With this somewhat traumatic memory in my mind I was curious to know exactly how much of my assets(stocks) that are sitting in my TD Ameritrade account are insured in one way or another. Here's what I found:

1) Cash 'may' be covered by the FDIC up to 250k. The language on this was a little opaque so I'd call them to confirm if I wanted to know for sure. 

2) CDs purchased through TD are covered by the FDIC.

3) Securities are covered by the SIPC up to 500k.

4) TD has a supplemental insurance policy that claims to protect customers up to 149.5 million for securities and 2 million for cash. The big caveat here is the aggregate limit for this policy is a measly 500 million.

This won't be an issue for most people (myself included) but I thought it was interesting to see how the 12 million customers with 1.2 trillion worth of assets at TD are insured in the worst case scenario. It seems like those with over 500k in assets with TD might be exposed given some crazy event that leads to insolvency. 

I don't think insolvency is going to happen, but its worth knowing your exposure.

matlli,,investing,post,1616435520,"iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD) DD - Bullish Case For Continued Lumber Prices & 2021 OutlookHello everyone, I would like to share my thoughts on the lumber market for the next 4-6 months and an ETF that could benefit heavily (WOOD). 

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber & forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets. 

* \[New record highs for wood futures\] ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs))
* The housing market reflects optimism on rates
   * The US Housing Market has been booming despite the high level of unemployment and economic contraction from COVID. However, the pandemic is changing trends in where people are choosing to live (Zoom Towns). As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US & Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.   

&#x200B;

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate. 

Current WOOD Price: \~85/share. 

Price Target by July 2021: \~$110/share.","['HD', 'NDAQ']"

mazs74,,investing,post,1616452225,"Alternative Investments: African Agricultural Crowd Investment Platforms - Experiences?I'm sorry for posting this as its own post, but I'm looking to gather experiences that may be relevant to other investors and if I do it in the daily, there's gonna be up to one answer and then it will disappear in the bowels of reddit forever.

In looking for ways in which to invest in the growing economy of south-saharan Africa, Nigeria in particular (Yes haha, but no royal families were involved in the writing of this post), I came across several crowd investing platforms as possibly the best way to do so, as a westerner with limited funds.

The idea is always similar: Invest (with others) into a specific project where a farmer needs land/equipment/seeds/whatever to get started (or to improve), but can't get a bank loan, then share the profit of the harvest with the farmer (variable ROI depending on harvest, typically around 10% in 6-12 months).

I particularly like the idea of helping someone at the same time as investing and there's definitely an altruistic side to this. Often the projects involve providing jobs to unemployed youth, and/or would significantly improve the future outlooks of the supported farmer(s).

Unfortunately, I can't find much further information on the web about any of these sites, but at least I didn't find any scam accusations while searching for people's experiences. 

My biggest concerns are:

- What if the project (platform) I choose turns out to be an outright scam?

- What if I choose a long term project and the platform goes belly up/bankrupt? (Following some recommended links in an article I found, half of the linked sites didn't exist anymore. Yikes.)

- How will I have any realistic legal recourse if I don't even live on the same continent as the platform owners?

With every investment, there is risk, and I'm inclined to give some of them a shot with a small amount, because I really like the concept a lot. But first, I wanted to see if any of you have any experience with any of the following sites:

- https://ez-farming.com - this one is simultaneously the most appealing to me, and the most concerning because much of the website is broken or unfinished.

others:

- https://kwidex.com/

- https://www.youfarm.africa

- https://www.farmfundr.com - This one is in the US, so more trustworthy, but lacking that altruism factor a bit.

- https://charmimpact.com - Not farming, but bringing CO2 reduction and energy efficient tech to rural areas, helping them save money, so upping profits.

So what do you think? Do you have any positive or negative experience with any of these sites, or do you have more knowledge to share on the subject?",

mazs74,grwmk2d,investing,comment,1616485706,"The fund I worked for invested in another fund that focused on agri investment into Africa and the Caribbean (""Car-Af Agri Fund"" from here on out"").

We invested in 2010, and were initially excited. The fund raised $100M USD, we were a minor partner and met with the fund managers. Many were operators (good thing) and a few were finance guys.  Did some background checks - most of the operators had worked in similar countries before, or performed similar investments on a project basis (one by one) for some of the existing investors in the Car-Af Agri Fund.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 10 years later, the fund liquidated earlier this year (the original time horizon). NAV per share declined 80% of par value (we invested at call it $1.00 per share, worth $0.20 now). That's NAV (based on their internal estimates), realistically, we are only going to get $0.05 to $0.10 per share.

&#x200B;

Lessons:

&#x200B;

* Agri investing is long term in most developed countries (let alone developing), 10 years is not enough in some cases
*  Meeting operators/finance guys are always great, but the key questions we did not ask/aware of at the time included the following:
   * Hiring plan - if you are to create a commercial farm in developing countries, how are you going to hire X/Y people? If neighboring farms are employing 10-20 people, and you create a gigantic commercial farm, you need to hire 50-100 people - at a reasonable market rate - and get them to move away from their families 
   * Who are the LOCAL managers? Operators are great, but the guys we met had run big projects, how are they going to execute if they live in London/South Africa/USA/Lagos with a farm in Ghana? Are they going there every week?
   * How are products going to get from Point A to Point B? What is Point B? Can we process the raw products? Are they ready for export? Are they for domestic consumption? Are we selling to a wholesaler? Are we selling direct to retail? What are our pricing terms to them? Is it annual? 
* A whole host of other shit I can't write atm - but basically, agri is tough enough in developed markets (technical expertise etc) or at least it is for me, let alone in fringe markets.

There are better ways to get exposure to this than rely on the underlying.

There were [take-private talks last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i1f4fc/wsj_reports_kansas_city_southern_usmexico/) valuing KCS at around $208 per share which were rejected, and now CP has apparently swooped in with a deal valued at [about $275/share](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210321005013/en/Canadian-Pacific-and-Kansas-City-Southern-Agree-to-Combine-to-Create-the-First-U.S.-Mexico-Canada-Rail-Network).

Since the STB has shown reluctance to allow any more mergers between the big 6, this is basically the last big rail merger that's realistically possible.

Speaking personally, $KSU was my biggest position (over 20% of my portfolio) and my favorite one too, as a strong bet on the growth of the US-Mexican trade relationship. I'll be looking for other ways to play that thesis and would be interested if anybody else has any ideas. Might sit in $CP while looking over my other options.

E: adding additional info  

[Here is the website that CP and KCS have set up to discuss the new combined company](https://futureforfreight.com/)

There is an investor call happening at 2pm EST today (in 30 minutes) to discuss the merger. You can find a link at [this website](https://investor.cpr.ca/events/)

The deal is for $90 and .489 CP shares per current KSU share, so the final value may fluctuate from the current $275 number.

Major synergies identified on the call: grain and bulk food shipments from Canada down to the Gulf and Mexico (KSU already does major business exporting Midwestern/Great Palins grain along this route), chemicals and plastics moving both ways, additional intermodal routes between Mexico and the upper Midwest/Canada, and automotive shipments from Mexico all the way up","['CSX', 'KSU', 'NSC', 'UNP']"

**Financials:**

The last earnings posted by Bionano was on the 13th of November, 2020. The consensus was ($0.06) and the reported ($0.08). They will report their Q4 financials for 2020 this Tuesday after the market close. The Consensus Estimate is ($0.05) and **in my opinion, there will be a surprise considering 2021 has been a breakthrough year for them.**

&#x200B;

**PUT / CALL Ratio:**

Bionano currently has 0.49 put/call ratio which denotes a bullish sentiment that over the months and years becomes more and more bullish.

**Share Statistics:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/key-statistics?p=BNGO)

&#x200B;

If we focus on the **short ratio** we can be calm that shorts are not betting against this company to fall.

We do see a very low percentage of shares owned by Insiders and Institutions. On the 25th of January, 2021, their CFO Christopher Stewart bought 64,500 shares. Insider buying is generally a positive prognostic and beneficial for the stock's price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, the stock price rises. This might be the start of some Insiders movements in my opinion.

Moving onto Institutional ownership, Vanguard Group Inc., bought over 7.1 million shares at the end of 2020. They are the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.

&#x200B;

**Competitors:**

&#x200B;

The main three competitors are Fulgent Genetics Inc. ($FLGT), Twist Bioscience Corp. ($TWST), and NeoGenomics Inc. ($NEO).

Comparing their prices the lowest is after BNGO is NEO with 50.18 per share, FLGT at 105.96 per share, and TWST sitting at 130.29 per share.

Price aside, let's talk about **Bionano's Saphyr** characteristics that can put them above their competition.

\- Bionano’s Saphyr system is a research use-only platform for ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific structural variation detection that enables researchers and clinicians to accelerate the search for new diagnostics and therapeutic targets and to streamline the study of changes in chromosomes, which is known as cytogenetics.

\- Bionano provides genome analysis services to provide access to data generated by the Saphyr system for researchers who prefer not to adopt the Saphyr system in their labs.

\- A publication of a study by the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) revealing that their sequencing method based on PacBio HiFi reads detected only 72% of the large SVs that Bionano’s optical genome mapping (OGM) detected across 32 different human genomes. The consortium developed its custom sequencing method by combining sequencing with PacBio and the single-strand prep and sequencing method StrandSeq to establish a comprehensive catalog of human SVs with base-pair and haplotype resolution. The cost of this method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. **OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method.**

\- With the latest update to Saphyr’s software released this week, the instrument can now generate clinical quality SV calls on 12 samples per day per instrument and up to 96 samples per week. For cases requiring higher coverage, like mosaic samples or heterogeneous tumors, the run can be extended up to 24 hours to collect as much as 400x coverage of a human genome for each of the three flowcells.

\- Per Erik Holmlin “By contrast, Saphyr images molecules that are consistently **20 to 30 times longer than PacBio reads**. Sequencing reads are not getting longer, which we believe implies that Saphyr will remain the only effective and affordable technology currently capable of detecting the structural rearrangements in the genome that are involved in the disease.”

\- Saphyr Chip Clip protects sample integrity and eliminates the need for instrument wash cycles between runs. Requires less than 3 minutes hands-on instrument time per chip. Automatic optimization of run conditions based on sample characteristics maximizes throughput.

\- The Bionano Prep DLS DNA labeling kit provides all the enzymes, dyes, and buffers you need to label non-amplified DNA for Saphyr. Controls for validating the labeling biochemistry are also provided.

[*https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/*](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/)

\- In a paper published the 10th of November, 2020, in MedRxiv, a consortium of cytogenetic experts led by Dr. Brynn Levy, Professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University and Medical Director of the Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital recommended that optical genome mapping (OGM) using Bionano’s Saphyr System be considered as a first-line test for detection and identification of clinically relevant structural variants and copy number variants in leukemias.

**Keep on Buying Bionano Stock, Says Analyst Following Healthcare Conference.**

Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from ""no-call"" reflex testing in NIPS (noninvasive prenatal screening) later this year and next year for solid tumors.

The company said that via a combination of better hardware capabilities and software updates that lower the amount of consumables required for each run, Bionano can achieve the goal of a $100 per genome cost in the next-gen Saphyr.

All in all, DeGeeter reiterates an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on BNGO shares along with a $15 price target. Investors are expected to pocket a 69% gain if the analyst’s thesis materializes.

**Why Bionano Genomics (BNGO) Might Surprise This Earnings Season.**

Bionano Genomics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BNGO in this report.

The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 5 cents per share for BNGO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for BNGO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.09% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns.

&#x200B;

**TLDR & My plan:**

I´m currently holding 10k shares and don´t plan to increase my position unless I can get some liquidity tomorrow. The stock already reached $15.69 per share and I see this getting to that point again anytime soon. I plan to hold this long trying to sell high and re-buy on the dips, but mid and long-term show great strength.

This is a great company with a great product, a product that is cheaper than its competition´s, with greater results and continuously expanding its detection range.

Hi, I am a very unsuccessful stock investor, in fact I could easily be characterized as a cautionary tale. I am 59 years old and first entered the market in my 20s less than a year prior to the 1987 crash. Invested $10k, lost $9K.

I next entered the market again in 1999 and the .com debacle turned my $15K into about $1K again. Now I am not intellectually incapacitated, I have a degree in Electrical Engineering graduating with honors. I am not saying this makes me smart....just that I have the capacity to understand technical concepts.

Let me also say that I have done well as a Real Estate investor and essentially ""retired"" at 38 with a ""semi passive"" income stream from rental properties I own, both residential and commercial. I still go into my office, but have the option to do what I want for weeks on end, depending on the current status of my rentals.

Now having entered the market twice and taking a beating both times I swore off the stock market. I frankly did not think about the market all that much.

So fast forward to the next big crash, the 2008 sub-prime. When this occurs a light bulb goes off in my head...yes I realize how incredibly obvious this should have been, but what can I say, I really was not thinking about it much. I realized that I had bought into the top of 2 big bull markets because everyone was talking about the stock market is killing it, this is the way to make money. This time I saw the same thing but stayed out of it.

This is my chance to get it right. I am going to buy when there is blood in the street now. Look for the right time and buy everything at a discount, I am not the sucker this time. So when the market was picking up late 2009 and through 2010, I invested $80K (I am older and have more money by this time).

I have an Uncle who has done well in the stock markets over the years and I let him school me a little, looking up companies on Valueline and picking based on what should be ""value stocks"". I bought oil based stocks, telco, pharma and silver mines. I thought now that I bought at the right time, I can just sit back and let them go.

Strike three, I turned my $80k into $50K in under a decade by letting my dozen stocks deteriorate and in a few cases go bankrupt. So next expensive lesson learned, you can't just let stocks go unwatched for years. I saw them go down and thought, well I am NOT going to sell at a loss...just wait it out. Frontier Communications is my single biggest failure, bankrupt along with Seadrill. On the bright side I have plenty of tax deductions saved up.

The vast majority of my net worth is Real Estate equity. In fact all the stocks I have purchased in my lifetime are a very small percentage of my holdings. But as I see retirement coming up before too long, I will eventually be selling some property and will need to invest somewhere, even if it is more bonds than anything. This is my current motivation to really learn the market and avoid the terrible mistakes I have made.

Now to the present. I play a lot of golf, and two of my golf buddies are well versed in the markets, one of them went full time and now stays home as a ""swing trader"" when Covid killed his job. He was a Merrill lynch broker and financial advisor years ago. The two of them have taught me much, and/or showed me various resources to study and learn about the market.

I have spent the last 3 months studying the market. I even made a quick grand on Gamestop (which I completely realize was gambling). But watching the group mentality I thought it was safe that the next dip was Going to bounce back a good 20%, instead it made me 280%. This was the bounce back from the day AFTER the huge Feb 24th jump.

So with some of my studying I am slowly divesting myself of the poorly rated stocks I have. Some have doubled in value since 2010, and a few are worthless (Seadrill and Frontier), most are down 25% to 75% . I am selling covered calls to get a tiny bit of income until it rises enough to finally get sold....perhaps I will lower the strike prices slowly to insure I do get rid of them before too long. I never traded an option before this year. I subscribed to Investors Business Daily and am also checking Tip ranks, and Valueline to see the health of what stocks I have left. I am slowly liquidating them all to start over with some active analysis this time. I plan to put the majority of it into SPY, a little less in QQQ, and still less in a Russel 2000 ETF. Then maybe play actively with a little portion of what I have, honestly for fun and education primarily...like a few hundred dollars here and there.

Now with regard to putting my $50K into much safer stuff (like SPY), I am now looking at an 11 year bull run, unless you count the Covid crash...but that was not really a market correction so much as a worldwide shutdown, something I have never seen...AND the markets all came back fully pretty quickly after that. So I find myself hesitant to even put it all in safer ETF's right now as I feel like I am standing in the same place I was in the 1986 and 1999.

I know this is a long post and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I don't really have a specific question, I would just like to hear any feedback (besides, your an idiot, and don't ever buy stocks again), advice, even similar stories.",

ma29dn,,investing,post,1616349889,"Personal investor ""Valuation"" vs. Index fundsI'm an amateur investor about 2 years into investing and learning and reading as much as I can. So far I've read A Walk Down Wallstreet and a couple other similar books that have convinced me that, outside of changing careers and committing my life to understanding investment finance, the best I can do is a broad market index fund. I'm ***not*** a day trader -- I am a buy-and-hold for decades type, probably best described as a Boglehead in my strategy, and I'm content with that ... mostly. 

I often read people commenting ""X is undervalued"" or ""Y is overvalued"" and this drives their decision making in picking stocks. From what I've researched, learning how to properly value a company and the value its stock ought to have is complex; furthermore, everything I've read so far has suggested that if there were a way to ""beat the market"" with some understanding of market evaluations, everyone would have already done it and it should be priced in.  Even if you can correctly identify a stock that is worth more than its market price, a thousand unrelated and unpredictable variables could make that valuation effectively meaningless and non-actionable. 

So I'm left conflicted: obviously, big investment firms make billions and they're not all just index funds - decisions are being made on large scales that are extremely profitable, but I intuit that these are not the same strategies or decisions that scale down to individual investors, and yet individual investors continue to make these comments on ""valuation"". 

Is it really possible for an individual to know enough to actually identify undervalued stocks, and does that consistently work for anyone?  Is there any book I could read that would be educational in learning how to evaluate companies/stocks for the individual investor?",['INTU']

ma29dn,grsamuq,investing,comment,1616394655,"Perhaps my story can be instructive. I am 55 years old. I've been studying in and investing in the stock market for more than 30 years. 15 years ago I made the leap to professional status. I manage about 75 million (U.S.) and chair an investment committee that manages another 900 million. I have tried every piece of proprietary software, read about 200 books and wasted too much of my life listening to sales pitches from other managers. The short answer to your question is this: don't let hope triumph over experience. With at least most of your money stick with indexing. 

It's easy to get emotionally caught up in the culture of greed and easy money (now more than ever). But by indexing you're giving yourself the best chance of a good outcome. Even if it isn't, with some luck, your best potential outcome. 

Now, having said all that, it is possible to beat the index (S&P500 for instance) and there is some satisfaction in doing so. But the process of getting good enough to do it even somewhat consistently takes years. So that even if you eventually put a great streak of years together you may not end up with any more money than if you never tried. 

Please don't read this as any sort of ""confession."" Part of being a professional means discovering what people are really after in life and creating the most prudent investment path possible given their guidance. Most people think they're being rational about their money and investment activities when in fact ultimately most invest for emotional reasons. For instance, they won't index because they don't want to settle for average (even if indexing is actually better than average in results). Or they are emotionally attached to some companies. Or they only invest in real estate, etc. 

They best part of trying to beat the market is discovering who you are as a person in the process. But don't do it for the financial rewards because that's rarely worth anyone's time.",['SPGI']

macj6d,,investing,post,1616379613,"Analysis of IWDA and VTI investment using DCA over 5 year period 

There have been multiple discussions of the pros/cons of long term DCA investments in IWDA vs. VTI.

Typical pros of IWDA:

1. No estate tax for non-US residents (unlike VTI which has 40% estate tax on the portfolio)
2. Does not pay dividends and is domiciled based - No dividends tax for non-US residents.
3. Worlds holdings and hence more diversified (as opposed to VTI which is US-centric) on paper - I mention ""on-paper"" since >60% of IWDA holdings are based in US.

Pros of VTI:

1. Lower expense ratio of 0.03% (versus 0.20% for IWDA)
2. Pays dividends (if you need to have regular cash inflows)
3. Appears to pay more in the long term.

I begin to wonder (a) how much (if any) would the gains be like if one invests monthly via a dollar cost averaging strategy, and (b) if the gains are statistically significant. Here's the analysis and the results.

Data: Past 5-years monthly open and close prices for both stocks.

Assumptions: Fixed monthly investment (at the start of each month). No withdrawal. Ignore all dividends gains (agreed that this over-penalized VTI ).

Test: One tailed paired t-test.

Results:

1. Statistically speaking, month-on-month portfolio when investing via DCA on VTI is much more than IWDA - the p-value is < 0.0136.
2. The results of \[1\] above is skewed towards **recent surge** in US stocks. Here's visualization of what I mean \[[https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG](https://ibb.co/r4dqSqG)\] - negative values indicate VTI to give stronger overall DCA returns where we can see increase gains starting in mid 2019.

On \[2\], I re-ran the t-test by breaking into 2 time windows, where I used 30 monthly data points

1. From 2016-2018: the p-value is non significant \[p <= 0.44612\].
2. From mid2018-2021: the p-value is significant \[p<= 0.01146\]

From the above, I can see the followings:

1. VTI provides better returns than IWDA, and the better performance is statistically significant.
2. VTI stronger performance is from \*recent\* trends - which is important since all things equal, modeling future performance from recent events is likely to be more correct than modelling from long-ago events.
3. VTI give dividends, which I ignored in this analysis. Including that would show VTI to be a more superior investment.

I'm super inclined to divert /pivot my portfolio (which is on IWDA now) to VTI at least for the next 5 years, since I don't see dominance of US companies declining any time soon. Will re-evaluate again post 5 years.

Recently I've become frustrated with the quality of my option order fills on TD Ameritrade account, so I decided to investigate how much of a kickback do brokerages get for option order fills. In comparing these reports, I have deducted the following summary:

Stocks

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Does not receive payment for order flow
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Does not receive payment for order flow
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.07 / 100 shares of stock
* WeBull: Gets paid approx $0.10 / 100 shares of stock
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.12 / 100 shares of stock
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.15 / 100 shares of stock
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.18 / 100 shares of stock
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.37 / 100 shares of stock

Options

* Interactive Brokers: Pays for order fills and may receive volume discounts
* Fidelity: Gets paid approx $0.17 / 1 option contract
* Merrill Edge (BoFA): Gets paid average $0.27 / 1 options contract
* Charles Schwab: Gets paid approx $0.38 / 1 options contract
* E\*Trade: Gets paid approx $0.47 / 1 options contract
* Tastyworks: Gets paid approx $0.50 / 1 options contract
* Webull: Gets paid approx $0.52 / 1 options contract
* Robinhood: Gets paid approx $0.62 / 1 options contract
* TD Ameritrade: Gets paid approx $0.75 / 1 options contract

I'm not sure if these kickbacks translate to order fill price improvements, anyways if my reasoning is correct, would this mean that IKBR / Fidelity would have better order fills and Robinhood would have the worst at stock order fills and TD Ameritrade for options?",['SCHW']

m9dmdf,,investing,post,1616266670,"Financial Market PessimismFinancial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",

m9i525,,investing,post,1616280238,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth.Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

But, has Management indicated they are going to cut back on that spending and think they are starting to get some stickiness in their user base? They managed to grow revenues soundly, despite spending less on marketing, which is why I'm curious what has changed in just 1 year, given these expenses increased over 50% from FY18 to FY19, while rev only grew 30%.","['FB', 'EBAY']"

Most Poshmark sellers sell their product through other marketplaces as well (ebay, mercari, grailed), that offer less fees for both seller and buyer.

If POSH was tying into larger ecosystems and showing it could expand that way I might be confident enough to start a position in it, but right now I view it kind of the same way I view social networks... there is a limit to how many marketplaces (or social networks, or streaming services) people have the individual bandwidth to go to.

m9adbw,,investing,post,1616257440,"Understanding China's economy & the embedded risks: This video has a surprisingly balanced and good take describing a lot of the risks and drivers of the Chinese economy.Watch the video here please [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgVXRtq5EIg)

# Overview

For anyone who has seen me post on here, they'll realize I've long been following China's economy. Why? Because it's the primary driver of the global economy right now. And on top of that, there are a lot of \*potential\* risks that stem from China, and there is also a lot of misunderstandings and misconceptions.

I'm not one to post youtube videos as good sources of information, but this was shared with me and I noticed that this video gives a great overview of the risks and drivers within the Chinese macroeconomy.

**Why This is Important for Currency Markets & The RMB**

If you watch this, you'll probably start to understand why anybody mentioning that the idea that Chinese currency will be the next reserve currency is one of the more laughable things that gets shared on a regular basis.

If you don't want to watch the video for the point made above, the TLDR is that Chinese asset prices are driven by an extreme lack of better options for local citizens to invest in. Since China has heavy capital controls, the options for citizens to invest in are real estate, stocks, and fixed income. Stocks and fixed income have performed poorly and in a highly volatile manner, so everyone has been pushed into buying real estate.

In order for the RMB to ever become a reserve currency, China would have to do away with their internal capital controls. Problem here is that if they did this, they would likely collapse the primary driver of their entire economy since the ""there is no alternative"" effect would go away as China would then be able to invest in overseas assets.",

* Brazil
* India
* Russia
* China

The only one that is moving forward economically with much strength is China.  Those other three have fallen out of favor for a variety of means.  About 5 years ago, we we were seeing an exchange rate of 5.6 RMB to one USD.  Recently it's transposed digits to 6.5 RMB.  The same can be said of the Russian Ruble going from 56 to one USD, and now 74 to one USD.  

When your investments are analyzed and brought back, understand the FOREX component which can inflate (or deflate) your gains.  

The WSJ used to have an ""arbitrage"" portion in their paper to describe the cost of common goods like a cup of coffee or a BMW X5 (which was massive exported from the US market to the Chinese market for gain due to demand and currency price differences)  to let people know how much they're getting here, and abroad.",
m9adbw,grqeikn,investing,comment,1616355794,"I'm considering buying an apartment in China now, so I wanna share some thoughts.

Seeing as they require 30-70% as a down payment makes me feel safe about the structural health of their mortgage market. You definitely see a lot of developers starting huge projects with questionable market data. But as for the local governments, I don't think the risk is that big, as China can also just print their way out of any issue.

As for the buyers, I can share some anecdotes: I do see a big cultural change in China, where it used to be that families would live 3 generations in the same house, they now live separate. I have a lot of friends who have bought places in their home towns, so that they can move back when they get older, and can stay close to their parents. I also have friends that have bought 2nd and 3rd houses for their own kids to move in to, once they are old enough, or for their parents to get them out of public housing. This naturally increases the need for housing, even as the population is decreasing, as people now required more space per person.

One thing that really concerns me is the low yield in the rental market, at close to 1% yield you end up with a lot of empty apartments, as it's not worth it to rent them out. That is a clear sign of a overvalued housing market. But again, culture and history does explain some of the reasons.

I don't think the RMB that is used in China will become a reserve currency, but I definitely think China will be instrumental when the USD loses it's role. They've tried with a offshore RMB, but that looks like a failure. But Russia and China are working hard on a way to cut loose from the USD. It seems like China is trying to find a solution with crypto currencies, and they might a viable option there soon.",
m9adbw,grrytsx,investing,comment,1616385176,"Chinese politics aren't as one sided as folks might think.

- PBOC and other finance folks are the smart ones in the room.

- Military is filled with war mongers who don't understand economics. 

- Local leadership is pretty much corrupt.

Note that household wealth is a tiny slice of pie as opposed to business and local government wealth. In order for China to grow out of the middle income trap, both the mega wealthy and local governments will need to lose out on power and wealth. 

All above is impossible in the old model (where leaders are elected by party members), hence Xi has smartly made himself a dictator. If he plays his cards right he can slowly continue opening up capital markets while suppressing corruption and giving more wealth to the working glass rather than to political elite. 

My main fear is Xi will need to do something to appease the military/nationalists, and that something may be an invasion of Taiwan. A country that - let's be frank - if it were attacked it would spell the end for Chinese global leadership...China will end up as a Russia 2.0. US will fall back to Latin America for cheap labor, etc. 

Now...maybe China can take Taiwan and the US won't resist. Trade is now 7% of GDP and millions of Americans hold Chinese stocks in their Target Date retirement funds. This could have been their plan all along, to make our economies inseparable. 

Either way the nationalist ferver is silly and China would never become a financial center of the world if they play aggresive. Most mainlanders believe Taiwan is ""theirs"". And even though I agree...the Chinese history has always been one of a union of all Chinese. To take Taiwan by force is pointless. The value of Taiwan are the Taiwanese people and their ingenuity. The island itself is worthless. You take Taiwan by force and you gain nothing but a small piece of land. Taiwanese will leave en masse.",

I didn't know about Ordos City the video talks about, so I googled it, turns out it's a city located in Inner Mongolia, which I know from my textbook back to high school, the extreme dry, windy weather and high latitude Plateau(ah, words might be redundant, but you got what I mean). I understand that the video might be true(as I said I didn't know the city, and I believe many Chinese don't know it either, and this is the point!), but it's biased to generalize the whole country, then talk about the economics of the whole giant China(financially, it's a complex, multi-dimensional system after all), this doesn't make sense to me, anyway, this is not the first time political motivated... But, seriously, people living in this side of the world(mainly America and Europe) should at least understand how big geographically china is, and why the northern west part of China is less developed.  Mostly, minorities live there with their own languages, majority people from southern/northern east part of China where full of mountains and rivers won't choose the live there, while all the youtubers like to take this special rare sample as prove base to show the world what China is like and will be, tbh, seeing modern houses/apartments building there is actually encouraging.

Like I said, I didn't know this city, but I do know a famous singer who is from Inner Mongolia, like many others coming to southern/Northern East of China for their career, seeking opportunities, making their stories known to everyday Chinese people like me. So we know how hard it is living there, and the government is promoting/making policies that keep encouraging us fresh graduates/investors to go there help the local economics by bringing the tourism, donation, building house, utilizing the wind resources for electricity generation and teaching/educating homeless kids/orphans there etc..  Of course their lives are getting better, and still because they are minorities, the weather is just not suitable for living  in long term, not many people would like to move to live there.

With that knowledge in mind, let's come back to the video and reviews, it just makes no sense to make any conclusions/judgments about the whole Chinese economics based on those rare less developing cities while they are improving, but people buying whatever those youtubers feed to their reviewers. I'm making this comment to pint it out, as I saw so many posts and videos use this same strategy to get the attention especially on YouTube, generating revenues for themselves, while brainwashing people who don't know about China, just keep it in mind, be open and the so called democracy is defined differently in different minds of people, although we all use the same word ""democracy""!

Please don't attack me or call me CCP bot whatever, it will hurts me, makes me sad, because I'm a legit human, I have feelings, I'm just here to provide you more information. All those hates and conspiracies are from misunderstanding, and I don't like to argue with people, always choose to be positive.",

m937me,,investing,post,1616230837,"Inflationistas triggered by official CPI/PPI numbers not reflecting the inflation they see around them, are going to completely lose their minds when a few months from now, after every ""outing/entertainment"" venue is back to full capacity, the CPI/PPI still reflects as trending towards stagnancy.To summarize my argument; I think what will likely happen is that consumption by those able to spend freely right now will move from WFH areas to standard outdoors retail/entertainment. However, I DO NO think there will be any significant additional expenditure by those unable to spend right now.

There will be a DISPLACEMENT of spending, but not much of an overall increase. Certainly not enough to move the needle with the official inflation calculations.


Now, some context and clarification.

I think I broadly disagree with the general literature being flagged around ""unavoidable inflation"" in the coming months.

Specifically, I am saying that I expect there to be a displacement of inflation from some segments of the economy to others. I DO NOT expect an overall increase in inflation by any significant amount.

Among other reasons why I think this will happen:

1) People keep making statements such as ""economy fully opening up and people with pent up demand unleashing it"". There seems to be a base assumption that MORE people will spend MORE money, MORE of the time.

As I see it, this assumption is mistaken. There are still approx 9.6 million people unemployed (as JPow said, looking at unemployment numbers as continuing claims + labor participation rate drop).

Even a generous estimation of how many 10s of millions are unable to spend due to this 9.6 million unemployed will likely undercount to impacted number of people.

In other words, the K shaped recovery will continue. The poorer sections of the economy have not been saving up large chunks, despite what you might see in terms of overall bank customer savings numbers. Them getting back to their jobs will have some impact on demand for regular offline retail and some improvement in their overall finances, but not enough to move the needle towards significant inflation.

Now as to why I think the economically weaker sections are unlikely to increase their spending much:

While they were much more financially impacted by the lockdowns, a part of their unavoidable financial spending was cushioned by a combination of rent and loan moratoriums, as well as stimulus payments. So while they might get back to their jobs and have a slightly higher spending pool available, their financial requirements will increase as well.

So they increase their spending on rent and travel, but at the same time, the govt' reduces and closes down programs of emergency rent assistance and addiotional stimulus payments become less likely. So overall the total spending in the economy is increased by a much smaller proportion than expected.

Keep in as well the fact that a section of society that has so suddenly and cruely been financially impacted by a unexpected pandemic, will have atleast some lasting ptsd related to it, and are much less likely to go on a spending binge unlike their more well off counter parts.",

“Clever Leaves is a multi-national cannabis company with an emphasis on ecologically sustainable, large-scale cultivation and pharmaceutical-grade processing as the cornerstones of its global cannabis business. With operations and investments in the United States, Canada, Colombia, Germany and Portugal, Clever Leaves has created an effective distribution network and global footprint, with a foundation built upon capital efficiency and rapid growth. Clever Leaves aims to be one of the industry’s leading global cannabis companies recognized for its principles, people, and performance while fostering a healthier global community.”

Clever Leaves is a cannabis play located in Colombia. The company recently came public via a SPAC merger with Schultze Special Purpose Acquisition Corp which awarded them with 80M in cash. Growing weed in Colombia has the following advantages:

\- Sunlight 12 hours a day

\- Sunlight year around

\- Energy Efficient  ( good for the planet in the long run ) 

\- High Elevation helps with pest control.

\- Colombia already dominates flower exports.

But the greatest advantage of them all is simply: lower cost per gram of dry flower.  Clever Cost per gram of dry flower amounts to $0.20. That is right twenty cents. That’s a cost advantage of 9x compared to Canada’s average of $1.89.



Clever Leaves currently has a Cultivation Footprint of 1,900,000 sq. ft. which is comparable to those of bigger companies such as Aphria (2.4M sq ft) , Aurora (1.5M sq. ft.) .

Another key factor for Clever Leaves global success is they are one of three companies($APHA/$TLRY , $ACB , $CLVR) in the world which are both vertically integrated and are EU GMP-Certified which basically means they can sell their weed as pharmaceutical which is how weed is being establish in some places in Europe such as Germany.

“Clever Leaves was granted EU GMP certification in July 2020, establishing Clever Leaves’ facilities in Colombia as the first and only cannabis operation to be granted EU GMP certification in Latin America and one of a select few in the world”


Clever Leaves is currently a project of national importance as declared by the Colombian Govt which assigned CLVR 50% of the Colombian Production Quota which is aprox 18% of the global production quota.

Clever Leaves recently announced a partnership to supply cannabis to German pharmaceutical company Ethypharm.

Clever Leaves is currently at the end of a one-year deal to supply Canopy Growth ($CGC) with the cannabis for its south America operations. This deal has an option for up to two years renewal , it should take place around April 2021.

2. **The political risk is high**, as everywhere. We have a presidential election next year. If the ruling party wins, it is possible that they come with an even more conservative agenda. And if more progressive parties win, it is possible that regulation start supporting small producers, who today are more excluded from it.

3. **Here weed is not technified as other products**. Coffee, sugar, cocoa, flowers and others have had genetic laboratories for decades to improve cultivation and strains. Colombian marijuana is too young right now. It may lead to cool-branded and a low-priced products, but quality products are far away.

4. **Weed cultivations are in deep rural zones.** Colombian economy is stable and has good long-term expectations, but you are not investing in thriving urban start-ups. Big marijuana cultivations are still in deep rural areas that still have residual local conflicts. I understand that the Clever laboratories are in developed regions, but biggest cultivations are in disputed zones with no full peace achieved for their communities.","['PGR', 'UPS']"

The banks f-k up a lot and this translates to a domino-effect-like to retail Investors.Throwing my two cents to help put and end or at atleast  prevent retail traders jumping in on panic-selling-bandwagon. 

Major part reasons market is down recently have to do with the forced $30b Stock Sell-Off by an investment associated with Bill Hwang in relations to major US banks/brokers.

This two key notes are all is needed to tell you to relax and do not panic sell.

Read this:  👇🏼

“Typically under such a strategy, if long positions decline in value by more than the shorts, this puts them in a risky situation because they won't have enough money to cover their shorts. The fund's brokers realized this was about to happen, and so initiated margin calls. When Archegos couldn't make them, its banks forced the fund to liquidate many of its positions, Bloomberg reported, citing sources...”  

And then this: 👇🏼

“Despite Monday’s pullback, major U.S. stock indexes remain on course to post gains for the quarter...”

I haven't actually looked into it but I'm assuming tech is being shorted daily while money is moved into the ""large value"" stocks. If big money was smart they would already know a severe sell off will not work. It will just trigger tons of people to throw money in.

mfplkd,,StockMarket,post,1617024559,"Goodmorning Traders ... After the Squeeze is “squoze”... my 3/29/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY 

After the Squeeze is “**squoze”.** Can we stay up here at these levels? Some people call it a gamma squeeze, it has been popularized by gamestop traders as a short squeeze but they are one in the same. This happens when a lot of traders take one side of a trade (let's say short like the spy on Friday for example) and due to either time or lack of available shares on float, the trade goes the opposite direction causing a sharp jump in price because of short covering (which is the buying back to close positions). Team short covering with normal buy side activity and you have an influx of buying that causes the sharp price jump.  

   Time to focus on the real under currents in the market. We know the havoc that bonds and tnx are playing on big tech, However the place to watch for me now becomes the financials (xlf). Pay close attention to the advance decline lines of both the S&P 100 and S&P 500 by sectors. The only way we can maintain these price levels in the SPY is if both tech(xlk or qqq) and Financials(xlf) are positive. If both are negative, we fall hard, if they are both scattered across near 50/50 levels we consolidate for a while with the 390-area becoming the trap door. The one disturbing thing to pay attention to from Friday is that for the first time in a while we had correlation, although it was to the upside it is still correlation. Let's look at the possible outcomes for the day:1) we hold support at the 390 area and we consolidate between 391 and 395 area building energy for breakout move higher or lower. 2) we break support of 390-389 and all pops back above can be shorted for a longer period. 3) we hold support above 391which begins a journey to retest 400.  

1) we hold support at the 390 area and we consolidate between 391 and 395 area building energy for breakout move higher or lower. **45% probability**

Ok... I think we might have our multi-national insolvency event that kicks off a whole bunch of other unintended consequences:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhHdtDyQD90

This shit includes: 

- USA via Bluestone Resource's bad loans (involving the governor of WV and his spawn) and Katerra, a Softbank interest and  US ""construction tech"" company (as Patrick says...""whatever [the fuck] that is"").

- India via GFG Alliance (a *family* ""office""); nobody is really talking about the web of companies this family office runs in India, but that probably because doing so is life threatening.
 
- Australia via Lex Greensill and Greensill's need for IAG (Insurance Australian Group) to re-up 4.6 billion of credit (re)insurance.  IAG is apparently on the hook for Katerra... uh... I mean, Softbank's debt despite having their refusal to provide insurance to Greensill unadjudicated.

- Germany (vis-a-vis the EU) via Greensill Bank (used to be Nord Finance Bank) and German municipalities who put millions into that bank since it offered better than negative interest rates.  Further, this bank was used to obtain letters of credit that allowed Greensill to further perpetrate his wider, more global frauds with the massive help of GFG Alliance, which kicked of the German banking regulator's audit of Greensill (Wire~~fraud~~card anyone?)

- Switzerland via Credit Suisse's 2 billion dollar loss in this fintech catastrophe. 

- Great Britain via Greensill being allowed to operate as a quasi-bank outside of FCA regulation/authority and receiving half a billion pounds worth of COVID interruption ""loans"" (yeah, I put that in quotes for a reason).

- Japan via Softbank and Tokio Marine who might experience up to a 7 billion dollar loss to do underwriter exposure limit overreach.

Greensill's total debt liabilities (incoming and outgoing, remember, they're nothing more than an over-glorified factoring shop) stand at ~150 billion in financing in *2019* (probably more with COVID stimulus provided to them) spread over a mind numbing 10 million customers and suppliers.

My take on this is that it is so multi-national, with such an undefined final resting place for the massive, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shill debt, that no country will allow the debt to land in their jurisdiction.  In the decade plus that it takes this thing to unwind, the debt produced by Greensill will cause a cascade of insolvency that no central bank will be willing to accept on their balance sheets.  Fundamentally, this is a story of counterparty risk.  Typically these types of love triangles are hard enough to bring to a conclusion in a single jurisdiction.  Given the fact that we're taking seven or more jurisdictions, this unknown orgy of counterparties is going to be dancing in court rooms around the world for the next decade while the world burns down from the insolvency of 10 million businesses who used Greensill.

This is going to be a huge black eye for the fintech industry.  Everyone involved in anything outside of missionary position style finance should expect regulatory repercussions (that includes cryptocurrency folks).
 
In short, I think we found the next John Law and his name is Lex Greensill.

So, in closing, now that we see this shitstorm on the horizon headed in our direction, how do with make it worse in a way that allows us to profit?",

Edit: not that it's hard to find but here's some financial info.

For the year ending December 2020, Vizio reported net revenue of $2.042 billion, up from revenue of $1.836 billion in 2019 and $1.780 billion in 2018. Device revenues of $1.895 billion increased 6.9% driven primarily due to a 17.5% increase in Smart TV shipments as states across the U.S. enact stay-at-home regulations to curb the coronavirus spread. Likewise, Platform+ revenues increased 132.9% on the back of advertising revenue expansion and SmartCast active accounts increasing from 7.6 million in 2019 to 12.2 million in 2020.

The company recorded net income of $102 million in 2020, up from net income of $23 million in 2019.

I'm a long term investor, but as of late, I haven't been feeling very faithful in the future of the US. 

My fears mainly consist of: 
- The possibility of the dollar losing its reserve currency position.
- Sky rocketing national debt & consistent trade deficit. 
- The rise of China & emerging economies, possibly leading to a shift in global economic power from the west to Asia. 

I've been looking for opportunities abroad, 
A country that has gained my attention is Switzerland, mainly due to its political stability, safe currency, being somewhat isolated from the global arena (I know it's not entirely isolated, but at least not as exposed as the US).

mf5n4k,,StockMarket,post,1616953027,"FYI: Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in ‘unprecedented’ block trade selloff – mediaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly sold $19 billion worth of shares in Chinese tech and US media companies. Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. 

Continue...

“I’ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,” portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg. 
Senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move “highly unusual,” adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.
Another issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with “forced deleveraging,” the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don’t know “whether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.”","['VIAC', 'MS']"

Looking at the current Archegos Capital event, let's assumed that they are shorting Gamestop and got squeezed, and got liquidated. (no evidence indicating they are at this point, let's make that clear)

Right now, it looks like Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Credit Suisse, the banks will get the money first, nothing left for whatever people they supposed to pay for their crime.

1) Margin is best used for diversified, lower volatility portfolios. Using margin on a highly volatile portfolio like that which you describe comprising three stocks is asking for a margin call. If you get margin called, your loses will be ""locked in"", because you will not have leverage in the recovery (that is, if it comes -- which is not guaranteed).

2) You are doubly exposed to interest rates increases, which would likely both especially hurt your growth stocks and increase your margin interest.

You don't say what your current portfolio exposure is. I suggest you re-calculate what drop you could currently handle without being margin called. If you think that drop is plausible, then sell down until the drop is unlikely. Unfortunately, with your portfolio, a very large % drop is plausible.",

This will also allow them to reduce their chip cost as their fabrication facilities might have economy of scale.

&#x200B;

I added a position into Beyond Meat recently and I thought I’d throw my two cents out there. Here’s my bullish case for the BYND.

https://preview.redd.it/ctlkl3i91vp61.png?width=2914&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39e6679d6bbfc34905a90e003646ebab0b588d7

Beyond Meat recently announced some pretty sweet partnerships for the next few years. A big win is with McDonald’s for the McPlant burger. They will be the supplier for the plant based menu item for the next three years. This could possibly open the opportunity for other plant based menu items there as well. BYND will also be teaming up with Yum! Brands. There will be plant based menu items offered at KFC, Pizza Hutt and Taco Bell. This is a great opportunity for Beyond Meat to reach more customers. Last year, they announced a unique partnership with Dunkin’ Donuts and Snoop Dogg for the Beyond D-O-Double G Sandwich.

Beyond Meat also announced recently that they’re going to be expanding their products within Walmart as well. They are currently in more than 2,000 different Wal-Mart locations already. Last year Beyond Meat announced partnerships with both BJ’s Wholesale and Sam’s Club. So, now not only do they have a strong presence in the fast food industry but they are now carving out a spot for themselves in the retail space as well. Beyond Meat is in about 25,000 retail stores across the US. This includes companies like Target, Whole Foods, Kroger, Publix & Sprouts

On top of all that, earlier this year Beyond Meat announced that they would be partnering with PepsiCo for plant based products offered by the company. There’s only speculation as to what this could be but it’s just another avenue for Beyond’s customers to get hands on their product.

Personally, I think we’re entering into the age where synthetic meat and meat alternative products are an everyday thing. They only get better over time and as the flavor increases so will the customer base. Beyond Meat has already established a trusted brand and they have many customers to show for it. With these partnerships listed above it creates an opportunity for a lot of growth in the coming years. 

The market has been pulling back recently but BYND has stumbled since late January after announcing the Pepsi deal. It has brought the stock down and away from overbought levels.

mfbo7s,,StockMarket,post,1616970693,"Which sector is best to invest in long term (10 years plus)?  

I am 40 years old and up to now have played it safe by mainly investing in ETF's. I read ""a random walk down Wall street"" and followed the advice from the book on how to diversify your portfolio and have split my portfolio in the following way:

BND (Total bond market) 5%

IEML.L (Emerging markets government bonds) 5%

VUG (Dividend Growth Fund) 10%

VNQ (REIT index fund) 10%

VTI (Total US Stock market) 30%

VXUS (International index fund) 17.5%

VWO (Emerging markets index fund) 17.5%

VO (Mid cap) 5%

I think this is quite good for a long term investment of 25 years plus, but would like to invest a little shorter term in other areas in order to hopefully increase my gains. I have tried investing in individual stocks but haven't had very much success so I thought that perhaps a good middle ground might be to invest in sector ETF's. Is this a good idea?

Initially, I am thinking of investing in a ""Clean energy"" ETF for the medium to long term (i.e. 10 years plus). Is this a good idea? If so, can anyone suggest some good ""clean energy"" ETF's for me to research?

What other sectors do people think are good investments for the next 10 years or so?

mf791v,,StockMarket,post,1616957665,"Goldman sold $10.5 billion of stocks in block-trade spree Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, part of an extraordinary spree of selling that erased $35 billion from the values of bellwether stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants to U.S. media conglomerates.

The Wall Street bank sold $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. before the market opened in the U.S, according to an email to clients seen by Bloomberg News.

That move was followed by the sale of $3.9 billion of shares in ViacomCBS Inc., Discovery Inc., Farfetch Ltd., iQiyi Inc. and GSX Techedu Inc., the email said.

More of the unregistered stock offerings were said to be managed by Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter, on behalf of one or more undisclosed shareholders. Some of the trades exceeded $1 billion in individual companies, calculations based on Bloomberg data show.

Wall Street is now collectively speculating on the identity of the mysterious seller or sellers. The liquidation triggered price swings for every stock involved in the high-volume transactions, rattling traders and prompting talk that a hedge fund or family office was in trouble and being forced to sell.

Several major investment banks with ties to hedge fund Archegos Capital Management LLC liquidated holdings, contributing to the slump in share prices of ViacomCBS and Discovery, IPO Edge reported, citing people it didn’t identify. CNBC reported forced sales by Archegos were probably related to margin calls on heavily leveraged positions. Archegos is controlled by former Julian Robertson protege and Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang.

Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos’s New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn’t returned.

Price Swings

In block trades, large volumes of securities are privately negotiated between parties, usually outside of open market.

Friday’s selloff dragged companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and NetEase Inc. lower. The peers later recovered after traders said word of the offerings lessened fears that a broader trade was unfolding throughout the sector.

As you can see in the highlighted circles every time the stochRSI broke above the oversold line it made new highs. What’s the most important to note is that once it went overbought and came back to oversold, it never broke support. In fact every single time it went back to oversold it made higher lows. It has just done this again. It went oversold and held support at the previous highs. Now the stochRSI is breaking above the oversold line signaling a new test in 52 week highs as it’s done almost every time it’s made this pattern in the last several months. All moving averages are trendi by up, not a single slower moving average is above a faster moving average signaling a strong up trend. This is a pretty low risk play. If you’re wrong you lose about 4-7% on the position. If you play it well you can make about 15-20%. If you are conservative and buy right near $33 you’re looking at a 2-3% downside.

Remember: July 28, 2010: In the early days, a Bitcoin cost investors just 6¢ each, (like Dogecoin currently around .06) By Dec. 10, 2012, Bitcoin had jumped to $13.54 each. Your $100 would have made $323,055 in just over 2 years!! People actually traded BTC around that time and did not realize they were buying and selling millions of future dollars at that time and some sold most of their coins thinking they made out good...WELP..... Don't trade haha

And you don't want to know what it would be worth now because you would jump out of a f\*\*\*ing building. Will Dogecoin inevitably repeat in crypto history? You don't wanna find out too late again. Buy Dogecoin and f\*\*\*ing HOLD... Thank me later😊

BTW If you are having difficultly with any sites making very hard and annoying to open an account and go through a FIA verification process, then try the Bittrex crypto platform.

melmsl,,StockMarket,post,1616875959,"How to profit off the Suez CanalWhat the Suez Canal means for the Tanker market

Suez Canal Tanker Play

$STNG $TNK $NAT $TK $FRO

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it’ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically $STNG and $NAT, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn’t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa now. I think this could be the black swan event that kicks off a supercycle for the entire shipping industry.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in $STNG to play product tankers and $TNK to play crude.

$20 STNG 7/16 2021
$15 TNK 5/15 2021
And I have some yolo $4 NAT 4/16 calls

Edit 1:

From 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.

The supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained.


Edit 2:

it seems the ship has been refloated, disappoint but as I said I was already bullish on tankers before the Suez Canal situation. The product tanker market supply is tight and demand has is only growing. As more time passes and older ships get retired, the supply will only continue to get more constrained because no one has been building new ships anymore.

There is still a 300+ vessel traffic jam at the Suez Canal which will cause delays, I’m not sure what will happen but I am still confident there will be an upcoming bull run for product tankers",

Not worry if you lose 10% buy the contract back and take the opposite bet. Or Buy 2 contracts to collar the trade, As for OI make sure there is 100 OI on both Calls and puts these need to balance under call put parity rules!

Finally do not place trades over earning dates, You will wake up OTM or worse massively down on the trade. As the Delta rises into earnings.....so does the volitility and the velocity of change in price.

Read Bill Johnson options 101, and Meroni's ""Pricing and Hedging of Financial derivatives"" This will help you become more precise and exact with trades. If a trade looks wrong? IT IS WRONG!

Always have a profit target in mind  IE 30% upside and you are out 10% loss you are out. Remember Bulls get fat Pigs get slaughtered and options Kills pigs way faster than stocks due to the ""Short exposure time""

If you Hold 500 share of an stock ""Do Not Buy or sell 5 contracts"" use 1 or 2 contracts for selling as the objective is to lower your overall share cost.

I think I will wait for a bit more of a decline to find an entry point but with a shift to value going on right now, it might be a good pick.

If you have invested in **AACQ, PDAC, DMYI, GWAC, RTP, ACIC, QELL,NPA, HOL (+ several other ones, but these are the ones that are hyped up at times** ) you have to **be very cautious.**

\-->according companies : Origin Materials, LI- CYCLE, IONQ, CYPHERmining, joby, archer, possibly lilium, spacemobile, astra

\-->According Industries : battery recycling, Quantum computing, bitcoin mining, Electric aviation, global continuous mobile connection with no imput lag or connection loss, space launching.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-**Key take** ( **You have the right vision, but value matters, certainly with rising inflation in the upcoming years )**

I get it all these industries seem and are very enticing in the future, and you want to bet on the future. The stockmarket is forward looking, but value matters. **75% off the above stated companies will be tremendous winners in the future. But 90 % of these companies will fall below 10$ instantly after the merger.** why? no revenue for the years to come, and if they somehow have revenue in 2023, or 2024, they will be trading at 50-500x price to sales ratio.

**All the above stories can be the leaders in the according industries. ( 3 examples of possible winners )**

**Cypher mining ( GWAC** ) --> possibly the biggest bitcoin miner (hashrate wise ) and market leader in **2022/2023**

**Li-CYCLE ( PDAC ) -->** possibly the market leader in battery recycling, as the ev boom will ramp up towards 2030 ( numerous catalysts and deadlines for example CO2 emission cars will be banned in the uk by 2030 ), so lythium recycling will be a must in the future by **2024-2025**, pdac will likely explode ( imo)

**ARCHER (ACIC), JOBY (RTP), LYLIUM (QELL,ZNTE, i don't care who acquires them, I won't invest ) -->**

Elecrtic transportation will be the future,and these badboys will take part in this and acquire a percentage of the market share along side boeing, etc ( who is also developing electric airplanes so a lot of competition here ), the aviation industry will only start adopting the ev aviation wave by **2025-2026, if you are lucky the transition will start in 2024 ( this is stated by numerous airlines that they are not ready to transition yet )**

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*notice, from the time of writing, these companies will only start generating possible revenue by 2023,2024,2025,2026,**

this is min  2 years from now, so these are all current unicorns ( trading above 1 Billion dollars)by market cap, but without fukking revenue and once they start making revenue in 2023,2024, they will be trading at 100x500x price to sales ratio's , the real ramp ups are projected for 2025-2026 most of the time, this is 5 years from now.

**\*\*\* notice, consider countless risk factors, ( 3 examples of what can go wrong )**

\---- > **pdac,aacq**, construction of facilities--> construction delays, projections won't be met....

\----> **archer, joby**, problems with prototype models , can delay start of commercial sales....

\----> **hol**, not a fukking single rocket launched to date, prototype issues, no proven product, several risk factors

**\*\*\*intermezzo ( the tesla story ) , why catalysts matter.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

before you say, but big poppa, every fukking tech stock went on  massive tear, and went up, all stocks went up in 2020, hyperloop bull market babay , I say yes, but not like tesla, and many growth stocks wont maintain current levels, because they cant support the year over year growth in their respective sectors, Tesla will.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TESLA catalysts were ( in 2019-2020 )**

\- goal attained of  the production and delivery of  500 000 cars in 2020 ( not covid or bull market related )

\- (1 on chart) first 5 profitable quarters ( 5 consecutive ones )  started in 2019 ( not covid or bull market related

\- (2 on chart) inclusion in the snp 500 ( due to these profitable quarters ( requirement for snp inclusion ), not covid or bull market related )

**Consensus, I'm betting my left fukking nut, that tesla would have been trading at 400+ right now even without the covid crisis and the tech ramp up, because they had so many catalyst coming up starting in 2019.**

\*\*\* note if you followed tesla closely ( tracked their balance sheets, followed up on projections and goals ), you knew all these catalyst were coming up  or had a high likelyhood of being attained.

**TESLA catalyst was  (in 2012)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

as you see, tesla was hyped starting 15 years ago, but when should you have invested 2008 no, **2012,** that's when the revenue ramp up started  and the cars were adopted by the public ( proven products and proven growth by then ) and the share price exploded from 6 dollars to 40 dollars ( wowa those were the magic days, and yes these numbers were projected, so you could have anticipated on that catalyst, as you can now with the current promising companies and their projections. )

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Outro ( Don't fomo just because of your future conictions )**

**recommendation** : **Get the fukk out now, while you still can**, or explode with the bubble, **BUT,** write these fukking companies down, follow their progress, and schedule catalysts in. when will the factories be completed?; when will they start commercial sales, when will the factories start running, when will they report the first revenues, when will they launch their first fukking rocket, follow them closely, invest in them once the catalysts are ramping up after each other. From the above stated companies, you will have tesla stories in different industries ( scale up wise ), these companies have unlimited potential, but this is future potential, with no catalyst right now. use your brain and bide your time to strike.

(\*\*\* if you can't escape your fomo feaver, and you are scared these companies will explode right now ( highly unlikely ) , I recommend you start a very small starter position now, if you truly have high conviction in these plays, and you average down once the share price plummets after the mergers.

**free info and my plan** : based on revenue ramp up and investor presentations ( + variables along the way) I  will invest in the following companies by timeframe and because I have the  highest conviction in them an the value they could offer ( if they achieve earlier revenue projections and facilities are set up according to these projections and they still have the same revenue ramp up outlook.)

**NPA: end of 2023,  start of 2024**

**AACQ : end of 2024,  start of 2025**

**GWAC : end of 2022, start of 2023**

**PDAC: end of 2024, start of 2024**

**EVtols: ACIC, RTP, QELL:  2024 range**

Full disclosure! : no position in any of the spacs mentioned in this thread for all the reasons stated above and because I'm not a  sufferer of the FOMO feaver, I'm dead inside. I will 100% start a postion in some of these companies in the future for all the reasons stated above.

mekhr6,,StockMarket,post,1616872537,"Are tech growth stocks being manipulated for stop loss harvesting?My tech stocks portfolio is in big red, some titles (e.g. CCIV) even -60%...NIO keeps going down, with some bull traps happening in-between.

My intuition tells me that the big institutional banks are trying once again to screw retailer investors over...

* They know many of us have piled into these types of stocks in the previous months
* They are pissed at the GME 'rebellion'
* So what do they do? They cause panic selling and stop loss harvesting, by asking their friends at Bloomberg to push news about 'these companies are too overvalued', driving prices down and down
* They put some bull traps in-between to fuck us over even more
* In the meantime, the buy the dips, and when they decide that the sell-off is over...they bagged a lot of stocks with potential at a discount",
mekhr6,gsiv85f,StockMarket,comment,1616887630,"When people were pumping CCIV and I pointed out how stupid an investment it is, people responded with a disgusting level of vitriol.

But money doesn't care about hurt feelings. Even Cramer said a couple days ago, they're just pieces of paper. You're not supposed to love them or hate them. Or to paraphrase, don't get your panties in a bunch.

Of course NIO is going down, look at the way China is attacking their trade partners over criticism of human rights violations. They don't seem to understand it is impossible; literally, impossible; for them to win that sort of battle. Nobody is going to stop criticizing them over human rights violations because they got angry about the complaints. On the contrary, it deepens resolve to confront them, and widens the economic impact.

Meanwhile, the SEC is implementing rules requiring companies to follow GAAP accounting in order to remain listed on US exchanges. Does NIO follow GAAP? No. Would it be legal in China for NIO to start following GAAP? No. You can wave your hands and say, ""Oh, they'll find a workaround."" But it might not be that simple. Even if NIO continues to have success in China, and even if they have success in expanding to the US market, that doesn't guarantee that they will remain investable on American exchanges.

Tech stocks generally are not the same thing as SPACs, nor are they the same thing as US-listed foreign companies. Blithely mixing them all together under ""tech"" just prevents it from making sense.

Ok. Next. Do large traders engage in buying patterns designed to harvest your limit orders? Absolutely. Notice I didn't use the word ""manipulation?"" Because it isn't. When people post selective nonsense that they call ""DD"" about some specific stock on social media to pump the price up, that's manipulation. Trading, however, is not manipulation, and when you call it that you cause yourself brain damage; you change what connections happen in your brain when you hear the different words. In a way that harms your ability to processes financial news and information. There is no need to sound cool; it helps in no way. Hyperbole is not your friend. Believing that professional traders are your enemy is a good idea, but believing it is wrong of them to use their market power just gets in the way of your understanding the market. Nobody is trying to ""screw you over."" Nobody cares about you. They're trying to make money. Once you realize that, you'll be much better positioned to learn how to make money yourself. Stop crying about being the little guy; the stock market was not designed to enrich the little guy. It was designed for the rich to do financial combat with each other. If you're a little guy, that means you need to stay out from underfoot, and learn how to harvest the scraps. Because the reality is that there are techniques that you can use when you're small, that the big boys can't use because they'd move the prices. If you're smart enough, clever enough, and honest enough, you can beat the market by a lot, at least while you're still small.",

mekc3f,,StockMarket,post,1616872080,"Average Down VS Investing in Successful StocksI’m fairly new to stocks (barely a year in) and I would like to seek out help.  I usually only put money into stocks every 2 weeks (every paycheck).  Question is; since I have limited resources, would it be better for me to utilize my allotted money for a stock that lost ~%25 or a stock that is steadily increasing? 

I’m trying to get more bang for my buck.  

For example, $DKNG and $V are steadily increasing in value.  And quite frankly these are my two favorite stocks. They already make up about %40 of my portafolio.  

VS

$RIOT which I like as well but dropped a considerable amount. Would it be better to get that “on sale”?",
mekc3f,gshrwq5,StockMarket,comment,1616872731,"With RIOT in particular, if you watch it closely, it can be very predictable. It fluctuates quite a bit, 20% usually. It flows with the price of a c0in that I cannot mention on this sub. EBON is much similar and less volatile percentage wise, and follows the c0in much more closely. EBON seems to only bounce between 7.80ish and $10. 

Anyways, to the broader strategy I'm picking up on, it's almost as though you feel obligated to invest every two weeks. That is a habit that can possibly screw you. Not every payday is a good day to invest. If you are looking for stocks every two weeks to invest in, just for the sake of investing, it may come back to bite you. 

If the fundamentals are good, and DD has been done, and do you have faith that the company's stock is undervalued, then by all means, averaging down would be something to consider.

If you are scalping or day trading, none of that matters. It's only about the charts, momentum, and discipline, remember that pigs get slaughtered. 

Anyways, I know this doesn't quite answer anything, but just some things to think about.",
mekc3f,gsim9zf,StockMarket,comment,1616882786,"I'm a newbie in stocks as well ( a little over 6 months ) and I can tell you whats changed for me in the past month or so since the markets have tanked. When I first started out I was buying in slices and putting money in every week spreading it out between the those that were starting to fly ( mostly tech stocks ). 

Now that the there is a downturn things have changed. Almost all those high flying stocks are down. 

1. I no longer invest weekly in stocks, BUT I do continue to transfer the same about to the brokerage.  When a good entry point comes I'm ready.
2. I no longer buy slices. Instead I buy multiples using a market limit.
3. I now take profits at 35%. Something I couldnt do when buying slices. 

I have a couple of stocks that are down 20%. As long as the fundamentals are the same and I expect it to go back up, I'm taking the opportunity to get in as low as possible ( using a limit order ).

In short, I started off just building my portfolio. Now I'm trying to maintain and maximize and future profits by average down on long term stocks. If I come across another high flying growth stock I'll get in and get out and take those profits to a dividend stock. 

As I grow, I'm sure my strategy will change along with whatever the current market is.

mezsyx,,StockMarket,post,1616931389,"The entire market looks horrendous on the weekly chart and 3 days left to confirm the monthly chart.Thursday was looking so bad if they just let it go but they came at full force and all saved their stocks.

I thought Friday March 26th was going to be like Friday March 5th,

 instead it's going to be Monday March 29th, Monday opening dip to possibly new lows.

The weekly says it needs to happen. Do you seriously think they let the monthly chart just let go like it is right now.. no because then we have another MARCH 2020 Market crash, this is just a correction for 2021. There has never been 2 market crash in 2 consecutive years in a row, learn from the past.

So in order to not lose the monthly, the dip needs to happen on Monday then we come right back up and end at a reasonable spot for Wednesday March 31st the most important day of the month.

That dip on Monday cannot happen on Tuesday or Wednesday because it won't have enough time to bounce back up to a reasonable level for March 31st.

If the dip doesn't happen on Monday that means it will happen on Thursday April 1st or Friday April 2nd and hopefully by mid April the market starts going up for good.

If you don't stay in the market long term many years before cashing out then I do the following to give me better odds:

In general, January is the best month it goes sideways or uptrend , March is the worst month it goes sideways or downtrend.

I usually 

- Sell before Valentine's Day at the best price you can
- Buy at the best price I can get in March (usually I try to predict close to where I think the company wants to drop its stock)

- Buy end of year best price Nov-Dec

You'll need a direct access brokerage account. Then it is easy. You will likely have to pay commissions, you'll only be able to buy in multiples of 100 shares, and most platforms have a $25k account minimum.

What you can do, though, for example with Fidelity you can use two orders to do something similar. First you set up your trailing stop loss normally. Then you set up a multi-contingent order, where the first condition is that it is below some limit. This won't float with your trailing stop loss, so this isn't perfect. But you can update it once in awhile, so you can stay pretty close. Then the second condition is a ""day change % up"" buy order.👼",
mech54,,StockMarket,post,1616846615,"My last DD on MOMO Inc. - from Buffett type cigar butt with 33% margin of safety to growth turnaround with 380% upside!Here is something I wanted to share because the question is if the MOMO Inc. share price is at rock bottom at current levels.

First, I want to dive into the recent insecurities regarding Chinese tech stocks listed at U.S. stock exchanges.

I also want to address risks involved in ADRs compared to original shares.

Further some political and cultural infos and thoughts.

Then we get back to valuation and see if we are trading at a sound margin of safety at the moment and how future prospects look. Feel free to challenge my assumptions anytime and leave comments. I am happy to discuss.

I wish I could have provided more links but stupid reddit has a problem with posting myy article then.

Disclaimer: I have shares and options in the company and this analysis is no investment advice. The information is subject to change and does not guarantee completeness or accuracy and relies on other sources that are or are not professional.

**Risk of delisting of Chinese tech stocks listed at U.S. stock exchanges**

This article brought back instant insecurity because it reminded investors of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The HFCA Act became law on December 18, 2020 signed by Trump. Grandpa Biden did not turn to a softer approach like the Chinese hoped but is actually quite famous for hard-ball politics.

The SEC move comes at a bad time because it adds fuel to the fire as Chinese big tech faces regulatory threats by the Chinese government and tech stocks have been volatile due to inflation worries as well. So basically, another factor that boosts insecurity and volatility.

But back to the actual threat. Chinese companies have to comply in order to not be delisted. These are the things that I consider the most important ones:

1. Chinese companies need to comply and accept an audit of their audit papers by the PCAOB.
2. Chinese companies must disclose if one of their board members is a government/party official.
3. There is a period of three consecutive non-inspection years, meaning there is a de facto three to four years period until delisting might take place.
4. In the meantime, that issue is further subject to negotiation by the US and China in their efforts to get along together.

You can find a list of Public Companies that are Audit Clients of PCAOB-Registered Firms from Non-U.S. Jurisdictions where the PCAOB is Denied Access to Conduct Inspections, called “Public Companies that are Audit Clients of PCAOB-Registered Firms from Non-U.S. Jurisdictions where the PCAOB is Denied Access to Conduct Inspections” on the PCAOB's website.

There are 197 Chinese and 72 Hong Kong companies listed and MOMO is of course part of the list. So within the next three or four years, there are countless scenarios that might happen and I assume that actual delistings in huge amounts is a scenario with a low likelihood.

The two countries are so dependent from one another that the downside is too huge as far as my understanding goes, but I am not a politics expert, I am an investor. It is also possible that those companies will go for a secondary listing in one of the Chinese exchanges, so you might have to convert your stock or ADR/ADS and pay a transaction fee, but trading on a foreign exchange when financial markets are all connected real-time, what do I care on which stock exchange I am listed.

And within the next years, I do not see an immediate effect that would influence my investment decisions. I do however expect short term shakes in Chinese share prices that will fade over the course of a few months. Depending on media will keep on exploiting the issues.

**Are ADRs risky in the current situation?**

I read a comment in one of my posts that addressed this topic, so I took a look at that. You can read a lot about it in the F-1 amendment on the SEC/Edgar System.

Basically, you are not owner of the particular physical Class A share.

Real Class A shares are being deposited at a depositary (usually a bank or broker if I read everything right), then called American Depositary Shares. This bank/broker issues papers that grant you the right to one of those deposited, real shares – called American Depository Receipt or ADR. The ADR is listed at the stock exchange and can be traded. I do not know exactly which is the case with MOMO in general, on some exchanges it says ADR, in others it’s ADS like NASDAQ). It is nothing uncommon as they represent some of the most familiar companies in global business, including household names such as Nokia, Royal Dutch Petroleum (maker of Shell gasoline), and Unilever. (As far as I noticed, ADR and ADS are used interchangeable very often so that might be a little confusing).

The company or the depositary can cancel the ADR program, but you will get notice in advance and have time to act. You can also contact the depositary and change your ADR to real Class A shares, but I don’t know how you can trade them then, maybe over the counter.

Another risk is, when the company cancels the ADR program that they just offer you to buy out which can really suck because it might happen to a discount. But I did not a legal deep dive here what’s the case with MOMO.

I did not dive super deep into that and the bottom line to me is, yes, there are risks or inconveniences that might occur and those may result in fees and price fluctuations that you need to stomach. To myself, I do not see an immediate risk here, but it might happen, and you might want to prepare for that, at least do some research on how this worst-case scenario works and what you might have to do.

I have contacted the IR of MOMO Inc. and try to find out the current depositary, it was Deutsche Bank in 2014.

It is a common practice for many major companies, so to me it’s like reading the side effects of prescription drugs. You want to know what might happen and who you need to call when it happens. In the meantime, take as prescribed.

**Political and cultural factors**

MOMO Inc.’s Tantan app was banned from app stores due to accusations of promoting prostitution etc. So, you see the government interferes when something doesn’t run according to their plans or view of the world. But that is also a chance here, which I want to explain in a bit.

Also, Chinese culture is still pretty conservative and usually your parents or grandparents suggested your spouse or wanted you to get married soon, whatever. I have read some articles on that, but that’s old-fashioned and the MOMO products are addressed to the younger generation.

And also, the party will most likely adapt to the modern views, because they have to and they will want to.

And here are the chances for MOMO.

1. They have cleaned up their user ecosystem and the ban was in 2019. They have the worst behind them here and are ready to move forward being compliant with the government’s view.
2. As stated in my previous article, Also the government might have an incentive to support dating, since birthrates in the republic are down massively. The 2019 figure marked the lowest point since the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949.
3. Chinese government is focusing on the soon-to-be monopolies like Alibaba, JD.com, Tencent etc. MOMO is a dwarf compared to them. They have data, yes, but they are not a threat to the government regarding money, credit, sales monopolies, pricing power etc. Saying that, wait until Amazon controls prices, goods, delivery logistics etc. Government will step in as well and then what. Chinese government is just stepping in earlier.
4. The Q4 earnings transcript describes the long-term view of the founders and their reactions towards the coming years strategy and product wise. “\[…\] Many of you would agree with me that the coming 10 years we'll see continuous boom of China's private consumption and it will be gearing up from a goods driven mode toward a service and new consumption driven model. \[…\] During the past couple of years, we have consistently observed a key trend that young people in China are demonstrating strong willingness and rising consumption power to pay for dating services. I believe that such trend is going to continue or even accelerate in the coming decade. \[…\] Long-term wise the best way to take advantage of such secondary trend is certainly to supplement the subscription base model with a good non-sub base value added service mechanism. This is indeed one of our key priorities in the coming few years. \[…\] But actually in the coming 3 to 5 years, Tantan should actually have bigger potential -- bigger revenue potential in the form of VAS than Momo has today.”
5. The use of the Tantan/Tinder system is highly addictive. If you have friends or used the app yourself, you will know. There’s also a study that proves it.

Of course, you can never be 100% sure Chinese government doesn’t interfere out of nowhere, but I think that avoiding monopolies and take steps to keep platforms clean of prostitution are kind of good steps actually.

**Further valuation**

Last week was hard to stomach, earnings surprise of over 40%, MAU decline despite COVID effects in the harsh Chinese lockdown were lower than expected, dividend announcement, more cash on hands than end of 2019…and the price drops sharply. So, I wanted to see if the recent downgrades and upgrades represent fair levels of valuation. I do not know what factors they include in their modelling, but I kind of can figure out what they leave out or what the assumptions are and that I want to share with you.

As I stated in a short article yesterday, on what real multiple/ration the stock is trading at.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/u8yaqj539kp61.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=d48c92f71f3ba1e071cc2e674036641782a44ea3)

That is like buying out the small grocery store owner across the street. Not even because usually you take EBIT multiples, this is net income multiple. Insanely cheap…By the way, trick question: What’s BUMBLE’s net income?…ha ha ha. Right now, if you bought the whole company for the market cap of $2.8bn, half of it is just cash from left to right pocket. After not even 5 years, you got the rest back

But that multiple is just a fact and totally worthless, you need to compare it. Valuing means comparing, so I took a few other angels of view.

The first two are based on Customer Acquisition Costs and Tantan purchase price.

These are the average Customer Acquisition Costs for apps:

[Statista](https://preview.redd.it/zrdcxwq39kp61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=301aaa87e02c16d283e4579501feed4b829fec67)

If you take the non-cash premium you would pay and regard only the paying users as asset, the registered-only users would come at a discount of 66,6% at the current valuation.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/1gxrgwb49kp61.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7a1ab75e4bbd5c4a22947c1fa468a6a4b6d69d)

If you take the non-cash premium and value Tantan with the purchase price in 2018, implying the value has not changed one bit (although growing from 100m users to 360m users), you get the MOMO non-paying user for a discount of almost 71%.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/zw4gtuz49kp61.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=e47ea827aa50edd27e6ceb1d1f09c1349f772349)

Before moving to the third approach, it is important, what the above-mentioned valuations imply:

* Users are only valued at the Customer Acquisition Costs and no additional value (like profiles, user interaction, user data, etc.) are taken into account.
* No advertising value is taken into account.
* No brand value, moat or brand loyalty are taken into account, implying that you can come up just with another dating app, pay cash on the table for each user and boom they are on your app using it and paying for it.
* No further growth will ever be achieved.
* No further product development will improve the current situation.
* No further and better monetization of user base will be adopted.
* Situation stays “forever-COVID”.

And even if user numbers are faked, doubled or exaggerated and the remaining Customer Acquisition Costs are at $3.50, you still have the company at the “fair rock bottom price”.

The following approach takes valuation of other companies into consideration, our old friend BUMBLE will be the yard stick again. We take the non-cash premium again as a starting point and deduct the MOMO users as they are at full Customer Acquisition Cost. The remainder from the premium would then be the implicit virtual price you would pay for Tantan. Take the number of paying users and you get the virtual price for the paying users.

Now we do the same with BUMBLE. Since bumble has no net cash on hands, produces a net loss, the shareholders’ equity strictly consists of inflated goodwill and intangible assets. Since there is no net cash (in fact, net cash is negative), the market cap compensates a de-facto cash negative position.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/r1bizxn59kp61.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcfa5d294651226f1d34f3ff190e1a84cee60c7)

Comparing the implicit prices for paying users only, you see that the discount compared to BUMBLE is 96%...isn’t that crazy??

We also need to keep in mind further positive factors:

* MOMO is highly profitable and has strong tailwinds in the coming years.
* There is brand value und switching costs from their platforms to others.
* As MOMO states in the last earnings transcript, marketing costs have skyrocketed during 2020, so you won’t get even closely to the Customer Acquisition Costs from the past.
* In the coming years, product improvements and monetization will revive growth in the user base and the cash positions.
* The company is conducting a share buyback program, has the pockets full of cash and still $250m to spend.
* They pay dividends.
* They use the cash cow MOMO to develop Tantan and get back to huge growth.
* Remember that China keeps out foreign competition if it wants to and the Chinese has an enormous amount of people.
* The risks for investors are real, but one can prepare and long-term investors can sit out short term fluctuations.
* I consider management honest since they do not sugarcoat facts and warn investors that they need to focus on a growth turnaround and put real user growth first, numbers second.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

At the current valuation the company is valued even below asset prices from my point of view.

[Own Calc](https://preview.redd.it/jc8krhi69kp61.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7eb8b4ab61faef819de6018cd1cfb5ca0685ab)

Plus, net cash of $1.315bn (see above) values the company at historic user base cost of around $4bn. That’s a 33% margin of safety from here to liquidation price. On top you have the user data and the future business that brings cash into our pockets.

1. MOMO Inc. is at least a **digital Buffett typical cigar butt that offers a 33% upside to $19 a share from a share price of $14.50.** (Guess that’s Citie’s point of view as well)
2. MOMO Inc. is a cash machine and I assume a **fair valuation** in a range from **$25-$40 a share**.
3. MOMO Inc. is at max a strong and highly anticipated turnaround with a potential max. upside over the next years to **$70 a share** (using current BUMBLE valuation or expectation).","['BLL', 'AMZN', 'NDAQ', 'IR', 'DE']"

Evidently, options are trading at a discount at present. 

You can use historical volatility and implied volatility to calculate the probabilities of an Option expiring ""In The Money"" by April 01, 2021 expiration date.

Using historical Volatility the probabilities of
NIFTY > 14,600  is 42.4%
NIFTY < 14400  is 41.2%

NIFTY < 14550  is 53.5%
NIFTY > 14450 is  58.7%

What these probabilities are indicating that NIFTY will trade between 14,500 and 14,550 for April 1 Expiry

Now using Implied Volatility for 14,600 Call and 14,400 PUT Options:

Nifty > 14,600 is 39.8%
Nifty < 14,400 is 35.9%

Knowing that NIFTY will probably be range-bound between 14,450 and 14,550,. we can use the IRON CONDOR strategy to trade the index. The strategy can be constructed as follows:

1. Buy 14300 PE
2. Sell 14400 PE

me2dpw,,StockMarket,post,1616804606,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 26, 2021. (Sorry for the late post)**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

**Highlights** 

* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. 
* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan
* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the company’s largest backer.
* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.
* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.

Fourth Column: Average price i bought the stocks

Seventh Column: Profits of the stock i didn't ""take"" yet. Its the profit from the last time i bought again the specifiv stock. For example i firstly bough Mytilineos at 7,05 at the Spring of 2020, i sold, to put my gains in the pocket, i bought again later in a dip, and etc. 

Eighth Column: Total profits i have until today in this stock (for the pieces i obtain now, it doesnt include profits that i had for more pieces i dont own now)

Now, i want to write some more things, about my choices.

1. Hellenic Telecommunication Organisation. Current price 13,58. I already have sold the stock at 14,56 and i bought again at 13,165, so now i go for a second round of profits. Good company, she increased her profits during the covid crisis, and is going to give a nice dividend (0,68 euros per share or 5% dividend yield), if someone owns its stocks at 25th June. Its going to give an extra dividend about September or October. The extra dividend is calculated around 0,40 euros per stock (extra 3% dividend yield).  Total dividend yield in current price 8%. I also expect to see the stock price at 15,50 euros until summer and then i will decide if i will sell or wait to take the dividends.
2. Mytilineos. Mytilieos is the diamond of my choices. I began my journey on Fevruary 2020, i bought some pieces at 8,5 euros per stock, then i bought the same number of stocks at March 2020 at 5,5 euros per stock and the average price was 7,05. I sold and bought again a lot of times. I had 150 pieces and i was in a need of cash so i kept only 30. I totally have gained 820 euros from Mytilineos. Mytilineos is a group of companies with activities all over the world. Its one of the most productive Aluminium companies (Aluminium prices are really high this period) in the world with very low product cost. Mytulineos also is the biggest private Energy Company in Greece both in production, wholesale and retail market. Also is one of the biggest Natural Gas Company in Greece. But its big Advantage is that Mytilineos Owns  a lot of Solar Parks in Greece, Australia, USA, UK etc. Also is one of the 10 best Solar Parks constructors all over the world. Finally Mytilineos Group owns one of the biggest greek construction company.I expect that Mytilineos will rise its revenues and profits at 2021, 2022, and 2023 and 2023 profits will be double comparing to 2020. Mytilineos current price is at 13,77 and is going to give a dividend of 0,36 euros per stock on June.  Mytilineos has strong possibilities to ender at MSCI Greece Standard Index on May rebalance, and i estimate this will increase stocks price about 10%. I expect to see Mytilineos stock price between 16-17 euros during 2021 and between 22-25 at 2022
3. Wp Carey REIT. I think you know better than me this company. WP Carey is my first try at USA's stock market, so i decided to play safe. Quarter dividend of 1,048$. I am lucky that dollar is more expensive now about 1,5% than when i bought these stocks.  I haven't decide if i will wait to take the divident or i will sell on Monday or Tuesday. I bought at 69,22 and now the price is 71,36 (3% up) plus the fact the dollar is now more expensive, my total profits is 4,5%. If the price go around 72,5 i will sell before the 31st of March that i have to own the stocks to take the dividend. I intend to buy again on first days of April, where i expect to find a price around 65 dollars per share and then sell again before dividend's xdate. 

Well i put a discussion flair, because i want your opinions about my portfolio and especially if you think that a strategy to buy after the dividend's date and sell 1-2 days before in a REIT is viable. I mean i noticed that usually the stock dips after the divident and rises before the divident, so i decided to exploit this think.",['MSCI']
medo78,gsi1hxc,StockMarket,comment,1616875711,"Your plan for WP Carey doesn't make sense to me, but maybe I am misunderstanding. What is the point of selling the stock right before the dividend date? You are correct that In theory  the stock goes down when they pay the dividend, but the difference is in accordance with how much the dividend pays out. So selling right before the dividend pays out vs holding and taking the dividend doesn't really result in much of a difference, especially considering you only have 2 shares.",

2. I also think after the covid crisis comes to the end in about 2 months real estate properties will rise their values, so i think these companies will give bigger dividend.",

mfo2qo,,wallstreetbets,post,1617019514,"Possible $GME Catalyst Incoming Tomorrow🚀# October 2020 Catalyst

The OG's remember when GameStop announced its deal with Microsoft and the stock saw a spike in volume and price. This was officially announced at the Third Bridge interview on 21st of October 2020. The relevant tickers for this event were Microsoft (Obviously because of the deal), Sony and Nintendo (For the upcoming console news).

Here is a screenshot from the ol' Bloomie Termie showing this event:

&#x200B;

[The event that lead to the Microsoft catalyst \(21 October 2020\)](https://preview.redd.it/aj99lxt4jyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf98afcdbda9cb76aa86a30c0c46d2c736e2d16f)

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Now I present to you a possible Catalyst: the Iron to the Nitrogen and Hydrogen

On the 30th of March 2021 *(20:00 London/ 15:00 New York/ 03:00 Shanghai)* GameStop will be having another interview with Third Bridge and it has been named ""GameStop - E-commerce Transformation & Structural Business Overview."" This may be the reason why the leadership kept quiet about their future in the earnings call last week. They may have been holding out on any announcements so that Third Bridge could get the juicy news. But then again these are speculations coming from an A-Grade dumbass. So October was about the Microsoft deal and the upcoming console cycle. What do we have coming tomorrow? Take a look at the agenda on the image below:

&#x200B;

[Look at the agenda above. Notice the relevant tickers.](https://preview.redd.it/nr2p6gsajyp61.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc09b1a7391b012e51f90239906f689800e18997)

&#x200B;

The agenda above is exclusively linked to GameStop just as it was in the first image for the October interview. I say this because you may see Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy are listed as the relevant tickers for this interview. This is not about them. This involves them but the interview is about GameStop's future. Could those four companies be mentioned tomorrow in a huge deal that will spearhead the transformation of GameStop? I think so.

&#x200B;

As a corporate move last week's earnings call seemed to be like a massive dud of a catalyst. This is strategic in my opinion. If I knew that our earnings would not meet expectations why would I mention my huge Ace in my hand? I would not risk the negative image of the below-expectations earnings tainting my major announcement for the future. Again this could also be about PS5 restock news and this is not a catalyst.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TL;DR

\*\*Possible catalyst = GameStop has an interview tomorrow discussing their future with the same firm that they had an interview with when they announced the Microsoft deal in October 2020. Tomorrow's announcement also includes $AMZN, $WMT and $BBY as linked tickers to tomorrow's announcement.\*\*

&#x200B;

*any arguments or clarifications are welcome*

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Relevant tickers are likely due to those companies being direct GameStop competitors [https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop](https://www.similarstores.com/like/GameStop)

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Removed rockets because people think that I am predicting a squeeze. This is purely an informative piece and is by no means a shot in the dark to predict the MOASS. Hold and take all information with a grain of salt.

While that is certainly a possibility, more likely is the fact that these are GameStop's four main competitors in the E-Commerce video game space. In order to talk about GameStop's success, they will need to talk about the plan to compete with these giants.","['AMZN', 'WMT', 'BBY']"

Archegos Capital, a prop trading firm run by Bill Hwang (apparently not a smart man), managed to completely blow up his $80 billion portfolio in true WSB fashion, the sheer idiocy and magnitude of this blowup makes us all look like mormon choir boys. This fucking guy had 5:1 leverage on $16 billion of capital invested in china growth/tech *at the peak of the fucking tech surge*, and *didn't fucking de-leverage* during the most obvious sector rotation ever 6 weeks ago. It's all gone now. Liquidated. To zero. He was heavy into china tech / growth stocks on 5x margin, $80 billion portfolio. Poof. 

Margin calls probably started on Monday of last week, where forced liquidation took place. Rumor has it, all of the different PB's this guy borrowed margin from agreed to an orderly selloff during the forced liquidation, but some unknown PB front ran them like a total cocksucking wench and liquidated all at once, causing a violent crash in BIDU and Viacom.

So if you were trading late Friday as I was, you noticed the crazy EOD upward action in the SPY **AND RKT** (pictured above)

We found out over the weekend that a major HF blew up on Friday. Archegoes had 15 Billion in capital that they used for 80 Billion in longs and **40 BILLION IN SHORT TRADES.**

Right now the long side of the book is making all news **BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT 40 BILLION SHORT BOOK????**

Notice how EOD Friday the SPY **AND RKT** shot straight up together? We know Archegoes was short the SPY and judging by the price action in RKT I would say they were also going short RKT (ie: long rates and short mortgage brokers)

**HOWEVER**

RKT is more of a fintech than a traditional mortgage broker **AND RKT PRINTS MONEY  \[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅\]**

Here are some fun RKT stats:

***RKT made 15 bill last year and 9 of that was NET income***

108 million share float

112 million shares owned by institutions

5.8 million shrs owned by insiders

BILLION $$$ Buy Back

Guided Q1 UUUPPPP 90%-99% YoY (I heard they are running +150% and **Q1 will BLOW OUT TO THE UPSIDE**)

Do what you will with this guessformation (RKT EOY EPS = $6 = ***RKT HUGELY UNDER VALUED CURRENTLY***)

Archegos never filed anything with the SEC and they have ties to blackrock. Blackrock sells a bunch of shares to put cash in the war chest. Then they throw a shell HF with no assets to the MSM so there is someone to blame. The amount of DISC, VIAC , etc that was sold can only be owned by Blackrock, Vanguard or sometimes Morgan Stanley. Then blackrock comes out today and says THEY GOT CASH FRIDAY. Also the stocks that plummeted were Citadel longs so shitadel just got pushed closer to margin call. Also RC & Blackrock have been buddies for a while. DFV tweeted the rock remember? Archegos existed purely as a scapegoat. Citadel hurt Blackrock last year on Tesla. Blackrock is ready to fuck citadel back. They got money, just took out one of citadels legs and haven’t even started to squeeze.

mfr62k,,wallstreetbets,post,1617029309,"Palantir (PLTR) is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is why.First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.

Even forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. 

If you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. 

Palantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.  He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?

To sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words:  “We are going to deliver the world’s best software with the world’s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that’s worth to them. And I think you’ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.” -Karp the day they went public","['PYPL', 'FB']"

mfsgf7,,wallstreetbets,post,1617032880,"Transocean's Hedge Fund Historical Manipulation and What is in ProgressA couple of weeks ago I started to notice something suspicious for Transocean (RIG) in terms of spikes in certain options volume as well as spikes in volume in its bond pricing along with its bond swaps (Put Options for Bonds). As the weeks go by my suspicion came to fruition so I'd like to take this opportunity to share my observations with everyone and at the same time show a good example of a breakdown of how a typical hedge fund employs their shorting strategy against a traditional company, in this case Transocean (RIG).

I will do my best to dumb everything down since I know some of our audience are still eating crayons and sniffing glue.

**The Hedge Fund Play:**

In the middle of 2020, when oil was still trading relatively low, I noticed a large rise in volume of a series of Transocean Debt (Bonds) and also a spike in the volume of bond swaps which I assume was used by hedge funds to hedge their bets. At the same time, I noticed a steady and large rise in shorted Transocean stock, which means a hedge fund or hedge funds were hoping the company would go into bankruptcy like almost all of Transocean's peers in the industry. I know it was hedge funds because most institutional investment funds are not allowed to short due to how they are regulated.

Based on the volume movement and price action of trading of Transocean debt and its swaps, it looks like a hedge fund was primarily concentrated in a strategy of bankruptcy restructure arbitrage which means if Transocean does go into bankruptcy they can make more money in the bankruptcy restructure since Transocean's secondary offerings were at the time, traded well under their true book value (Sort of like Gordon Gekko with Blue Star Airlines in the movie Wallstreet). The problem with this was Transocean's extremely competent management choosing to put up a fight.

To take advantage of market conditions, Transocean hires Lazard Freres & Co. to help them restructure a good amount of their debt without going into bankruptcy which they did. As a result, a Hedge Fund called White Box Advisors (WBA) revealed itself and rallied a couple of other bond holders and took Transocean to court claiming that Transocean technically went into default when it proceeded with the debt restructure. Lazard backed up Transocean to reassure that Transocean did not go into default and everything Transocean did was legal and well within the requirements for its shareholders.

I was actually able to go over court transcripts and from the looks of it, it was primarily Transocean's lawyers arguing and going into details in court. WBA's lawyers were relatively quiet in comparison and from the outside, it is just too obvious that they didn't really have a real case. So this just looks like it was put on just for a show for the investors.

Over the next few months, numerous short ladder attacks were conducted on Transocean stock back up by coordinated continuous random spike in numerous bear articles focusing on the lawsuit and repetitive same bear information from a number of freelance writers primarily on Seeking Alpha and others doing everything they can to drive the price of Transocean's stocks down.

Keep in mind that whoever bought those bond swaps earlier essentially bought put options on Transocean's bonds. Most Bond prices do correlate well to the direction of its stock's prices, so whoever owned them was winning on the front of bearish investor sentiment with the lowest being October. Finally, market forces prevailed overlooking the BS and in December, the court officially ruled against WBA and then threw the case out of court. Astonishly the bearish articles on Seeking Alpha and other sites just suddenly disappeared as well which looked like the shorters exited their bear positions and stopped paying for the bear promotions.

In the months that followed, Transocean stock has consistently been going up just following its natural course since the company is doing so well and the price of oil has been going up as well. What a way to end 2020 and start 2021.

&#x200B;

[RIG](https://preview.redd.it/eghbkjl3nzp61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84565866abc86314337836e1206d4000161a934)

**Industry and Company Background:**

Without going into too much detail on who Transocean is and how they do business since most of that you can find that yourself on Google, but the abstract is Transocean is in the business of providing offshore oil drilling services for oil companies. Like most energy companies, they got hit pretty hard during the pandemic with oil falling to new lows due to Covid-19 lockdown measures and general overall fall in demand.

As a result, almost all of Transocean's direct competitors have filed for bankruptcy so Transocean remains the 800 pound gorilla with currently the largest, newest, and most efficient fleet to service the offshore oil drilling industry. But unlike their competitors, Transocean's territory exposure is global so they are not concentrated on only one geographic location (eg. Gulf coast) and most importantly RIG has a $7.8 Billion work backlog with a 75% penalty for any cancellations (none of their competitors are in the same position). What this means is that RIG has currently more work then they can handle if any of their oil clients were to cancel their contract, the client would have to pay Transocean the cash penalty of 75% of the project's value to Transocean. This is why even with very little new contracts in middle 2020, the company still had a steady revenue stream until more new contracts showed up and were added into their backlog later in the year.

Of course in early 2021 the demand for oil accelerated and Transocean is winning more new contracts around the world. Some analysts argue that some of the new contract day rates were lower as compared to before but if you look more closely at the trend of their day rates of the contracts, they are consistently rising over the past few months. So they probably gave some discounts in the initial recovery to build up their contract momentum which is expected and seems to be working.

With the up-trending price recovery of oil for the past months due to Biden's tough stance on American oil companies affecting supply, OPEC+ continuing tightening of supply, and a continuous rise in demand for oil due to economies reopening around the world results in continuous price increases with many high profile analysts even expecting $100 a barrel by the end of the year.

Out of that rise, offshore oil is still heavily demanded by oil companies. The reason for this is that offshore oil is extremely predictable as compared to other drilling methods when it comes to how much oil is in the well, the price to pull it out, and volumes on how much the company can consistently pull out. Like every major corporation, large oil corporations have to diversify their oil portfolios so that is why there will always be new contracts for offshore drilling of oil.

Compared to shale fracking which is what most oil companies employ in the US, offshore oil is significantly cheaper and less volatile in cost and is less affected by regulations since there are offshore wells around the world with the most increase in South America and Norway in the past couple of months. The biggest problem with offshore oil drilling is that offshore wells take years to develop, this is why oil companies were still signing new contracts with Transocean in 2020 when oil prices were relatively low since they know it would pay off in the long run and who knows what the price of oil will be when the well is operational in 1-3 years.

From a fundamental standpoint, Transocean is in a good position. It has enough cash to last years on top of their loan revolvers which they have not tapped. As per Yahoo finance, RIG's Book Value per share is $18.58 per share, well above the current stock price. Competitively, they are also in a great position as some of their competitors coming out of bankruptcy have low cash balances and lack of loan revolvers available to expand or develop their fleets.

The biggest problem with the competitors coming out of bankruptcy which Transocean highlighted in one of their recent earnings calls is that it scares the clients, since the clients will be signing contracts that would last years, they would prefer to work with companies that offer more reliability and stability, and as mentioned Transocean is the only one. RIG's management is second to none, they kept their shareholders' interests a priority and even refused to do a reverse split when their stock was under $1 and consistently focused on reducing their debt levels and to take advantage of market opportunities. New contracts are consistently flowing in, business is getting better and that is why RIG has been gradually going back up over the past couple of months and supported as well by the continuous rise of oil.

**Recently - New Play:**

A couple of weeks ago ago, I started to notice a steady climb in shorted shares and also spikes in volume of bond swaps as per my Bloomberg terminal. There were also large spikes of large batches of Put options contracts purchased at mid day (They didn't even try to hide it). At first I thought it was because of the price of oil going back down due to lockdown measures which part of it was but after building several models analyzing and comparing past oil price decline, the results didn't match up. When oil pricing started to go back last week due to the Suez Canal being blocked, it confirmed my theory as there was a rise in bear positions but it wasn't primarily because of the fall in oil prices.

My research did conclude that someone big was starting to short the stock again. And then late last week, I discovered that White Box Advisors just refiled their suit against Transocean again in Appeals Court claiming this time that the Judge who ruled against them ""used a legal standard that wasn't applicable."" Some legal and industry analysts have already examined the appeal and agree the appeal is BS. Could it be a coincidence that spiking short positions on Transocean and WBA's involvement conveniently looked like the appeal was announced after a hedge fund secured those bear positions and it worked because when the news came out Transocean stock started to go down again. What a play.

The goal of this post is to create awareness and showcase the manipulation by hedge funds. Time and time again hedge funds have employed the same strategies to try to beat good companies down for their own profit and there is no indication that their practice is pulling back. If the hedge fund who shorted Transocean is the same one from back in 2020 and attempts to use the same strategy to try to push Transocean stock down, we should start to see an uprising in bear articles against Transocean soon especially highlighting the appeal and different bear articles especially from Seeking Alpha repeating the same bear content from different third-tier writers since this as we know is in the hedgies arsenal even against GME and AMC stock.

This time around it is going to be harder for that hedge fund to do it on RIG for the simple fact that oil prices will start to go up since economies are opening around that world and systematic risk is now playing against them. Only time will tell what happens next, all I know is I can't wait to see the next official Short interest report for Transocean and perhaps a good bullish opportunity is in sights.

3rd. I worked for TSF on a rig, I know them, love them, a great company, clever and a market leader.

4th. Do not forget, they took the beating in the oil collapse in 2016 and the oil and gas industry actually never recovered from that. Then COVID, then this manipulation going on behind the curtains, they fight politicans, corruption and whatever destructive forces is out there and they still survive.

YES, RIG is here to stay and for any individual or any company to break down a company that provides for thousands of families and 100,s of thousands of families from the spin off effect, should just take 3 minutes to think about the hardship they create purely because they cannot accept the fact that they were wrong, they should have believed and rather supported a great company like RIG.

The key here is that you believe BB will be going up in the next 6 months. If you don't think that and don't buy the other posted DD's then don't bother with my strategy.

My theory is that the stock will be back over 10$ a share in the next month or so. I'm willing to buy a 1000 shares at this price. Instead of just buying them for 9.6 this morning, I sold 10 CSP (Cash Secured Puts) for $950 that expire on 4/1. This means if the stock is less than 10$ at market close Thursday, I'll be buying 1000 shares for 10k.

If I wanted to be really safe, that'd put my cost basis at $9.05 a share. But this is WSB and I want to play earnings so fuck that. I immediately used my $950 cash to buy some FD's. 19x 4/1 10C.

**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**

Huge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**

**TLDR:**

Amyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs

***The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***

**MY POSITIONS:**

I believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.

[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)

**BACKGROUND:**

I was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term

**$AMRS BUSINESS:**

This business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)

$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model

In the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)

In the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021).

$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**

**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**

No doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon

**SHORT INTEREST:**

As shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock

**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**

Beginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**

The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**

Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:

[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)

The CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)

To those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the ""efficient market"" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers

**CONCLUSION:**

These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more

Here's why:

   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

This dildo is now in your asshole. You’ve been eating lots of tendies recently and you need to take an epic shit.  If you don’t do something about this Empire State Building size dildo in your ass you might have problems.

https://istheshipstillstuck.com

Never mind it’s free!!! Go to edits unless you want some funny 

1. The media story of a gust of wind is a factor but something f'd up big. 

2. Ship was going 13 knots, when usually ships go around 8 knots. Whatever happened, happened quick and hard.

3. Look at the red paint at the bottom of the ship at the bow- that should be underwater. Just think about how much weight just was raised by about a one story house. There are 20,000 of those big containers on the ship. 

4. Let’s talk about tides, for the apes who live in trees.  This planet we live on has “tides”, because it spins commonly called day and night. Tides are caused by the moon. The moon is one out of two really big things we see in the sky. It’s also where rocket ships live. 

Everyday the tide goes up and down, twice to be exact. but if you look day to day, high tides get higher, then peak, then come back down again, just like your bank account. The peak happens on March 31 and again two weeks later.  This peak is also special( but not like you), it’s called a spring tide. The water level will be the highest it will be until April 25th. The 31st is the best chance of getting her off. (That’s what she said)

https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Suez-Egypt/tides/latest

5. Potential for an even bigger fuck up is not unthinkable.  To build these huge ships they make them just able the handle rough seas. Since the ship is aground front and back though they are going to need to pull one or both ends out kinda sideways. It was not built to deal with much ""hogging"" where the ship bends sideways into a u shape. Could snap like a twig, ergo oil spill distaster, plus huge hit on trade.  

So, you’ve eaten at Taco Bell, you understand.  This is a problem, you are starting to sweat, but it’s not a disaster yet. How do we fix this ass problem: Dig her out, pull her out, or float her.

I think we’ve all seen that poor crane, one bulldozer and 4 dudes trying their best, but something tells me this might not be the answer.  It can help, and what I hope happens is that dredging can help, but I know nothing on the topic.

Some basic maths: let’s say one third of the ship is aground. The Least Fucks Ever Given weighs about 200,000 metric tons.  This is a friction problem.  You need 50% of the weight that is aground to pull her off, that’s around 30,000 tons of force. Another ship, the Far Samson, is the most powerful tug boat in the world and can pull 420(woot woot) tons.   You would need more than 15 of these but there is only one. 

Siapem 3000 to the rescue?  Another way to fix this is to make the ship lighter, they are already doing this, ballast is being removed and fuel is being taken out, but the best way to make her float is to take off the containers.  This is not easy to do, because the ship is so tall. There are only a few crane ships that can off load containers 40 meters up.  One of these the Saipem 3000 is in the Red Sea and in transit.

So Saipem 3000, I hope you get the Ever Given so high that you literally save the global economy. 

Cheers to all of those working the problem! Thanks to all the merchant sailors out there, you are our only hope!

P.S. hope you are having a good day!

Edit: so the DD play here is, if it’s not out by the 31st buy gold and oil, and short everything, because if its there for a few weeks, it’s going to be real bad for global trade. Chip shortage, you can’t get a 2021 car right now, metals, vaccines, ppe, etc.  anything that goes between Asia and the EU.  The US won’t feel it at first bc not a lot of our trade goes through Suez but we’ll feel the hit eventually.

Edit 2: if you look at my name I usually go by Nat. One of you kind folks brought to my attention NAT. They ship oil. Are the stars aligning?

Edit 3: THEY MOVED IT 30 YARDS! YAY! Just to be clear I’m kinda rooting for the “they get it out” and we all don’t have a global crisis scenario. So DD might not apply.

Edit 4: Just as I’m going to sleep, I hear that Ever Given has been refloated! The dildo isn’t out yet, but we’re good and lubed.  Fuck that Taco Bell we’re going to have some fun! Tomorrow might be messy but I’m taking this as a good sign. May the tendies flow. Have a good night!

Edit 5: Well if you are still here, thanks, The story so far is this. I(the world) went to sleep last night with a mammoth dildo In my ass.  As I wake up, I find some mysterious hero has jiggled it out as I was sleep.   Whoever you are I want to thank you!

Edit 6: if you know anyone who helped or know how to get in touch with one m, please send this song to them from me! [Whoever You Are, Geggy Tah](https://luakabop.bandcamp.com/track/whoever-you-are) It’s an early 2000’s song. For those of you too young to understand all this butt talk it’s a pretty cool song. For those older, remember when car commercials didn’t suck so bad?

Edit 7: New DD....buy GameStop, AMC, and weed

mfi5s2,,wallstreetbets,post,1616994201,"MRE may be an absolute bargain stockDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I do not certify any of the information presented is accurate. I am not a professional or financial advisor of any form.

Martinrea International is a stock that designs, develops and manufactures automotive parts. With the pandemic unwinding, demand for vehicles is likely to go up in the future, and this could spur demand for automotive manufacturing. This is on top of the fact the stock appears to be undervalued at current levels.

The stock is a major bargain at the moment, trading at just $12.54CAD, while analysts give price targets of $17.00, an average of $18.94 and a high of $22.00. If any of the analysts currently looking at the stock are correct, the stock is poised for a gain of 35-76%. The stock recently suffered a poor Q4 result, which was followed by quite a large dip. They suffered a 12% decrease in profit even though their sales grew. However, it was noted that if you take adjusted profit that excludes most one time items, profits actually grew by 31%. Effectively the market may be underestimating the value of MRE.

In terms of statistics, the stock has a P/S ratio of 0.3 and a P/B ratio of 0.86. MRE is currently trading even below its book value. This compares favourably to competitors like Magna International, which has a P/S of 1.01 and a P/B of 2.89 or Linamar which has a P/S of 0.83 and a P/B of 1.12.

From a technical perspective, the stock is quite solid. The daily price has just formed a tweezer bottom pattern, suggesting the stock is likely to move upwards. Moreover, the stock is sitting right above a major trendline that has been touched 4-6 times in the past. Thus it could be predicted that the stock will bounce off this trendline once again. Third, the most recent peak sits at a price level of around $12.20, so if the other support levels were to fail, this would likely pose another support level for the stock. Finally, the 14 day RSI currently sits at 30.26. This is the lowest RSI since the start of the pandemic and could be indicative of an oversold condition. This could provide additional evidence for a reversal in trend in the near future. Each time when the stock moves from peak to trough it appears to take approximately 2-4 months. If this trend continues, this could potentially be the time horizon in which to anticipate the stock returning from a bottom to a top in the future, although this is an assumption that will not necessarily hold true.

&#x200B;

[Chart of MRE stock price. Recent peak that presents resistance is circled. RSI value that is the lowest since the pandemic start is circled in the purple pane. Tweezer bottom at current price is circled, although not readily visible unless you zoom in.

A relatively safe play might be to wait for reasonable confirmation of a reversal in the stock price and to take a conservative sell target at the most recent high, which was at about 16.21. If one were to buy at the current closing price and sell at that high, this would represent a gain of about 29.3% with an expected time horizon of approximately 2-4 months. However, it is possible the stock will exceed that level based on analyst estimates.

TLDR; MRE appears to be an undervalued stock ripe for a reversal in the future. Potential gains may exceed 30% based on analyst estimates and technical analysis. The anticipated time horizon for the trade is approximately 2-4 months based on previous movements in the stock's price.

mfuvgh,,wallstreetbets,post,1617039394,"Canadian LPs WILL be allowed in the US markets *WHEN* MSOs are allowed to uplist. $APHA/TLRY 🚀🚀🚀I **truly** don't understand how this concept is so difficult for most investors (""MSO gAnG"" in particular) to understand, but I'll make this nice and easy for you. 

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money from purchasing portions or entire publicly listed companies.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. 🤷

mfl88p,,wallstreetbets,post,1617008164,"TIGR Undervalued and crushing performance both at home and internationally.Currently sat at $14.47 I believe $TIGR is one of the most undervalued stonks around and is only being held down due to uncertainty in Chinese companies.

The earnings report recently contributed the following information. 

Operating and financial metrics saw a huge boost due to retention and expansion of clients. Total revenue increased by 2.4 x to 47.2m

Non-GAAP net income was $10.3 million in the fourth quarter, nearly 30 times the non-GAAP net income in the same quarter last year. 

Tigr added 44,000 new funded accounts this quarter nearly quadruple the number from the same period last year. 

Total funded accounts reached 259,000 by the end of 2020 more than double that of 2019. Growth in client assets was outstanding.

Total account balance reached $16 billion more than triple that of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 46.2% higher than the third quarter of 2020. 

Overall, for 2020, total revenue was $138 million more than double versus 2019. 

TIGR were profitable for the first time on a yearly basis.
 
Non-GAAP net income was $22.3 million in 2020, a big improvement from a non-GAAP loss of $1.8 million in 2019.

International clients represented 40% of newly funded accounts. TIGR expect that in 2021 to add more than 350,000 funded accounts. International clients will comprise more than 50% of the new funded accounts. 

The growth and adoption of TIGR's ESOP system accelerated as they added 35 clients in the fourth quarter for a cumulative total of 124 clients. 

It is expected their ESOP system will maintain its leading position and foresee further increases in market share

In July of 2019 TIGR  acquired Marsco, a U.S. broker dealer with over 30 years of self clearing experience. They also acquired their clearing licenses. 

The investment to transition to self-clearing remains a key milestone in the firm's development.

They now have the technological and operational prowess to control every aspect of the brokerage system from the front end to the back end.

The percentage of clients having their U.S. cash equities trades, self-cleared by Marsco, continued to increase and at the end of the fourth quarter reached over 20%.

In addition, Marsco is conducting clearing for all new clients on-boarding in the U.S. 

In February 2021, TIGR in total issued $65 million of convertible bonds. 

This capital will accelerate  international expansion, as well as support further investments in  research and development 

Total revenues were $47.2 million this quarter, increased 137% from the same quarter of last year. The increase was due to bigger user base 

Within the total revenue, commission increased 245% from last year to reach $25.2 million. Interest-related income, which combines financial service fee and interest income, was $13.3 million, an increase of 53% from last year.

Other revenue, mostly revenue from investment banking business, increased 118% from last year to $8.7 million.

Interest expense increased to $4.3 million from $1.5 million last year as we have more consolidated account customers. Net revenue after interest expense was $43 million, an increase of 135% from the same quarter last year. 

Non-GAAP net income, which excludes share-based compensation, was $10.3 million this quarter, 30 times the non-GAAP net income in the same quarter of last year. 

TLDR: TIGR crushed earnings crushed growth looks set to do it again next year and is seriously undervalued and even took a lovely dip down to 14.50 last week based on uncertainty in the market over Chinese companies listed on the NYSE.

I believe his company today should be worth between 22-24 and could easily grow to the 50's based on its international potential and expected future growth

mf8qv7,,wallstreetbets,post,1616961958,"Let’s Talk About “Market Makers” 

Let’s Talk About “Market Makers”

Getting Straight to the point.

There are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a “Market Maker”.

However each license does not make you a market maker.

There are three different types of license holders:

\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs),

\-Floor brokers

\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)

1.) The DMMs, formerly known as “specialists,” act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.

2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.

3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE’s goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.

Example of DMM Role:

On the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.

Each of the counters is a DMM’s post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs’ posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.

Important: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.

Example of DMM Role:

Your clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM’s post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM’s post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer’s representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to “work” the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM’s post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM’s bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 × 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.

For a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM’s post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the “crowd.” In such cases, the DMM’s responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM’s post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution.","['WMT', 'NDAQ']"

mfouy7,,wallstreetbets,post,1617022165,"Alexion ($ALXN): Opportunity to buy AstraZeneca ($AZN) at a discount (quick & dirty DD)Alexion Pharmaceuticals ($ALXN) is being acquired by AstraZeneca ($AZN). The cash and stock deal was announced on December 12th, 2020 

(see AZN's release: [https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-to-acquire-alexion.html)).

Here are the most important sections, about the price paid to ALXN shareholders and about the closing:

 *""****Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares*** *(ADSs) (each ADS representing one-half of one (1/2) ordinary share of AstraZeneca, as evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs))* ***for each Alexion share****. Based on AstraZeneca's reference average ADR price of $54.14, this implies total consideration to Alexion shareholders of $39bn or $175 per share.""*

*"" Subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed acquisition,* ***the companies expect the acquisition to close in Q3 2021.*** *""*

&#x200B;

Based on recent changes in relative prices, those who may be interested in buying AZN shares could acquire them at a discount via ALXN. 

Today's pre-market prices: AZN ADR $50,63 / ALXN $154,88

If the deal goes through (which is not a certainty at this stage; although I am no expert in regulatory aspects it seems unlikely to me that the deal might be blocked), the offer of AZN would value ALXN at $167.55/share ($60 + 2.1243 x $50.63), which is $12.67 (or 8.2%) above ALXN's current price. 

So, if you consider buying AZN, you may opt for the ALXN route which would give you a better entry price and some downside protection (discount + cash component of the offer). 

&#x200B;

Of course, this is also an opportunity for arbitrageurs (Buy ALXN, short AZN) for those who are into that kind of strategies. The exchange ratio would require to be rounded (e.g., at 2.124x, you could trade multiples of 250; at 2.125x multiples of 8). Do not forget to include transaction costs and borrow rates in the equation.

mfuz84,,wallstreetbets,post,1617039666,"Biocryst ($BCRX) continues to remain undervaluedFirst off, I am not giving you advice. I'm not a financial advisor, nor do I work in the pharma industry. I'm just sharing some research I did, and I'm open to all feedback and comments. Additionally (in full disclosure) based on what I found, I'm holding 450 shares because I'm still afraid of options.

Lets start off with some TLDR for the bullish thoughts and bearish thoughts.

Bullish points:

Based on fairly conservative COGS I have a share target of $19, but if that turns out to be overly conservative a more realistic value could easily push the share target to $24-$30. These values also assume fairly conservative adoption among the patient pool. The recent injection of liquidity also gives them plenty of runway to start cashing in on a fully approved drug (Orladeyo). Additionally none of this accounts for their developmental drug (BCX9930) at all which [has been racking up some big wins in clinical trials fairly recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and could push this to another level entirely. Considering that their Orladeyo drug on its own would support nearly double the current share price this makes a 10$ entry point fairly attractive with a potential bonus moonshot if BCX9930 takes off.

Bearish points:

Despite being approved, the rate of adoption of Orladeyo could take years to secure my estimated market share (I cant find any data to help estimate adoption rates). Drug trials can be a shot in the dark, and while currently there is no bad news regarding their up and coming drug BCX9930, a bad result would certainly draw enough negative sentiment to tank the price, despite Orladeyo easily supporting a share price of 19$ on its own. Additionally BCX9930 will need to complete trials for all of the numerous diseases they plan to market it for. Those trials will cost time and money and drag out for years. Lastly drug prices are in the focus of media pressure in the US which could likely have a negative impact on the pharma industry as a whole.

Now for the details. I'm going to talk through Liquidity, Revenue estimates, Cost estimates, and eventually arrive at my price target estimates. Lastly I'll speculate on some risks.

* Liquidity: In the 3rd quarter, they lost around 45M and had around 150M cash.  In Dec., they secured an additional 325M in liquidity (200M as a line of credit, and 125M as a 1-time gain which results in them paying a royalty on Orladeyo).  They have plenty of liquidity.  
* Revenue:  they have 2 drugs that I consider material.  Orladeyo which was approved in US and Japan, and is about to be approved in Europe.  BCX9930 which is far from approval in all but 1 disease in the US.    

   * Orladeyo is the only oral treatment for a rare disease known as HAE.  
   * Orladeyo will likely be sold for around 300000 per patient per year.  Biocryst set a price for sales in US of 485000, and will likely be sold for less in Europe, but I figure it averages 300000.  This price might sound obscene but is actually cheaper then its competition Takhzyro and Haegarda, which cost over 500000 per year.  
   * Orladeyo was actually only 30-44% effective in reducing HAE attacks, whereas Takhzyro and Haegarda are both around 80% effective.  However, Orladeyo is the only oral medication while Takhzyro and Haegarda both require injections.  The keys to Orledeyo are that it is a much more convenient and less invasive treatment, and despite its seemingly low effectiveness, it turns out that 50% of patients had a 70% reduction in attacks (while the other 50% probably saw little or no benefit, averaging to 30-44%).  
   * Also, in Biocryst's 3rd quarter conference call, management discussed a survey that they conducted, and found that about half of patients receiving injection treatments would consider switching to Orladeyo.  Since Orladeyo is effective in half of patients, and half of patients would consider switching, I conclude that Orladeyo could likely secure roughly a 25% market share
   * There are 7500 patients in US and 6500 in Europe.  If I conservatively assume 20% market share, their revenue would be .2\*14000\*300000=840M.  FYI, their guidance is ""north of 500M"".  
   * For sales in Japan, Biocryst made a deal with a pharma company called Torii.  Torii will sell Orladeyo in Japan and pay a royalty to Biocryst of between 20-40%, which will amount to around 15M in royalty revenue for Biocryst.  
* Costs  

   * After looking at various income statements, it looks like cost-of-goods-sold is generally 15-33% in the pharma industry.  I'll conservatively assume 33% for Orladeyo.  Gross profit is 840M\*.67 + 15M royalties=575M
   * In the [4th quarter](https://ir.biocryst.com/node/22286/pdf) they had 605000 in product sales (100000 was Orladeyo).  COGS was only 33000.  It's unclear how much of this COGS is attributable to Orladeyo or how much noise there is due to revenue still being so small, but 33000/605000 implies a COGS of just 5.5%.  This leads me to think my 33% assumption may be high.  If COGS turns out to be 25%, then gross profit would be 645M.   If COGS turns out to be 16%, then gross profit would be 715M.  I can't imagine COGS being any lower (otherwise the drug wouldn't cost 485000).  
   * As a result of securing additional liquidity, Biocryst will pay a royalty of 8.75% on the first 350M of sales, then 2.75% on sales between 350M and 550M, then 0 thereafter.  This amounts to a maximum annual royalty expense of 350\*8.75% + 200\*2.75% = 36M
   * SG&A + R&D + interest expenses were 50M in 3rd quarter, and increased to 62M in the 4th quarter.  They said they had infrastructure set up to market/distribute Orladeyo so I imagine SG&A won't increase much, but R&D will likely increase to fund further research of BCX9930 as well as other drugs.  I'll assume these expenses rise to 75M per quarter, or 300M annually.  
* Based on these assumptions that leaves profit of 575M - 36M - 300M = 239M.  Again, COGS is a major unknown in my model, but profit could be as large as 309M (in my 25% scenario) or 379M (in my 16% scenario)
* Share count was 176M in 3rd quarter, and increased from 110M last year.  I'll assume risk of further dilution to 200M.  
* EPS is 239/200=1.19.  I estimate a $19 share price based on P/E of 16 and COGS of 33% (This improves to $24 and $30 share prices in my 25% or 16% COGS scenarios respectively, both of which are more realistic than a conservative 33%).  **This is** ***before*** **considering the BC.0X9930 drug, which actually seems to be their primary asset.**  I did not see any revenue estimates for BCX9930.  But lets look at what we do know:  

   * 9930 is already close to approval to treat PNH in the US (here is some great [DD thats focused more on this new drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from [u/BIO9999](https://www.reddit.com/user/BIO9999/)), but there would only be around 300 patients in the US.  I found a presentation on Biocryst's [IR page](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) that listed other diseases that 9930 could treat, and I googled the prevalence of each in the US:   

      * aHUS - 600
      * ANCA vasculitis - 6000
      * Lupus nephritis - 12000
      * IgAN vasculitis - 66000
      * glomerulonephritis - inconclusive
      * primary membranous nephropathy - 3000
      * IgA nephropathy - 7500
   * It's unclear how many of these patients would need treatment with 9930 or what the price of 9930 would be, but there seems to be a **huge opportunity for 9930 to easily double my revenue/profit forecasts**.  This revenue is many years and many clinical trials away though, and may eventually face competition from other drugs, so I didn't include it in my analysis.  
* Risks:  (1) I did not consider corporate tax on their profit (though they probably won't pay much tax due to years of losses to carry forward).  (2) I've seen politicians tweet about obscene drug prices, and the bad press/political pressure may cause price reductions and instantly hurt the share price.  (3) According to Seeking Alpha, analyst consensus revenue estimates are only 56.8M in 2021 and 144M in 2022 (as opposed to my long-term estimate of 855M).  It seems it might be some time before they reach my revenue targets.  
* Again, I'm not that familiar with the pharma industry so I'm not really sure what will happen with COGS, R&D, or SG&A, but I tried to be conservative.  I never thought I would consider a pharma stock, but this really looks good around 10.  Thoughts?

**Who is $VIAC?**

ViacomCBS Inc. is a global media and entertainment company. It includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS All Access, Pluto TV and Simon & Schuster and some others I've never heard from. Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services. Literally a quarter of this company is dominating the children's media market.

**Why the selloff?**

This is because all of a sudden firms like Goldman Sachs and The Wall Street Bank start force selling huge chunks of stocks in block trades before the market opened on Friday. This obviously led to huge volume trading in $VIAC of 211 million, it's normal rates are at about 35 million. Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices. Now this shows that the selling was not driven by a technical or fundamental reason, as seen on some financial front pages. For me this suggests that the company isn't broken - only the stock.

Why the hedgies sold? Some fund managers believe the fire sales indicate that a big hedge fund or family office was in trouble.

""Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos’s New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn’t returned."" -Someones in the shit in my opinion..

**Fundamentals**

Their total revenue has declined the last two years from 2019 27.8B to 2020 25.2B, but shall spike up again to 27.79B this year. In comparisons to another media giant $DISCA which is trading at 41.9 right now, but only has a revenue estimate of 11.87B this year and didn't look too good in its past years of 2020 with 10.6B and 2019 with 11.1B. Which in stock comparisons means that $VIAC should trade at around 80 and not 48.2.

I also think that this is a good long term investment as its platforms like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central who are dominating the children's media market, and I don't see why this should stop anytime soon. 

**TLDR: Im comparisons to one of its highs on 22. march at 100.16, it went down to brutal 48.09 and its therefore completely undervalued. As some hedgie is in the shit we are offered a delicious stock on a silver platter.**

I see some parallels between the smartphone revolution and the current ongoing connected vehicles revolution. There are mainly two approaches where software platforms can succeed. Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). 

Those that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of ""polished premium-ness"" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). 

The first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).

IVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart. As soon as IVY's adoption reaches a critical mass, the network effect will take off and IVY will become the industry-standard vehicle data platform.","['GOOGL', 'TSLA', 'AAPL']"

**So Schizo Friday started** when u/FI_not_RE posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/mdztz0/canoos_potential_partnership_with_rgbsi) about RGBSI hiring for different positions related to auto manufacturing specifically related to Canoo.  RGBSI is an engineering consulting agency which has helped manufacturers achieve goals with production lines and quality control among other things.  Looking at their website suggests they have experience in the arena that would benefit canoo to do small micro factories.

**How does the Rubber Meet the Road?**

Micro factories has been something that Tony has been harping on for ages.  /u/Planereflection of the Canoo Leak fame did some digging and found that Divergent 3D is in Torrance California and is headquartered [4 miles away.](https://u.teknik.io/JITxs.PNG)  I am sure many of the same employees frequent the same bathhouses and upvote each other’s FetLife profiles but their company is in line to deliver on the micro factory end.  /u/planereflection found [this linked in article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/philosophy-anti-gigafactory-kevin-czinger/) and also the Youtube video of Jay Leno driving their car.  It seems like their CEO and Tony would get a long and probably ran into each other at a trump rall… I mean football game.

So we took a break and /u/Basket_Fragrant discussed some of his TA, gave out some reading recommendations and weighed in on [Papa Manpreet’s views](https://twitter.com/manpreet_mba09/status/1375519164509478912?s=20) of the coming price action.  And things were pretty cool

But suddenly cn0110 busts in and says “Have you seen that Kia is dropping their EGMP reveal Tuesday?!?!!”.  **I swear to you loyal readers you have never seen such a schitzo reaction in the chat as to what followed.**  Literally worse than a thunderstorm around Arkham during the 4th of July people were pulling crazy shit out of their gluteal weeds and flinging it against the walls.   We were all getting so high on Hopium that Canoo was going to be responsible for Kia's entire EV platform and that we were going to announce IP in that vehicle and gain money per sale and that Q4 was so profitable Aquila will announce a dividend of 1000 dollars per share and strippers were going to deliver your Canoo on subscription and stick around to party.

This continued for some time until fan favorite /u/MisterInvicta boots down the door with a loop stick in one hand, weighted blanket in the other and proceeds to tard wrangle everyone to the ground with his sensible interjections of “Vehicles take years to develop Canoo and Hyundai have only been working together for a short time” and “Their electric skateboard design looks nothing like canoo’s”.  I swear it was like the orderly looked up from his newspaper at the asylum and said “God dammit not again”.

**But the real takeaway would be if Canoo would partner with Kia to build the skateboards and partner with Divergent 3d to do the custom Top Hats.**  This would be the big tiddy event.  In fact I am suspicious about the inability for people to own a “Sedan” like Canoo car this smells kind of like a “non-compete clause”.  This makes more sense than Magna which charged Fisker 6% of their company for just ONE VEHICLE and there is 0 ways that Tony would accept this and probably told Magna to get fucked so there is a pretty big hole here to fill where the manufacturing will come from.

Moreover, the partnership between Hyundai and Canoo will be under scrutiny at this earnings.  Fortunately in the updated S-1 there is a clause “""*The agreement provides for the co-development of a platform for a small segment electric vehicle for which the intellectual property developed will be jointly owned by us and Hyundai Motor Group. The agreement provides that it may be terminated for convenience by either party; however, certain provisions, including with respect to the joint-ownership of intellectual property, survive any such termination*.""  I am not sure which way this will fall but I can imagine that it is favorable to Canoo.

**So the 3/30 E-GMP reveal was dropped via news on 3/16.  This also correlates to the date that Canoo dropped its own earnings date on 3/29.  They both separately released news on the same day.  Think about that for a second.**

**Next Week we will go from Earnings to Kia E-GMP reveal to Biden Infrastructure plan which will hopefully discuss EV tax breaks especially for businesses.  We might be having a big week here guys.**

**TLDR** \- Canoo is in a partnership with hyundai/Kia to produce their E-GMP platform.  This IP basically allows a shared tech skateboard. **(not schitzo)** Kia could produce the skateboards for themselves and send the throwback trim to Canoo who utilizes micro factory tech to produce customizable Top Hats provided by Divergent 3D whose CEO said the same thing that Tony said regarding additive manufacturing techniques at scale. **(this is the Schizto Part)**  There are jobs that were recently posted to the internet by RGBSI that would fit with a micro factory approach. **(Not Schitzo)**  BB provides the sensors and software integration to the finished product. **(Not Schitzo)** Tony scheduled earnings right before Kia revealed to the world a working car that his company participated in so he can discuss it. They both dropped the news at the same time.  **(Not Schitzo)**

**None of this is priced in and when it is will make everyone rich as fuck. Then tony says they are working with Uber for subscription model or Walmart Orders for MPDV  and I get to shitpost from Jupiter.**

**P.S** \- Given the current situation with Goldman Sachs block orders there might be a sense of delayed covering of short positions.  This coupled with the futures spiking rather green on Friday and all the above mentioned news.  We could see a really good week ahead.

**P.S.S** there are some more articles being written by the great minds as we speak. I will link them here when they are up.

**Edit 1** \- Canoo Has Bantz! they just dropped a video of the truck driving on their Instagram and called it ""Coming in hot"",  Ride Bros where the flames Ride Bros? where's the flames?

With strong financial performance, and a increase in net profits. It's likely the earning report will go well despite covid.

mfr3t8,,wallstreetbets,post,1617029134,"$YETI Trade IdeaTrade: $YETI 7 MAY $67 Calls from present till 28 April

Thesis:$YETI bottomed out its Implied Volatility cycle and is running sideways on a rollercoaster. I'm 'Rooish on the stock. As implied volatility increases up to the peak of the cycle it will drive up the Extrinsic Value of the Calls. Meanwhile the Intrinsic Value of the calls will increase during the upswings of the rollercoaster

There is an opportunity to maximize profit by converging these two forces, selling on the upswing of intrinsic and extrinsic value which should occur roughly around 28 April.

Price target on 7 May (Strike): $70 but it doesnt matter

How did I arrive at this number? I drew lines on a chart with my fingers and guesstimated. So its fake and means nothing. It’s also the average price of the rollercoaster IMO, I think the coaster is shrinking but should at least average to $70.

Price target on 28 April (profit day): $67.27-73.86

Am I allowed to offer a range as a price target? I don’t know.

The $67.27 is where I believe the implied volatility cycle peaks and intersects with the bottoming out of the rollercoaster, which is the worst case outcome, low intrinsic as extrinsic maxes, but you take a profit mostly of the extrinsic and a very small gain in intrinsic.

The $73.86 is the peak of the coaster around the implied volatility and peak. intrinsic to the tits. extrinsic pretty damn high.

Why do I think it plays out this way? The Greeks and The Underlying -

Greeks: Delta 0.7 Theta (0.0544) Vega 0.0841 - I fully believe the implied volatility will increase from about .53 to .8 driving the extrinsic up by about $2 over the next 30 days, hedging the $1.63 theta decay.

Breakeven on implied volatility gains against the theta decay is an increase of implied volatility by .19 to .72. Also, I’m anticipating exiting the position early negating the last bit of Theta Decay. Basically, sell on the upswing closest to 28 APR.

The Underlying:

Earnings: projected earnings to occur 6 May, meaning I expect the implied volatility cycle to increase to peak or near-peak by 28 April, just a bit before earnings

Earnings outlook: $YETI is strapped with cash and just expanded further in the consumer space to bags. Anecdotally I feel its the case that YETI has an unusually high attach rate for the space its in. I think people will think YETI is reporting favorable earnings, driving the price up on its way to earnings.

mf3mog,,wallstreetbets,post,1616947218,"Why Cannabis Legalization is BEARISH for some MSOs and BULLISH AF for LPs like $APHA/$TLRY 🚀🚀🚀This weekend New York legislators finally agreed on all details of their marijuana legalization bill, and expect it to be voted on in the coming days. It is GREAT news for LPs, and pretty worrying for retail dependant MSOs like Trulieve, but great news for wholesale based MSOs like Cresco or 4 Front. 

[Article about NY weed from our favorite shills, CNBC](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1262266) 

The interesting part of NY's bill is that they are implementing a TIERED system. Meaning MSOs will **NOT** be allowed to create an oligarchy like they are accustomed to and rely upon. Some companies will be grandfathered in, but even those grandfathered will come with some pretty shitty limitations on expansion. LPs entering the market later will be in a better position than grandfathered MSOs, by multiples. 

It is also interesting that New York believes that their model will be the ideal national model. That would have some massive consequences for MSOs. 

>""When this bill becomes law, New York will be poised to implement a nation-leading model for what marijuana legalization can look like.""

Considering Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is crafting his own federal marijuana bill for the Senate, there's every reason to believe we will see similarities between New York's bill and Schumer's bill. The intent here is clear, Democrats want to use the marijuana industry to create opportunities for minorities, and oligarchies do not create opportunities. MSOs are watching their precious business model crumble right before their eyes, and LPs are watching a marvelous industry open slowly with WIDE OPEN arms. A forced vertical integration is worst case scenario for LPs, but being allowed to ship their products into states like NY without having to own a retail store to do so, is the **best** case scenario. No retail commitments and very little infrastructure is the exact ""capital light model"" Curaleaf is using to tackle the EU market, and it's the same one ALL LPs will be using to enter the US. Curaleaf specifically says that their EU approach has ""tremendous financial benefits"" versus the US approach of vertical integration. 

Keep in mind companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf wouldn't be ""big"" without having the advantage of establishing oligarchies. Trulieve for example holds over 50% market share in Florida thanks to the overly restricted laws surrounding marijuana. There's absolutely no chance they will be able to hold a 50% market share in a open legal market. There's also no reason to expect they will even be successful at all once *any* competition is allowed in. They will be fighting at least 10x the amount of stores they currently compete with. They will be forced to compete via price and quality, for the first time. They are untested in both aspects. Anyone can sell weed when you're the only guy in town selling it, just ask a cartel how they sell brick weed. Lol. Your product quality doesn't matter if there's little to no competition. Also, it's not like either company has a ""secret sauce"" that makes them successful. They don't have brand loyalty like ""Cookies,"" and they haven't been proven in a competitive market like 4Front. They just sell weed in places where there's not much competition, that's it. 

Most MSO gang morons, I mean Investors, are stuck looking at the marijuana industry as it stands today. Last I checked, Investing is a **forward** looking thing. Today's marijuana Industry creates oligarchies, tomorrow's marijuana Industry creates opportunities. Companies, like Cresco or 4Front, who are wholesale focused are in the best position to take advantage of the thousands and thousands of new shelves that will opening with federal legalization. Companies like Trulieve and Curaleaf will have to reinvent their business model, and Trulieve might actually have to pay someone to create some logo artwork for them. 

Their current logo looks like a $5 package from Fiverr. Maybe upgrade to the $20 this time, Trulieve. Lmao.",['AMP']

So, quick backstory, Tiger Asia Management had to sell 30B of equities to meet a margin call. As a result, Discovery, Farfetch, a bunch of Chinese stocks, etc, all fell stupid amounts on Friday. FTCH is down 6% today as well as the fallout continues, but it's not based on any fundamentals

Looking at Tipranks, FTCH has an average analyst price target of 67 dollars. It's not a Chinese stock and it's not media, but it does have exposure to the global remergence following Coronavirus recovery. I think it's a great play and makes a lot of sense.

(A shallow comparison of them both.)BLUF: Both of these stocks are knee deep in the streaming wars. They both fell sharply last week due to a hedge fund liquidation. Read more about that in the link below. Over the past 5 days, DISCA fell 46%, and VIAC fell 51%. Both have a bullish sentiment, along with their pros and cons.

>[ViacomCBS, Discovery plunge due in part to forced liquidation of Archegos Capital positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html)

Below is a 3 month snapshot of both stocks, along with SPY just for comparison purposes.

[3 Month view of VIAC, DISCA, and SPY](https://preview.redd.it/8qhzft9xesp61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e655fb4a233038e41f0122327e3f763f9a3601)

Both VIAC and DISCA followed each other rather closely in terms of percentage gained. Even with the recent drop, had the stock been held, both would come out beating the market.

**Profile Overview:**

[VIAC is approx. 18&#37; larger than DISCA.](https://preview.redd.it/u0xhj70yesp61.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=5124890c20f75a651950f10fd820578eb93f8c50)

**Brands:**

[VIAC Brands](https://preview.redd.it/u38uz250fsp61.png?width=1978&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a68fe0ef84f167f1b5669b05ff34154bab14a61)

[DISCA Brands](https://preview.redd.it/stf1r1vzesp61.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e102639753862679e28b9db8619a821bf8c6248)

**Profitability:**

https://preview.redd.it/dmmkpgy3fsp61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a735ab5a2608ec4ba38c11429c06cd2d3e8cb47

DISCA comes out ahead here. They both have a rather decent profit margin, but DISCA has a whopping 24% advantage over VIAC.

**Momentum:**

https://preview.redd.it/lm5e6jq4fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e245da1875ed75731ddc6fed5d8a64aae9a3b25

Let's skip over the 1 month price performance, as this has been explained via the first link provided at the top.

DISCA comes out ahead in the less than 6 months, and the greater than 1 year price performance. Meanwhile, VIAC is the clear winner in the 9 month to 1 year price performance. Overall, both performed well recently, but DISCA has been consistently in the green.

**Income Statement:**

https://preview.redd.it/638r7ng5fsp61.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67ae40ae70845b7ba971bdc1c6699017eb8684d

VIAC's revenue is the clear winner here. They pull in more than double DISCA's revenue. They also come out ahead in every other faucet.

**Balance Sheet:**

https://preview.redd.it/t17gusa6fsp61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86a682e7a11bf08a3500f886aec5a323cc8c36b

Now, their balance sheets. Both have a nice chunk of cash on hand, which should give investors confidence. VIAC does hold more debt, however, they also recently announced that they are going to issue more shares, which should give them a boost of approx. $3B. DISCA, as of writing this and to my knowledge, has not released any statement concerning the issuance of more shares.

**Short Interest:**

[VIAC Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/2sdrhb27fsp61.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac8eac76c2537f90575b9a6719148d29550f919)

[DISCA Short Interest](https://preview.redd.it/h7oep358fsp61.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb55327034fa06f346ec3f6abbf9d23fe259ac3b)

[VIAC Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/VIAC/short-interest/) \- VIAC, as of 15 March, has 18.9%, a decrease of .5% since February 26th.

[DISCA Short Interest Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DISCA/short-interest/) \- DISCA, as of 15 March, has 29.7%, an increase of .6% since February 26th.

Overall, both of these companies have provided growth to their investors, even after the drastically sharp decline. With the recent decline of the NASDAQ over the past month, it's a bit of a toss-up on which one will be better in the long-term (imo that is.)

**Positions:** NONE in either of these companies. However, I am looking to buy into one of these two, after the market opens tomorrow.

EDIT:  Dividend (See Image Below) VIAC has a dividend, DISCA does not.

At this point with every streaming service taking back it's original content  you basically have On Demand TV.  It's no longer a one stop shop.

Also who has Shark Week?  Really if I am going to slug down cash for a service I'm picking the one that let's me watch show after show about sharks.  Fuck NCIS LA and Blue Bloods.",['DISCA']

mf3r7c,,wallstreetbets,post,1616947572,"QNX hypervisor will be in all future connected EVs (possibly including Tesla as self-driving and vehicle software becomes more regulated)Running multiple OS-es in a single vehicle is going to be a major trend forward (one for instrument clusters, one for infotainment, one for autonomous driving etc.), so hypervisors will be the most foundational software component for connected vehicles. This is why industry experts don't see connected vehicles as ""smartphones on wheels"", they see them as ""data centers on wheels"".

Blackberry's QNX hypervisor is currently the most widely-adopted virtualization platform (arguably the industry-standard) among vehicles that need to run multiple OS-es (instrument clusters: QNX,  infotainment: Automotive Grade Linux/Android Automotive/QNX/Windows Embedded Automotive/AliOS etc). 

The other commercial alternatives in the RTOS hypervisor space (OpenSynergy's COQOS, SysGO's PikeOS, Wind River's VxWorks hypervisor, Green Hills' INTEGRITY) did not find much success in the automotive industry, showing that Blackberry's QNX hypervisor indeed has some stickiness among automakers. In fact, the only 2 hypervisors that currently support VirtIO are QNX hypervisor and COQOS. VirtIO is the upcoming standard that makes the deployment of Android Automotive on vehicles easier by hosting them as virtual machines. 

In other words, if an automaker wants to use Android Automotive as their In-Vehicle Infotainment, the path of least resistance is to either use QNX hypervisors or COQOS because this way the automakers no longer have to implement the Hardware Abstraction Layer required for Android Automotive to work on bare-metal. Android Automotive will likely dominate the infotainment space due to its robust media apps development ecosystem and cross compatibility with the smartphone ecosystem. IVY will provide an interface for Android Automotive app developers to access vehicle sensor and localization data (possible monetization opportunity?). Any forward-looking automaker who wishes to compete with Tesla will definitely choose the Android Automotive + QNX hypervisor (+ Blackberry IVY possibly) stack. Recent examples include Volvo Polestar 2 and Ford. 

QNX also has the largest market share in the digital instrument clusters RTOS space currently. QNX uses a microkernel architecture so it is designed to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements which are essential for instrument clusters and vehicle control. Nobody wants to see their speedometer or brakes lagging behind or their digital dashboard crashing in the middle of the road because this poses safety risk. QNX is ISO 26262 ASIL-D certified, the highest possible safety rating for automotive RTOS. 

AGL is no match in this space due to its monolithic architecture that makes it difficult to guarantee functional safety and hard real-time requirements. Some automakers may choose to use AGL/Linux for now (eg. Tesla), but this is really an unsafe practice and should hopefully be regulated soon. I remember hearing [horror](https://insideevs.com/news/342908/tesla-autopilot-software-crash-while-driving-what-you-need-to-know/) [stories](https://youtu.be/OnJ0jPGmrmM) about Tesla's dashboard crashing and blacking out when the car is still moving on Autopilot on the freeway. Hopefully, as ADAS/self-driving becomes more mainstream, traffic authorities will make ISO 26262 ASIL-D safety certification a legal requirement for all connected vehicles.

On the security side, Blackberry's integration of Cylance into QNX will also be a key differentiator. As vehicles become more connected to the internet, hacking is inevitable and security will be a major requirement for all automakers. To see how scary it can be, see this [Jeep hack](https://youtu.be/MK0SrxBC1xs) video. Blackberry has a great track record in security and its security expertise is world leading, so this is another stickiness of QNX.","['ES', 'TSLA']"

mf5c1e,,wallstreetbets,post,1616952152,"$Root why I like this stock.$Root is a disruptive fintech in the insurance world. 

Traditional insurance uses different correlations to gauge riskiness of customers to determine pricing, with credit score being the biggest determinant but also gender, age, and make/model of the car.

$Root is using data driven telematics and proprietary pricing models to deliver fairer more accurate pricing to customers. Customers download an app on their phone and the phone tracks the user's driving behavior. Every 9 months the data collected allows $Root to reiterate their pricing models. Each reiteration will allow further cost reductions.

To highlight the effectiveness of using telematics in seasoned states with just one 9 month iteration of collecting data $ROOT was able to deliver a 15% improvement in their loss ratio. That is a substantial cost savings that will grow even further overtime with each reiteration. 

Thier IPO last year during a pandemic had some of the biggest tech names including snowflake investor Dragoneer at an IPO price of $27. 

During last year alone they were able to grow written premiums by 37%. Bigger insurance companies are increasingly adopting telematics. Right now companies like state farm use third parties to collect data and use it as an adjuvant to their traditional pricing models. Overtime though with data science using telematics is going disrupt the insurance industry pricing models. $Root in the future could offer SaaS to major insurance companies.

Bear Arguments.
Insurance is a nongrowth mature industry with big players to compete against. 
Covid-19- less people driving and nobody knows how driving behavior will be in the future with wfh.
Shorts are also not understanding the potential tech with telematics and how it could revolutionize insurance with fairer pricing and lead to SaaS to those who use driving info.
Root is a startup and is burning cash. Like most startups profitability will be an undeterminatable time away. Growth in written premiums is 37% over last year with a 17% reduction in loss ratio.

Short Squeeze Potential
Currently a lot of the shares outstanding are locked up until 4/26. 13 million float. 68-74% short interest.

Gamma Squeeze Potential.
Call Volume was over 40,000 on Friday for 4/16

Catalyst for short squeeze and potential price targets.
There is a lot of DD on here. If you type Root in the search bar and DD multiple posts come up in the past two months. Citron Research posted on Twitter Friday the potential for a short squeeze. Volume on Friday with citron posts was 3.5x the average.. This is really a wsb thing and looking at the DD on here it might be possible citron stole the idea from here. 

The insurance industry although mature is huge and Root could offer SaaS in the future to major insurance carriers. Most of the shorts probably entered at the 22 mark, the gamma ramp goes up to 40, I could see this from a short squeeze with the low float and the twitter pump going to 60+ by 4/16.

Positions: 2,000 shares 10 10c 4/16 10 7.5c 4/16 adding more tomorrow thinking 20c. 

Further readings: there's tons of DD on here if you look in the search bar. Also if you look up citron research on Twitter. Idk I think he stole the idea from us. Tendies should be ours.",['TWTR']

There is some fundamental analysis that could be discussed but I wanted to see what people thought about these points or any points I am missing for either case.

&#x200B;

In the bullish case:

\- Sports equipment: More demand in the spring to summer as people gather together more.

\- Guns and Ammo (Not to be politically spicy): ammo is scarce and they keep selling out

\- Existing Rising Revenue

\- 48% short interest on the float (compared to 44.6% on float for GME) as of March 15th

\- Lol people love to spend stimulus on hobbies

&#x200B;

In the bearish case:

\- Recent shootings could spook current investors with low sales after potential gun reform

\- Other online or retail competitors

\- Low volume can create massive price swings; may not have attention for a long time

\- Sports and leisure may not be priority with unemployment and inflation

&#x200B;

I am relatively new to everything but I want to hear outside opinions so as to not give any impression of confidence. I am not just looking for confirmation bias but for reasons why I would be wrong. I will see what other subreddits think too and compare responses. (Not a financial advisor)

Edit:

This is a rather new account so I cannot comment on anyone yet. That is a fair point that short interest does not necessarily mean a bullish case. I am not anticipating a squeeze but at some point shorts do have to cover even for their profit. I am also realizing that saying to take advantage of the gun craze after a tragedy is pretty bad. It would be also bad to not mention an important factor in price. Thank you.",

2. Price increases: Pitney's Presort Services can help businesses mitigate the higher prices.
3. Shorter post office hours with some closures: Mailers can use Pitney's Send Pro Online which is the best deal for $5 a month.
4. Addition/Repurposing of processing facilities to meet package demand: With more drop off points available, Pitney can further reduce its transportation costs for ingesting parcels into the postal network.

Over the last week and especially on Friday many companies: $BIDU, $IQ, $TME, $VIAC, $VIPS, $YY and many others faced lots of selling pressure from what is now being rumored to be forced liquidation of at least one highly leveraged hedge fund- Archegos Capital.

Some estimates I've heard are over 10B sold across the board.
