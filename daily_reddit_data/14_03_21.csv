m4rz5b,gqwajyw,stocks,comment,1615729382,Why the hell is there a daily meme stock thread on the weekends but for legitimate discussion we carry over from Friday?,
m4rz5b,gqwezb9,stocks,comment,1615732573,"Got my deposit and itching to play this weekend so grabbed DOGE at .054. Figure some stimmy checks will go into this, play it between .050 and .065. Going into GE Monday morning.",
m4rz5b,gqx4lyb,stocks,comment,1615744711,"I kind of feel like I might be better off investing in more stable long-term stocks, like DIS (which I believe will grow, as Disney is already huge and very likely to continue buying other companies like they bought Fox), TSLA, AAPL, 5G stocks (which will SUPPOSEDLY blow up this year or next year), etc.

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can’t fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it’s depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn’t ready to immediately move out so I could plan that better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I’m not sure that will happen. And supposedly Jack in the Box and Chili’s.

I’m also planning on investing in weed stocks as the US is legalizing marijuana, I support this (although don’t personally smoke, as I take medication that would have dangerous reactions like serotonin syndrome) and think it’s safe to say that these companies will blow up, and a lot of these stocks are only like $0.30 a share right now. Also mushroom and psychedelic stocks (microdosing is already legal).

If I made all that money from GME I could afford to invest in the short-term AND long-term, AND live it up RIGHT NOW, but I can’t go back in time, so trying to find the next play.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I’m not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I’m 25, I don’t want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I’m an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

I just want my independence and security, and I want it now, and, at least to some extent, kind of need it before the year is over.....

I just want to enjoy the game of Life. I don’t want kids, so that’s a responsibility I won’t have, but I would like to be with women (which is easier when not poor/broke)

That’s the best I can explain it.

I got banned from WallStreetBets for 5 days for mentioning a stock that is only worth $1, as I didn’t bother to read the side rules. I can’t mention it by name, but it’s only $1 a share, and some people believe it might be the next short squeeze, so I’m wondering if I should buy 500-1,000 or more shares of that.",

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
> “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
> “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
> # Growth vs. cyclicals
> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
> “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
> “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
> “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
> “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
> “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
> Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
> “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
> # Bond volatility
> There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
> The program expires March 31.
*****
> “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
> “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
> “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

> March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

> # Signs of Life in Europe?

> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

> While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

*****

> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

> We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

> # Versatile Outperformers

> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

m4zppr,,stocks,post,1615743393,"So there’s a bunch of guys I went to high school with. They were...pretty average students. I’m almost 100% sure none of them went to any kind of college.

But they’re recently peddling that they are all CEOs of their own investing companies. Every post is either of them engaged in some absurd level of wealth, or encouragement to join their team, or both.

Nothing adds up. The videos they share have the granularity of a Wikipedia article on “stocks” or “forex”. But they’re talking about driving Lamborghinis and buying $300k (ugly) watches. Humble-bragging about making $100k in a day on the markets. They also have official looking articles published about them as entrepreneurs that are just fluff pieces full of generic garbage-positive advice. And they post random pictures or tickers here and there with zero context to their 100k followers. I’m a relatively experienced investor and I really have no idea that they are going on about.

I think it’s a scam. Even if they did know what they were doing in the markets, why not focus on that and why put so much emphasis on displaying their wealth and getting others to join?  All they talk about is mentors. It has all the looks of trying to sell a lifestyle....all the actual millionaires I know wear $20 jeans and drive Honda’s and spend zero time bragging about how much they made or what their strategy is.

Is this some kind of scam? I’ve been looking but I can’t find any information about this, but I have friends that I care about that are looking to join. I just want to know what the point of this scam is so I can try to keep the ones I care about away from it.

I think you answered the question right there.

All of the truly wealthy people I know live a similar lifestyle. I’m fortunate to be friends with two different folks who are worth more than $300 million apiece. They both drive fifteen year old pickup trucks, buy $15 Wrangler jeans from Walmart, and have been wearing the same watches they got for high school graduation decades ago. These are the people from whom you should seek advice. Ignore the flash in the pan. It’s a scam.

m4zabk,,stocks,post,1615742166,"Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!

The market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. 

There are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.

The producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. 

Between Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. 

That said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price.

m4zo63,,stocks,post,1615743267,"I invested about $300 into AMD my freshman year at $2 and $4, respectively, and am now needing this money to meet tuition this semester. I will only be needing a few thousand. I have a few thousand in other stocks (I guess I have been lucky in my choices), but the bulk of my money is in AMD. I am not sure whether I should sell AMD, or these other holdings. If I should sell my other holdings, then I need to decide which ones. Basically I am financially illiterate and got lucky with the small amount of money I had.

I am wondering what I should do to become more financially literate so that I can make the best decisions regarding these stocks. I have not touched this account for over 7 years, and this is close to the most money I have ever had in any bank account (being a student whose account is drained each semester). I feel a heavy burden to get this right. I do not want to become an active investor, I am just at a point where I need to do a bit of activity.

If anyone has any readings they could recommend specifically on Ford or AMD, that would be very helpful. Some more general, introductory recommendations would be helpful too. I like to think of myself as a quick learner, so I wouldn't mind more intermediate or advanced texts either. This would help give me a greater picture of the depth of knowledge in the field as well.

1) How much you'll have to pay in taxes. If you're a student with no other income, this may be a good time to sell highly appreciated stock. This factor would favor selling AMD.

2) The balance of your portfolio based on current values. Conventional wisdom is to have a well-diversified portfolio, rather than having the bulk of your savings in one particular stock. Since the bulk of your money is currently in AMD, this factor would also favor selling AMD.

3) How you think the stocks you own will perform in the future. Kinda a crapshoot, so I think the above two factors outweigh this factor.

The cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for the past year. I am in Canada and the cash are sitting in a RRSP hence i did not transfer it into a interest bearing account because I wanted the cash to remain liquid in a event of a crash. I kept hoping the market would crash so I could buy back in cheaper and that has cost me 2 years of my salary in missed gains. Seeing these gigantic rallies every day I am getting serious FOMO but is also conflicted as buying back in now will be locking in my losses. I dont think I have the mental strength to hold on to all cash much longer and I know I shouldn't of tried to time the market in the first place but I feel I'm in too deep at this point. I feel like doing a lump sum and be done with it  so i can be free from my mental anguish but with markets at ATH i am still somewhat hesitant, I don't want to FOMO in at the top and see my holdings crash. Would DCA be a better option? 

100K of this money is actually for my parents' retirement. They will be retiring within 5-8 years. I sold their 2% MER mutual fund last year and wanted to buy back the ETF equivalent but because of my greediness I wanted to time the bottom and to buy in cheaper and the market just kept shooting up and i never bought in. The mutual fund allocation was 60/40 equity/fixed income and I was thinking to mirror that but seeing how much bonds are taking a beating and with potential further increases in interest in the near future I'm not sure if bonds are a good idea. I don't think I'm comfortable in going with an all equity allocation either due to my parent's short time horizon, can anyone suggest some alternatives?

I know i fucked up huge and probably shouldn't be doing DIY investing. But please, I am already feeling dead inside. Missing the greatest bull market in history will most likely haunt me for the remainder of my life.  I will never touch the holdings again once fully invested.

I did something similar except I sold before the crash - had a bad feeling before COVId. And didn’t buy back in until very recently. So I didn’t lose much but I also missed the upside because my Chase Private Client “pro” told me not to go back in last April. Not listening to anyone any more. 

I would do a well diversified ETF, like VOO. Even physiologically it is easier to let the money do it’s thing. 

I have about 25 years till retirement so that’s where bulk of my money sits. I also have some stocks/dividend plays in my ROTH but that’s maybe 10% of my total networth.

And even if it drops later this year or next, it will recover. 

I am a bit worried about your parents’ time horizon. 5 years is a bit too close for 100% equities... but I wouldn’t go into bonds either. So that’s a tough call and I myself don’t know what I would do. My child is 5 years away from college and I am not putting our 529 back into equities because I can’t afford to lose what I have there right now. But maybe your parent’s retirement is different if they can postpone it if things go sour. I don’t have that option with college.  That’s my big chunk in cash and it will remain in cash.",
m4yyvz,gqx1jts,stocks,comment,1615743632,"I have a few questions and some advice:

1. It took you 1 whole year and new ath's to get enough FOMO to put the money back into the market?

2. Why are you still trying to time the market if you already experienced that you can't?

3. Why are you investing your parents money if you are asking basic questions about investing to strangers on the internet?

I don't want to offend you, but it seems to me like you are so dead inside that you refuse to learn about your mistakes.


My advice:

1) Re-evaluate your risk tolerance. You should never get into a situation where you sell at the bottom of a crash, for any reason whatsoever. This includes considering not investing your parents money. It feels like you are already overwhelmed with investing your own money. Think about what it will do to your mental health if you fuck up your parents retirement. This should not be your burden to bear.

2) Set up a DCA plan for an assets that fits your risk tolerance. If it is an ETF, individual stocks or anything else purely depends on your risk tolerance. 

3) Stop worrying. It's only money. Being emotional about investing not only fucks you up in the long run, but also leads to bad decisions. So maybe it's you that needs protection from yourself. Sounds stupid I know, but if you stick to a plan it might help.",
m4yyvz,gqwzbwy,stocks,comment,1615742733,"Invest in safe, blue chip stocks. Don’t go gambling your parents retirement on meme stocks like GME and PLTR. 

Timing the market is impossible, and you’ll almost always lose money if you try. If you’re nervous about an “impending crash” (based on what, I don’t know) then invest slowly. Every week, buy 5k in stocks till it’s all reinvested.

Some recommendations of safe stocks with good dividends:

AAPL (discounted heavily at the moment)
DIS
Honeywell
WMT (also discounted)
WM
VOO
VTI
RSP
SBUX
MSFT
JNJ
V
VYM
AXP
UNP
MA
AMZN
NERD
Costco
McDonalds

With these I’ve been able to get min returns of 10-15 percent every year. It’s a diversified portfolio with many sectors so if one collapses you aren’t totally fucked. Don’t have more than 10% in any of these and you’ll be fine long term.

**EDIT: Many thanks to those who gave awards/recogniton!**

**Time Value of Money (TVM)** is the central principle of all finance, and it can work for you or against you. It's applicable to everything: Giving up some money now for more money later, or buying a dollar for sixty cents versus the other way around.

The Time Value of Money equation can be expressed as:

FV = PV x (1 + r)^(nt)

Where FV is the future value of an asset. PV is the present value. r is the rate of return. n is the number of times compounded per term. t is the term (in years) compounded. e.g. if you are compounding monthly for 30 years then n = 12, t = 30, nt = 12 \* 30 = 360.

When you're a borrower, you're paying the premium. When you're a depositor and investor, you're collecting the premium... provided that you are properly pricing assets and not buying into the inflated premiums speculators attach to stocks on the front end.

If you're old enough to remember, there was this game for the Apple \]\[ called *Taipan!* that taught Time Value of Money and compound interest in a very interesting way:

The game involved being a trader on the China Sea. It was basically the predecessor to Dope Wars... you would fight pirates, collect their treasure, buy bigger ships, buy cannons, trade arms, silk, cargo and opium. Opium was like a day trading stock. It could skyrocket for no reason. And you could get rich, then you'd get mugged by robbers and lose all your cash.

You have this Elder Brother Wu who is basically a loan shark. He can loan you money but he'll loan it to you at a usurious rate of interest... it compounds 10 percent *per turn.* And if you don't pay him off *he'll send his bodyguards to cut your throat.*

**BUT THERE'S A GLITCH...**

If you repay Wu more money than you owe him, suddenly you have a negative balance... and it grows at the same rate of interest, but in your favor. He owes you 10 percent compounded per turn.

If you play this out for a while, your balance with him grows into the billions and trillions and hundreds of trillions of British pounds. Pretty soon, the risk of getting mugged over £3 million in opium seems worthless, because by this point in the game you're making more than ~~ten~~ 1000 times that just moving from port to port, causing Wu to incur [humongous interest](https://i.imgur.com/4VtO2BL.png).

I'm not from the US and I'm not familiar with the tax code but I'm genuinely curious. You could invest for your child's education, then gift them the shares and have them sell it right away to pay for their tuition with minimal taxes. It can be done with any family members as well.

Could someone who is experienced with this explain if it's actually possible?


Edit: So I misunderstood. You don't pay gift taxes as long as it's less than 15k per year. Anything on top of that must be reported and goes to your lifetime allowance of up to 11 million tax free but anything under 15k doesn't need to be reported at all and doesn't affect the 11 million limit. However, you still pay taxes on the gains from the stock if you sell it as if you were the one who bought it all along.

m4xq26,gqwxcld,stocks,comment,1615742052,"Don't get too excited or FOMO'd into investing all in one go. Stick with your dollar cost averaging. The market is in a weird moment right now with lots of new investors and volatility. Lot's of people saying we're in a massive bubble so be careful. Having 20-30% of your money on the side is a good strategy so that if there is a big dip or crash you can put money in and benefit from the gains that will follow.

Couple of main strategies are growth investing and value investing. I like value investing because I can use metrics to analyse stocks.

I tend to use this as my main way to screen stocks:

PE Ratio (Price to Earnings) **< 25** means stock undervalued

PEG Ratio (Price to Earnings Growth) **< 1** means stock is undervalued

PB Ratio (Price to Book) **< 3** is good

All this info can be found on Yahoo Finance and other sites for free but I would also recommend SimplyWallSt, you can get a free trial to analyse stocks and filter by markets, sectors and these metrics plus much more.

Best strategy is a long term one which you seem to have identified but if you want to try more risky methods as well as your safer S&P500 strategy then there's plenty of trading apps you can use and maybe set aside a portion of your money that you want to use for these manual  trades.

Remember to be diversified, it will limit your gains but it will also limit your losses. Keep educating yourself, you seem like you're on the right track. Far too many people getting involved as a get rich quick plan, which is the total wrong way to go about things.

Choose a strategy, stick to it, stick to your ratios of how much money you're going to invest. Take your profits at certain targets. You've only made a gain or loss once the trade is closed. In general holding for a long time will get you gains but if you're going for a more day trading route you need to set targets for taking profits.

Eg. you buy a stock at 50$ and you think it's fair value is 100$, there's nothing wrong with taking profits at 60/70/80/90$",

m4y1iu,,stocks,post,1615738450,"SUMO Logic Inc: SUMO Logic went public in September for $22.00 a share. The stock dipped as low $16.71 on October 26th, 2021, before their first earnings report on December 7th (Posted in detail below), after which shares pumped to a high of $46.37 by February 8th. SUMO’s analysts ratings are excellent, analyst coverage is largely solid, and despite offering softer than expected guidance amid their most recent earnings, little has changed as far as their prospects for high growth. Of course, I see many companies this earnings season claiming “uncertainty” as a result of underlying economic conditions. More often than not I assess they’re simply managing expectations so that they can continue overperforming analysts predictions.

SUMO guidance expects between $53.2M & $54.2M in revenue for the quarter ending this upcoming April, a return of 13-15% and an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share. Consensus analysts estimates called for $53.4M and a loss of 14 cents per share. Overall they expect to grow in revenue between $231-$235M by JAN2022, an increase of 14-16% YoY, while expecting an EPS loss of 40-50 cents a share (I believe this an extreme low ball assessment). Analysts expect $234.1M and a YoY adjusted loss of 51 cents per share by JAN2022. In all they’re beating their earnings and growing slightly faster than analysts expectations, although the street seems to expect much higher growth. And of course, so do I. In FY 2018 they had $68M in revenue. In FY 2019 they grew to $103M in revenue, and by FY 2020, $155.06M. In the year ending in JAN2021 they gained $202.6M.

I do not believe, given this company’s record and clientele, that they’re going to grow less than their expected rate. And while some critics believe that this space is overcrowded, I look through their growing list of customers and see some solid names. This is not likely to slow for SUMO any time soon and I am optimistic that their revenue may grow well beyond their YoY guidance. In short, little has changed to justify such a massive over-reaction (Remember they reported amid the market correction time frame) to their most recent earnings beat, and with COVID coming to an end, I expect revenue growth to be much higher than their lowball guidance. I see SUMO stock as oversold, I assess this three month low as a bullish set up, and I think it a great dip buying opportunity that only comes around once in a blue moon. This is why I am long SUMO, and as a result, I have set up a covered strangle to take advantage of recent volatility. If you’re into stock I recommend investing safely and slowly as recommend in THIS STRATEGY.

m4mghu,gqvvd00,stocks,comment,1615713405,"Yes, I too think that $RKT is undervalued.
I'm thinking of getting in on it for the long run, but there's some things to take into consideration IMO:

- Mortgage rates are starting to recover(rise) from the lower values in 2020. This will maybe somewhat lower the number of people buying properties, which will (in theory), lower $RKT profit numbers.

- Debt to asset is at ~83% as of today. Usually having higher d2a lowers a company's ability to freely invest in innovation and growing their business. (This is far from the worst d2a, just something to keep in mind.)

- The stock is still being shorted HEAVILY in my opinion.
Last trading session was around 38% being shorted of the available share float.


On the positive side, the sentiment is high for $RKT.
They also authorized a $1bn stock buyback following the results achieved in 2020, meaning that the company has matured financially.

Anywho, I still think that $RKT is a solid play, even at $25.
The CEO is VERY bullish, as he thinks that even at $43, the stock is still heavily undervalued compared to competitors. The company drives real value for it's customers and it has a pretty solid market cap.

m4w0gs,,stocks,post,1615732049,"On Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality.",GoodRX (GDRX) - is a GOOD long-term investment

Just my opinion",

I think the US is headed toward more social medicine, so cash for prescriptions will go down. That being said, it will be interesting to see how they adjust to these policy changes.

Their S-1 was interesting, claiming an $800B market cap. Not sure I necessarily agree with their assessment of the cash-pay market. They are moving into telehealth and providing prescription services, much like Roman and Hims. But they are entering a crowded space, esp. with Amazon entering with their telehealth platform.",

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who is giving feedback and insight into the areas I didn't cover. Will Defiantly keep in mind the things I missed for my next DD.

 Some of the the biggest rebuttals people are saying is the ceiling in SK and the competition. This is defiantly something to keep in mind and look into.  As for me. I don't think this changes much in my eyes. I will wait a few weeks or months to buy because (as people have also said) it does seem pretty overvalued RIGHT NOW. With that said I still think this company has great potential and to me, most of the arguments being made against Coupang are arguments you can say about a lot of companies as well. Thanks again for the Feedback and the upvotes. Much appreciated!

&#x200B;

**---------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER--------------------------------------------------------------**

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.

📷

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

I stopped trading options after that until I did more research learned what delta/theta/... is. Now I make a constant profit off options, but I know how to evaluate the risk and not just gamble.

I say this not to shame you, just if you really want to make a profit it’s good to have an understanding on the subject, because your $300 profit this week could turn into a 7k loss next. 

But that being said it’s your money and your risk so really in the end you own your choices, best of luck!",

m506f3,,stocks,post,1615744686,"First of all, I do not own put options on Tesla, nor do I short the stock. The following thoughts came to me when a friend told me that he felt screwed by Tesla and Elon:

In recent weeks, it has been reported that Tesla admitted in an email exchange with a Californian authority that FSD is only Level 2 and that this will not change in the near future. For several years now, you can pay 7500€ (sorry, I'm European) for ""Full Potential for Autonomous Driving"". Since Elon Musk has been announcing for years that autonomous driving would be available soon (millions of robotaxis; level 5 at the end of the year), many customers (like my friend)  naturally buy this to be able to be there right from the start.

But now Tesla admits in these emails that this function will not work in the near future and that FSD is only level 2. Many people bought this system for a lot of money because Elon keeps promising that it will be available soon, although he knows very well that Tesla is still far away from it.

I would honestly feel cheated if I had believed Elon and therefore spent such a large sum of money on a driving assistant, believing it would be a fully autonomous car next year.

It's one thing not to take things too seriously, or sometimes to create somewhat high expectations, but in this case the customer is being actively deceived. It is not ok that Elon makes his customers pay for something that is not yet in sight by convincing them that it will be next year.

What do you think?",Tesla FSD: Am I the only one who thinks this way?

I don't have the link to Cathie Wood's youtube video commentary, but she mentioned that Tesla believes that autonomous driving would have 20% market penetration by 2025; ARK on the other hand believes it'll be 8% penetration; Waymo predicts 1%.

m506f3,gqx8eab,stocks,comment,1615746072,"I think Musk, like most entrepreneurs, are trying to sell us the future because we, like most consumers, get tired of the present and aroused by the unobtainable. If anyone buys what a businessman is selling you need to read the fine print -- the legal and realistic truth.

Case in point if you're willing to keep reading. During the meteoric rise of TSLA (during November, I believe) before they became part of the S&P, Musk promised a vehicle he had previous denied even existing; in fact, he had spoken out against making the vehicle -- which resembled something more than an SUV but less than a truck. He had to promise the stars of only to get his stock price to the moon (#NoOneLeftBehind). This is what businessmen like to do and Musk is not even the 100th person to do it.

Granted, one day...Lord knows when that might be...the Level 5 will be so commonplace and effective that this situation will be moot, but technology only gets better as we can generate the capacity for it and production of it.

If your friend feels cheated, so were we all when we were young and bought ""experimental"" doo-dads and whatnots because we were ""promised"" an expectation that inevitably fell short. Musk should be held accountable, as any manufacturer should be, but that fine print is tricky. The lawyers get ahold of products ling before the FDA, DOT, or any of their ilk do. There is some clause somewhere in the microscopic inking that says ""Buyer beware"" but no one can read 6 pt, even on a 4k res screen.

Most big names in tech that are developing this tell us we are at least 2-3 years away from fully functional autonomy. You see a lot coming out atm with LIDAR but general consensus is that LIDAR is only a limited short term option until they actually make it work with complete neural networks or something like that. (Check podcasts from Lex Fridman about this topic with specialists from the industry). I think Musk took a huge gamble on this and lost and it will cost Tesla. However EU law is a lot different from US law so I assume the EU claims will be really limited  in damages. Most likely Tesla will only have to reimburse EU clients for the bought package and a little extra maybe for compensation but it will be reasonable.

I am interested in researching and conducting a moving average study on specifically Tesla. 

My plan is to go through every moving average, on the 1min - daily timeframe, and back about 100-200 days.

I would count then, each time the price approaches the MA line, how many times it reacts( shows some resistance against) , bounces ( reverses trend, atleast short terms for a playable trade) and ignores( just passes through) I would do this for every time frame.

Afterwards, I would calculate the percentage of times price reacted and bounced. Obviously then I would use the MA lines with the highest percent chance of bouncing to make a trade.

What do you guys think.

I plan on starting at 9ma count by 2 or 3 up to 50,
Then continue by 5 or 10 till I reach the 200ma 

This is because I don’t want to do every single number and as you get into higher numbers the lines start to move less and less apart.

I’ve been debating a few different options and having a difficult time deciding. I will leave some of it for riskier investments, but for majority of it I would like to be smart with. The options I’ve considered are:

1. Picking one or a couple ETFs and throwing it all in now. (Very uncomfortable with this at ATH) I’ve considered protective puts with this approach but the price of those really eats into any profits
2. Throw a portion of it in now and leave some cash to buy if/when it dips.
3. Make purchases periodically to average in over a select timeline and sticking to it.
4. Buying Leaps of the ETFs I choose to capture some gains while preserving cash to buy if it goes south. I was thinking if I had money to buy 2000 shares I’d buy 20 ITM leaps.

m4meb2,,stocks,post,1615691012,"Been watching CRM for about a week. Did some digging on the stock because the price is 25% below it’s 52 wk high right now.

I’m not sure how to feel. Most of the articles I’ve read only offer one sentence type explanation for why the price is down so much. So I thought it’d be cool to ask y’all.

Bear Case:

- It has a ~50 P/E which is super high for a value stock but maybe average for a tech growth stock. 

- Up about 40% 1 year (Reference SP500 is up ~50% and QQQ is up ~70%)

- TA shows pretty clear 6 month bearish channel 

- Bond yields rising so growth stocks are taking a hit. CRM down ~12% (reference QQQ down ~6%)

Bull Case:

- Goldman just moved CRN into their conviction but category. The average analyst rating implied an upside of ~20%.  

- CRM seems to be a dominant leader in CRM and SaaS. 

- Has grown revenue ~30% YoY. Super crazy profit margins (don’t remember exact numbers but ~ 60%). Very low debt and asset/liabilities.


I should note that my source for the second point in the Bull case is from a couple YouTube videos and articles I’ve looked at; I’m not an expert so I wasn’t able to make sense of Salesforce lead in CRM or SaaS yet.

Say person A has $100,000 that he can execute a trade with, compared to person B who can only put $10,000 into one trade, can the former person leverage their situation to make more profit? I know hedge funds can cause massive fluctuations in price but I'm talking about retail investors who might be a bit on the wealthier side and can exit a position quicker than a hedge fund.

One example I can think of is low-volume stocks. If person A shorted that low volume stock with their 100k, wouldn't they be able to cause a relatively large drop in price since the volume is low and their capital can short a lot of shares? What about vice versa?

Funko is well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market “fairly soon.”

(TL;DR at the end)

=====================================================================

Here are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):

· Funko beat expectations with its second highest revenue quarter ever

· Growth is expected continue in 2021; driven by Europe, Loungefly, and other initiatives

· Operational responsiveness and flexibility has allowed Funko to thrive during the pandemic while providing a way to engage with fans in new and more creative ways

· Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release

· Funko’s CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market “fairly soon”

=====================================================================

FUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS

· Net Sales in Q4 2020 was up 6% vs Q4 2019 to $226 million

o This represented Funko’s second highest revenue quarter in its history

o Outperformance was driven by the US market which had its highest revenue quarter in history and grew 18% vs. Q4 2019

o International was constrained by lockdowns; but still grew 10% vs. Q3 2020

o Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019

· Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019

· SG&A decreased 6% to $53 million

· Cash Flow From Operations increased 69% to $47 million

· Funko’s direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to the prior year

GROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2021

· Funko is forecasting 30% revenue growth in Q1 2021 (vs. Q1 2020)

· Full year sales growth is forecasted at between 25-30%

· Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%

· Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.

o Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.

o Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys

o Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a “major master toy announcement” fairly soon

· Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth

FUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC

· Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it’s brand and products

o Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don’t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)

o As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development

· Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule

o FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns

o Given that Funko’s direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown

o Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region

· Funko’s diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic

o Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues

o Funko’s expanded games portfolio grew 50%

o Loungefly grew 55% in Q4

\-- Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year

\-- Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions

o In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few

· Funko’s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance

o Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year

o Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019

· Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible

\-- “Virtual cons” in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases

\-- Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness

\-- In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual “Funko Fair” where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.

· The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.

· Funko launched “Funko Pop Albums” in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers

o For example, the AC/DC’s classic “Black In Black” record was Funko’s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers

o Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers

MULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS

· Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng

o Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)

o Q4 EBITDA beat expectations

o Impressed by Funko’s ability to pivot during the pandemic by leaning into e-commerce, games, and soft goods

· DA Davidson analyst Lind Bolton Weiser

o Raised the target price 142% to $17.00 (from $7.00)

o Boosting their modeled multiple to 17-times earnings (from 9-times earnings)

o Believes the company is returning to growth while improving its fundamentals

· Truist analyst Michael Swartz

o Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)

o Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance

o Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform

· Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy

o Raised the target price 46% to $22.00 (from $15.00)

o Strong Q4 results

===================================================================

*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis / information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT’s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn’t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and “gut feel.” Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*. That’s all for my PSA. I’ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT’s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*

===================================================================

FUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs “FAIRLY SOON”

There aren’t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT’s right now other than Funko.

*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT’s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*

After today’s [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company’s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko’s valuation.

I don’t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT’s on Funko’s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT’s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Potential impact of NFT’s on Funko’s go-to-market strategy (speculating on how Funko MIGHT implement NFT’s to expand and reinforce their business model):

· Digital items have the ability to move globally in an instant; increasing the total addressable market. Both for Funko and for collectors.

o For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don’t have immediate access.

o For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. 

· All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT’s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.

· NFT’s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items.

o There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.

o Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.

· NFT “artists” or “creators” can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).

o Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko’s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.

Quote from Funko’s CEO [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) about NFT’s:

“We’re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we’re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT’s to our fan base and link NFT’s with physical products. And that’s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT’s. I won’t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we’re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That’s disruptive. That’s new. It’s different. It’s only what Funko can do. And we’re really excited about what the future of NFT’s are. We’re certainly all over this. And I think you’ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.”

TL;DR:

As expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko’s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko’s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko’s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this.

While Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, thier CEO's interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that the company soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT’s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a “toy company.” They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market. (Some examples: [Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30), [Funko 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Freddy-Bloody-leatherface-POP-Exclusive-12-PIECES-EXTREMELY-RARE/143968624938?hash=item218532e12a:g:RgIAAOSwEiNgQco-), [Funko 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FUNKO-Pop-Games-Fortnite-VALOR-463-Vinyl-Figure-NIB/392842180285?epid=15027456221&hash=item5b7737f6bd:g:wRMAAOSwc7Ve6lE9), [Funko 3](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-POP-Star-Wars-Holographic-Darth-Maul-SDCC-480pcs/133480926875?hash=item1f14154e9b:g:JjMAAOSwfYpfJMGL)). Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT’s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.

I truly believe FNKO is an as-of-yet undiscovered opportunity right now.

The NFT market is growing rapidly; both in usage and in dollars being spent.  However, it's still in its embryonic state.  And that's because the vast majority of people have absolutely **no** idea it even exists.

(Proof: ask someone ""What do you know about the NFT market?""  ... *crickets... )*

At some point in the very near-term, however, BIG MEDIA is going to hyper focus on the NFT market - its purpose, the opportunities it presents, the **billions** being made by both creators and investors; etc.

And when this happens - when BIG MEDIA starts *educating* people - the masses are going to want to get in on the action and make some money, too.

One of the quickest, easiest ways to make this happen?  By simply investing in a publicly-traded company already associated with the NFT market.

(Example: OSTK and MSTR; both of which have moved substantially higher as a result of these companies now being associated with a certain ""coin."")

And this is *exactly* why you should invest in FNKO **now**.  *Before* the Wall Street vultures have swooped in and picked up the (previously) inexpensive FNKO shares, and *before* you see the new car your neighbor bought sporting a FNKO license plate.

And yes; I'm long both FNKO shares and calls.",

m3z7tm,,stocks,post,1615610367,"It’s pathetic to me browsing subreddits and seeing post after post talking about how XYZ is forming a double zenith ultra harmonic convergence and is about to break out to the moon when in reality there is no merit to this “pattern”  whatsoever and the stock continues to move with randomness.

It’s even more pathetic when WSB tries to use TA, something that predicts movement based off of *patterns*, on GME, a stock that has had a completely unprecedented rise and is solely governed by sources such as news, tweets, hedge funds and market makers. 

I physically cringe anytime I see “DD” that involves a chart and every time I do see one, I instantly discredit the entire post. There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off of TA is basically that of a coin flip. Fundamental analysis, news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting a stocks immediate movement than TA could ever be.

The only glimmer of credibility I’d be willing to give TA is scalping but even then 90% of daytraders lose money so id say it’s not even paying off for them well in that regard either.

What it feels like to me is TA is a “noob trap” that attracts people who are new to the stock market because it makes them feel like they know what they are doing and they want an excuse to just gamble away their money. I’ve noticed a lot of YouTube channels prey off of people thinking they’re some God of the stock market for employing TA and it gives them false credibility when in reality they’re just guessing as much as anyone. Like some fake scam psychic tarot card reading shit. 

Not really looking for anyone to change my mind, I just had to get this out of my system although I’m curious to hear others’ thoughts.

I also believe that trade volumes convey significant information, and that looking at candlesticks may give you more insight than just a line graph.

This will probably be a long post, but then you can kill some time before market opens monday :D

I'm pretty new to investing, I got into it about 1 month ago. I'm trying to read up TA and FA, i'm not sure witch one I like the best tho. But I think maybe FA is best for beginner.

I have read, that I should try to diversify my portofolio and I have tried to do that. But those say, that it is best to only have a few stocks, when no investing more capital than I have. As said I went with diversify a bit, but meh that seems to have gone a bit wrong.

My portofolio so far is:

\- **Apple (AAPL)** \- 26 stocks - buyin price 123,15$ - my plan is very long hold on this one. Reason for buying. I liked the entery price, and I think for many years they will still be one of dominant players in phone market.

\- **Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo - SABESP (SBS)** \- 156 stocks - buyin price 7.67$ - My plan is long hold. Reason for buying. It is a water company so I saw this as a rater safe stock, as ppl will need water both now and in future.

\- **Corsair Gaming, Inc. (CRSR)** \- 60 stocks - buyin price 47,98$ auch - This one been expensiv learning lesson. With current price at 34$ this might turn into a very long hold. The reason for buying is I think they have oki position in market, and even tho that ppl will spend less time on gaming, once the world opens up, then I still think that new ppl have opened their eyes for gaming while being at home.

\- **Crayon Group Holding ASA (CRAYN.OL)** \- 125 stocks - buyin at 141.25 NKK - Plan to hold semi long. Reason for buying is that even tho I bought at high price, I still think that there is room for growth.

\- **Daimler AG (DAI.DE)** \- 25 stocks - buyin price 66,5 euro - Plan to hold untill start 2022. Reason for buying is that I wanted a luxury brand in portofolio, and I want to learn and see what happens when/if they but the truck division on the stockmarket.

\- **Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)** \- 60 stocks - buyin 43,22$ - Plan is to sell soon, cause I'm up 15% in this one. I had hoped for the world to be more open, but I think 2021 will also be a bad year for airliners. If business travel goes down in comming years, and with more debt added to the company, I think it is time to run. Reason for buying was, that I had hoped for a return to ""normal"" in spring, but looks like it will be longer.

\- **Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DBK.DE)** \- 125 stocks - buyin price 10,72 euro - Plan is to hold for 3-5 years. Reason for buying, is I wanted a bank in portofolio too, and was looking around and thought that this one could be oki. It has a name and pretty big and they are in the mid of a turn around. They have completed 85% of the turn around goals set out in 2019 and the golas should be done in 2021/2022, so I think they are on the right track.

\- **Norway Royal Salmon AS (NRS.OL)** \- 55 stocks - buyin price 202,42 NKK - Plan is to hold for 1-2 years max. Reason for buying I think there is more room for growing and with new factories opening up and with restaurants opening up later this year, I think will be positive for them.

\- **Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)** \- 25 stocks - buying price 29,09$ - plan is for long hold on this one. Reason for buying not really any, was looking for a tech stock and this one was talked about alot.

\- **Pfizer Inc. (PFE)** \- 70 stocks - buying price 34,91@ - Plan is to hold till the annual report for 2021 and then dicide what to do with it. Reason for buying guess a stable company and was interested in seeing how the vaccines will influence them.

Overall i'm down about 5% for this roughly last month since I started. Still have some cash that I need place in something.

**My investment profile**

My investment profile is mostly semi long to long. While I do try to keep up most days I feel it can be overwelming specially for a new investor, so I plan to revisit and look over my stocks like every quarter and see if I want to change something. This portofolio is for pure investing, retirement account that hold bonds, etfs, stocks etc, I don't consider that account ""investing"" but more a passiv thing. So what I want to learn with this one portofolios is to look for ""bargins"" and companies I believe in.

**My plan for idle cash/shortlist**

I still think prices on many stocks are high, so I'm not sure if to put rest of money that atm is idle in the account into more stocks.

On my list of stock to maybe buy is:

\- **Hugo Boss AG (BOSS.DE)** \- I think when ppl can return to shops, they might get a high sale.

\- **Halliburton Company (HAL)** \- With olie prices up and it looks like Texas might open fully up, maybe this one, could be a bet if not buying BP, Chevon etc.  
\- **Index fonds** with focus on the european markets - if the US is ""overpriced"" compared to EU-markets then this could be option I think.  
\- **Essity AB (publ) (ESSITY-B.ST)** \- Is a women personal care mostly, and with ppl going out more women also needs more personal care products :)

**My questions are the following:**

\- Is my portofolio totally messed up?

\- Is it oki to discuss european stocks here? I mostly see US stocks - that is great cause gives me information about the US stock market. I'm from Europe (DK), so sometime I miss talks about european stocks.  
\- When I started to buy the stocks I thought the prices on nearly all stocks were very high and was a bit scary of jumping into investing, but with the negativ rates in the bank, I though was better to invest. But in times like this when stockmarket is really high, is it then oki to be mostly semi-long to long, or is it better to marke more trades and taking small profits?  
\- How did you get started? Reading books? Podcasts? YT?  
\- Have you ever doubted your trades and how did you handel it? Sometimes when I see red numbers I feel like I suck at it, and to affraid to cut losses, is there a way to overcome the feeling and say enough is enough, let me just sell and move on?  
\- Based on my investment profile and shortlist/plan - do you have other recomendations? (the markets I can trade on is US, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway)

Ty for taking your time to read the wall of text :)",My way into investing so far - loss 5%
m4rgzs,gqvufc4,stocks,comment,1615712434,"Hi fellow eurobro, Italian living in Norway here!

From what I read, you've little confidence in many of your picks, which is not a good sign. Do you know what Crayon does? Do you know 70% of their business is from a single client? (Microsoft, which is good, but still a single client). To know everything about a company you own will increase conviction and will be easy to stick with it in downturns. 

If you're a beginner, I would advise you to invest first in ETF such as VOO, VTI, QQQ or even SMH if you know the Semiconductors market. There are EU alternatives as well to those ones. I would allocate 90% to ETF, and 10% to stock picking while learning. In the meantime learn how to evaluate a company, to read financial statements or at the very least the concepts of PE, PS, PB, PEG, cash flow etc. Once you get more skilled in picking stocks, I'd increase my single stock %.

Always keep something like 15% cash for good opportunities like last month. By studying and identifying the company you like you'll be ready when everyone panics to buy them at a discount, because you've done your homework before.

And remember that 99% of traders don't beat the market. Index investing and dollar cost averaging is boring but it works, especially because it removes the worst enemies of an investor: fear, greed and emotions in general.",

Look to put some ETFs in for some core stability. An S&P tracker like VOO, some geo-diversification and some industry specific.",
m4rgzs,gqvvxc6,stocks,comment,1615713996,"\-Is your portfolio messed up?  
No it's better than 90% of the portfolios you see here, at least you thought a little about why you bought what and didn't just go 100% US-Tech. That said I wouldn't recommend buying something just because ""people are talking about it"" that isn't a good strategy. If yo ain't 100% confident in your stock picks, you might also want to include some index funds. You could do something like 20% Total US market, 20 developed markets, ex US, 20% emerging market and 40% individual stocks. you can also do a 30/30/30/10 split and just follow two stocks closely, to really learn what it's like to invest in individual stocks.

\-Is it okay to discuss EU stocks  
Yes. We have a lot of people from the US here, and US stocks have done great in the past, so naturally, you get a lot of people thinking that US stocks are the only stocks that make sense to invest in, which is false. People also somehow got the idea that ""they know US stocks better"" something I can't exclude, but I highly doubt they know them better than any other stocks, at least to any meaningful extent. That said accounting regulation differs between countries, and you need to be aware of this if you invest in individual stocks around the world.

\-Are prices too high?  
Too high? I don' know, but prices are very high, which has a negative impact on future returns.  
To quote every financial article ever written. ""If things go well stocks might go up, but if things go poorly they might also go down""  
In any case, it's better to be invested than not. If you are very worried and are sitting on a lump sum, you can divide that sum by 12, and invest it over 12 months.

\-How did I get started.  
Youtube inspired me at first.  
I would start by watching the lectures Aswath Damodaran got on his channel. That should get you started with the basics. When you're done with that I can provide you with a reading list if you are interested.

\-Have you ever doubted your trades  
Yes I think that's true for everyone. Back in September when the market was setting all-time highs I was down 16% for the year. I was not happy. Today I am up 24% vs the markets 22% since 01/012020. every single person that invests in individual stocks will have periods of underperformance, in some cases, they will underperform massively.  
For me two things really help. The first is just knowing what you are doing. If you know the companies you are buying are solid, you know it's stupid to sell when they are down. In fact doing anything other than buying more would be stupid. After all, if the price is down 16%, but the fundamentals are the same, my return must be 16% higher now..  
Another trick I use is to only look at my portfolio when I buy and sell stocks. Not much is going to change in a company in a month, and the only time you get enough information to truly act is with the quarterly report, so unless you find a new company you want to invest in, you can't make a lot of meaningful changes outside of earnings season anyway, so just don't bother looking, or in the case of most people. Just fight the urge to look. It gets easier with time.

\-Any suggestions  
I already suggested the 20/20/20/40 or the 30/30/30/10 split between indexes and individual stocks, and I stand by that.  
Next time ask one question at a time. I'm not even going to proofread this that's how long it is, so I'm sorry about all the errors.",

m4hb9t,,stocks,post,1615675021,"I was having a conversation with someone on this subreddit about how many stocks you should have in your portfolio at one time. In my research, there is no consensus as to how many you should have. I have 32 different companies in my portfolio right now and will be adding five more with money from my stimulus check. 

I’m not aiming for a set number, but I’ll likely have 30-50 from different sectors and build up my positions in those companies. I do research on all of these companies and keep up with current news on them as best I can. Assuming I continue to do my DD on every position I have, how many stocks would you recommend having? Is there a number you would consider too many?",How Many Stocks is Too Many
m4hb9t,gqudaqp,stocks,comment,1615675474,"Too many, theoretically none, but a well diversified portfolio only needs about 20-30 stocks to protect you from unsystematic risk. Of course, systematic risk (market risk) can hit you no matter how diversified you are (covid, inflation, etc...). Once you start going beyond 30, you might as well be in ETFs.",
m4hb9t,gquh2go,stocks,comment,1615677619,"It all depends on your own risk tolerance, I find that being heavily diversified the gains per year was slow as each sector fluctuates, for example company A can 2x and you think wow, but to your portfolio the rise could be very minimal because of the high diversification. 

When I first started I held around 25, but have since dwindled that number down, currently around 15-16 but my plan is to go to around 10-12. 

Plus who has the time to read up on 20+ companies each quarter? I can barely keep up with 10 as it is.

This is just me though.",
m4hb9t,gquddsk,stocks,comment,1615675523,"How many companies/industries can you fully understand? That number is different for everyone, so there isn't a clear answer to your question. 

If you can't adequately explain a company you're invested in then you probably not an informed investor. 

For me personally, I rarely if ever have over 10 individual stocks in my portfolio. Right now that number is closer to 5.",

m4hb9t,gquskxk,stocks,comment,1615684325,A man died once by eating 413 chicken nuggets. So I would say anything under 412 and you're fine.,
m4hb9t,gqugqhp,stocks,comment,1615677428,"Depends. If you learn about risk management traditionally/mathematically, then you're looking at 15-30 stocks that should be as diverse as possible; there's a model that found that after ~25 different stocks, the rate at which you decrease the risk (std. dev.) basically starts tapering off. The idea is that you're looking to hedge risk as much as possible while maximizing your returns.

However, how many people actually follow this? This kind of explanation relies on traders/investors being 100% rational and data-driven, which no one is. That's why there's a million different equations/theories as to how to manage your portfolio-- some will keep in mind your risk tolerance, personal preferences, etc. There isn't anything wrong with having >20 different stocks since it hedges risk, but it also minimizes your gain. It's a trade-off and it comes down purely to preference.

I will agree with the other commenter though. If you're looking at a ton of different sectors, it might be a good idea to start investing in ETFs instead. Unless you trade for a living, I feel like it's way too much time to do DD on each and every company.",

&#x200B;

I actually like the reverse split - people must remember that GE was one of the most widely held stock and a dividend darling for years for the ""boomer"" generation. With their divestures over the last three years coupled with restructuring the number of outstanding were grossly exaggerated.

Most reverse splits are done to maintain NYSE / NASDAQ listing requirements - this is not the case with GE.

The new CEO has a tremendous track records and hold people accountable - not like Immelt and Flannery were idiots - I actually sold all my share after hearing Immelt give a talk - I did not trust him.

I brought back at $6 range and like the aviation and healthcare. They also got power stream-lined and the renewable platform will pay dividends for years.

I am just waiting for Steven Tusa to give an update analyst review and if positive, it will be off to the race.",
m4cbca,gqtrxhf,stocks,comment,1615663764,"GE is an American company who focuses on power generation, air travel (engines), and medical machinery. Two of the three are key aspects of Biden’s Build Back Better plan. The last will/has been positively impacted due to the coronavirus pandemic and our increasing use of the medical industry. (Medicare for all is coming, who is supplying the machinery to meet that demand?)

They are the largest producer of wind turbines in America. As we phase into renewable power, wind energy is at the top of the list. (Halide-X)

Nuclear Power is the final destination of renewable energy. Who do you think is going to produce the machinery, if not General ELECTRIC. 

Long term and short term, GE as a company has upsides. See above. 

Technically, GE is at their pre-covid price after consolidating around 10-11.50 for a few months, and broke out into the uptrend the past month. GE just announced an 8-1 reverse split, which may have caused the 15% drop in price over the last few trading days, which was quickly bought up at close of Thursday and all of Friday. I think this was really profit taking from their run from 7. Short term they’re still in an uptrend. 

Through the previous year, GE hit some serious support on their long term downtrend (previous few years) and are now positioned to head to the top of the channel they’re trading in and test that. Think 20-25 before they are met with serious resistance.

I hold Jan 2022 and Jan 2023 Calls at varying strikes, mostly $20 for both. June 21 $15. Sept 21 $15. 

Don’t listen to this noise on the management. They are getting paid big bucks to get their name dragged through the mud. Culp is bringing GE to the present.

Happy Friday everyone!

What a god damn close. Almost hit that $12 mark but couldn't quite squeeze it out, my thanks to all of you beautiful people who bought in the last 15 minutes of trading. 3.2 MILLION shares traded in the last 15 minutes to try and reach that strike price of $12. We still have after-hours to look at, so we may actually close at or above $12. We met our max pain of $10, which is amazing. Up 23% on the week, incredible.

Thank you all for averaging down, and buying the dip. We are going to have A LOT of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well. Keep accumulating, keep holding, and let's keep the momentum up.

Let's take a quick glance at the chart, as well as options for March 19.

We are above the 50-day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross, a bullish signal.

Hourly: RSI screaming overbought. Looking like a retracement imminent.  
Bollinger bands are expanding, this is good, but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them. Every time we've overextended the bands we retrace.  
Monday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but I will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement.  
4-hour: RSI almost overbought. A cool-off may need to happen.  
Bollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top. If we keep hugging the top this is good. The bands didn't get as tight as I wanted but that's okay. This could be a signal we remain moving up.

Daily: RSI smack dead in the center. Very healthy.  
Bollinger bands are contracting more and more. If they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days.  
4/5 days this week have been green. I like green crayons. They taste the best.  
This is the highest daily volume we've had since March 4th and before that, Feb 25th. I remind you though 3.2 million of those shares came up in the last 15 minutes of trading to try and reach that $12 strike price.

Weekly: RSI slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy.  
Bollinger bands are still wide.  
Our first green candle in the last 7 weeks, and it is a big one. The second-lowest weekly volume that we've had since the beginning of the year. This is huge because we don't need volume to move up. This means people are not selling and are accumulating. We know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying.

Monthly: Fuck you. Not relevant right now. Shut up.

Every whole number ($10.00, $11.00, $12.00, etc for you dingbats) will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through. Each will be somewhat difficult, but not near as hard as the one I have set \~$14.44. This one was the gap-up signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on Jan 28th, acted as support on Feb 1st, and then resistance on Feb 8th. Once this is secured we will need to get past it, retest it as support, and if it acts as support this $BB will absolutely fly.

Options baby, taken from [http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb](http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb) for March 19th, 2021.

Total Open Interest Calls: 198,238  
Total Open Interest Puts: 59,407

Put/Call ratio: 0.29. This is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish. To be bullish, the ratio typically sits below 0.70.

The highest call open interest? 15.00 at almost 24k open contracts, second highest is $20.00 at 20k.  
The highest put open interest - 8.00 with 7k, second is 10.00 with almost 6.5k contracts.

Do I see 8 happening next week? No, I really don't. Are opinions like assholes, everyone has one.  
Could we close at $10 next week? Absolutely possible. We have signs that we could go in either direction.  
Max pain next week is $9. Should be easy, but so is yo momma.

My thoughts for next week? I don't fucking know. I don't have a crystal ball god damn it. Fuck off.

If I was a magician, I'd say it would be green. About the same % as this week but I have confirmation bias and I also beat my weewee to Kim Possible when I was a teenager. Your guess is as good as mine, but I digress. Lots of signals to go either direction.

This is not advice to buy or sell but a mixed bag of what's happening and the opinion of a degenerate. I love lamp.

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites ADA and WCAG accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, GameStop, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $1.43 Billion 
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position.

m4iaqz,,stocks,post,1615677975,"**Summary**

* Triterras is a global trade finance company that is using blockchain technology to bring financing opportunities to parties with who banks do not want to work with due to increased regulations and thus lower margins with traditional systems.
* Recent price action is due to accusations of fraud in a short report which caused a 50% price drop.
* My belief is that many of the allegations are not substantive, and the ones I haven't dismissed are highly speculative.
* Recent events have added support to the companies reliability and future growth and have, in my opinion, resolved the worry of fraud.
* Recent filings show the short float might suddenly jump from 36% to 45%-50% due to a decrease in the float.
* If this is the case, then a strong price reversal is imminent.

**Company Overview** 

[Triterras](https://triterras.com/) is hoping to address the market of small and medium-sized companies who do global trade but who do not work with large enough supplies to qualify for traditional financing with banks. This is largely due to new stricter regulations to protect the parties involved. Such regulations are beneficial in avoiding cases of fraud, but make it less worthwhile for banks to work with companies who don't make enough money to qualify the increased effort and thus lower profit margins on the bank's side.

Triterras is using blockchain technology to more efficiently provide financing whilst still meeting the new regulatory requirements. They're not the only company trying to do this, but they're the one who is furthest ahead. They are also largely focused on bringing traders to the platform, fully aware of the fact that the network effect is both the greatest hurdle and greatest advantage in situations like this.

**What happened?**

A couple of short reports ([A](https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-triterras-trit)) ([B](https://phase2partners.egnyte.com/dl/bZMK5uwx27/)) were released with accusations of fraud. The former is relatively speculative, but it has been shared on Reddit before so I included it. Many of the concerns seem far-fetched, especially given the renewed support recently (discussed later). The later report is far more detailed. Many of the accusations are directly discussed in Triterras's [announcement](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/triterras-company-statement-in-response-to-short-report) and have in fact already been brought up by the SEC in an earlier [form](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-033318/). Obviously, Triterras didn't provide as much of an answer as I would have liked, but again I think many of the accusations are speculative. A seeking alpha article provided a very thorough look into the situation and much of the comments section furthered the discussion with really valuable perspectives (written by 1035 Capital Management, I cannot link the article per sub rules). I highly recommend reading through all of these resources in full.

As a result of these reports, the share price fell from the $11-$14 range to the $6-$8 range. I believe a large number of short positions were taken out during this time, see [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/TRIT) and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/trit). The current shares shorted is around 8 million shares with a float of around 24 million shares.

**Recent Events**

Recently, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/37/triterras-announces-strategic-partnership-with-western) a partnership with Western Union, a massive leader in money transfers and financial services. The description of the partnership provides renewed support in Triterras being a sound company with a hopeful future. 

Moreover, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/38/triterras-signs-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-invoice-bazaar) the intent to purchase Bazarr, furthering the regional expertise of the company and providing renewed support for future growth.

**Institutional Ownership and Buyback**

Here is where things get a bit more speculative. With the drop in share price, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/triterras-authorizes-50-million-share-repurchase-program) a $50 million dollar buyback. The verbiage used is 

*""Triterras’ recent share price has created an attractive opportunity for the company to institute a stock repurchase program. The Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may or may not be conducted through 10b5-1 plans.""* 

The key is that the buyback may be done through privately negotiated transactions, remember this.

Looking at the holders on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRIT/holders?p=TRIT), we can see that Fidelity owns a large number of shares through both FMR LLC and Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunity Fund (I'll call them FAGOF, lol). On 02/08 they submitted a [SC 13G form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001327/) to the SEC detailing their new positions (this data is not accounted for on yahoo finance yet). We see that FMR LLC's position is essentially unchanged, while FAGOF more than doubled their position, from 2.2 to 5 million shares. A month later, on 03/10, they submitted another [SC 13G/A form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001436/) detailing their new position. Now, we see that FMR LLC owns only 56 shares. During that time, the share price was around $7. That brings the value of their position during that time to around $50-$60 million. Now the trading volume during that time was only a couple million a day, and we see a steady decline from mid-February to late-February. So, and here's the speculative part, my belief is that FMR LLC sold a majority of their position to Triterras as part of the $50 million buyback previously mentioned. The remaining shares were slowly liquidated from mid-February to late-February.

But wait, why would FMR LLC sell all their shares, especially when the price was so low? Well first, so far as I can tell, we don't know what they paid for those shares. It's entirely possible they still made a profit even at this price point. In general, I imagine, Funds like these don't like to participate in stocks that are so crazy volatile and not super reliable. Triterras is a growth company, and the recent news and everything going crazy may have encouraged Fidelity to back out of the craziness. On the other hand, Fidelity's fund focused on growth, FAGOF, which can take the volatility and risk, more than doubled their stake.

Let's assume that 6-8 million shares of FMR LLC's position were sold directly to Triterras through an off-market deal. Triterras already said this was an option, and FMR wouldn't want to trade that many shares on the open market with such a low average volume since it would tank the price. That means the buyback is complete, and the float is now around 16-18 million shares. Further, this means the short float, which was 36%, is now around 45%-50%. Also, right now, the daily volume is low, so the days to cover is around 3, according to the latest [short interest report](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/trit/short-interest).

**Now What?**

Well, if the accusations are true, then the company will probably go bye-bye, or at least get another drop and take a while to recover or just fizzle away into nothingness. But, if instead, the accusations are false or insignificant, then I expect a good price reversal. The current price is only depressed because of the belief in the accusations. So, with a renewed sense in the companies outlook, and a potential 50% short float, the price could easily go back to its past levels or higher.

EVRI is an online/casino/fintech company. They provide casino floors with their slot machines and cash/reward/loyalty programs. They also have a small portfolio of online games/gambling. You can see some of the slot machines on their website. [The Willie Nelson machine is my favorite](https://www.everi.com/games/library/willie-nelson/). They also have a lot of current and past pop culture games which I can absolutely see being big in the casino space.

BCC is my favorite mid cap play. Lumber prices increasing big time. Not enough supply yet due to forest fires and lower production due to covid.

Paysafe is paysafe, I think slightly valued above traditional mid cap valuation, but not massive. These are really the only three companies I have in my portfolio that are in this range other than corsair which most people would not consider a sleeper. I don't see these companies growing faster than most large cap companies however, so I'm going to be ignoring adding to them and adding to PINS/AAPL.

EVs: OK, yeah, everyone knows this already and a lot of EV stocks are way overvalued at the moment. But among the winners in this space, I think we'll all look back in 15-20 years and you won't even be able to see a bump on the chart. We're talking about the entire fucking world moving from ICE to EVs. Of course, all the existing automakers will transition too, taking a big part of the pie, but right now is the disruption period where new companies can come in and take their piece too. Looking this far ahead, it'll be hard to lose money no matter what price you get in at now, provided the company is one of the ones that survive. TSLA is an obvious choice.

Fake meat: This too will take over in the next 15-20 years. I'm really noticing a lot more vegetarian and vegan products as well as restaurants popping up everywhere. The move to stop killing animals for food is growing at a faster rate now than it ever did. 30 years ago, I literally didn't know one vegetarian. Today, you meet new vegans every day. I'm not saying meat will go away completely. Probably not. But a large part of our diets will be plant based. Especially once boomers die off. The younger generation has grown up in an environment of sustainability and compassion for animals like I've never seen. Lab grown meat may someday take over (probably) but the technology is not here yet so for now it's plants. Here too, the obvious choice is the only big player on the market: BYND. Also TTCF but I'm not sold on them just yet. Probably worth a bet though. If/when Impossible IPOs then I'll sell my soul for some stock.

m4i6p3,gqujdz2,stocks,comment,1615678966,"I'm not too familiar with Hindenburg before the CLOV short report but Citron has been coasting off their (correct) thesis on Valeant for several years. I remember he was trying to target Shopify, Nvidia, and Tesla but was wrong. Then got fucked on GME.

I think they split their things up into their legitimate convictions and then there's some backroom stuff going on where they target companies to give entry opportunities to, I guess other firms they have some affiliation with? Because a few months later they generally announce they close the short and announce they're out.

Then why not remain short indefinitely and ride it to zero since their thesis often amounts to accusations of outright fraud? If they're concerned with short squeezes it seems like they had longer to ride it down before covering. It's not some skepticism but accusation of outright fraud: in other words an all-or-nothing proposition. With SPACs the last 3 short reports are very heavy with insinuation and scare language. The common investor probably does not have a good familiarity with what a DoJ inquiry or affiliated parties among customers means - so the authors will maximize the sinister quality of it.

I'm seeing this with Triteras and with Phase2. I saw  a wave of funds file Form 13F on fintel which means that the institutions don't take the thesis seriously, because this was a month after the short presentation. Other longs researching this reached out directly to Phase2 asking for more info on the blockchain transactions to verify if the management's response was true and got angry reactions instead of providing it when it was in their best interest to do so. So waited to get in below $7, then boom Western Union partnership and it spikes to 8.00.

And there's also a bunch of smaller no name hedge funds on Twitter usually hopping on the bandwagon, also claiming to immediately cover their shorts way too soon if they actually believed they were correct. So it's just a part of the overall Stocktwits and media message and sentiment game.

So they're not necessarily enemies, they create tons of opportunities. With the TRIT timeline I got the chance to see how the smart money responded (by going long en masse, which I could publicly see on fintel in late Feb, not a secret at all), read the rebuttals and debates, and then I could follow, all before the rip up comes. It felt strange to have such a big window for a regular retail investor to grasp the situation and get in, like a free info arbitrage trade.  I think it's a pretty weak effort to keep people out, but if you wait a few months after SPACs IPO for the attack, seems like a great opportunity to swoop in with a lot more information. Of course if you're already in BEFORE the short attack it will suck.

However, with NKLA, Hindenburg was absolutely dead on. But the style of presentation is completely different. Brutally and fully destructive, scorched earth, every little sordid detail laid out (like the president of the battery company with the scam tech blowing the money on prostitutes lol). Meaning, they use all the ammunition and damning evidence they have: what does this imply when they don't? They resort to insinuation and 'hint hint' language when they lack it, which seems to be the case with CLOV. In the future I really think they're going to mix it up and make it less obvious, but right now they don't care since it's just a couple guys in specific communities that get to exploit them.

But SPAK did find a bottom recently, a few people called it correctly that I've been trading/investing with. The opinion I've seen is that we're going to look back at this time and won't be able to believe we got into all these companies at such cheap prices.

Whether intentional or not, this is trying to condition the savvy investor to not take part in SPACs immediately and wait for the short reports. I think there is truth to Wall Street despising the SPAC process for getting retail investors into IPOs so much cheaper.

Would love to see a compilation of all SPAC and short reports in the last say 5 years. There has to have been a study done on them.",

Constellation Software (CSU) is a much younger version of Roper Technologies (ROP).  Think Berkshire Hathaway plus technology.  Also, the scope of the software offerings is broader for the former than for the latter.

This little-known Canadian play in vertical market software returned at least 3600% between mid-2010 and mid-2020.  More importantly, the stock went up *even as interest rates went up in 2016*, because all acquisition targets were already profitable and cash-flow-generating businesses, and were also bought at a discount.  In other words, all acquisitions were a corporate exercise in value investing.

In turn, this company has a little brother of its own, Canadian-based Enghouse Systems (ENGH), and has also spun out European-focused Topicus (TOI).

The earlier question isn't about any of the aforementioned companies specifically.

Is there potential for one or more ""next Constellation Softwares"" that are in the business of acquisitions for building vertical market software empires as lucrative as the above, especially as we come closer to 2023-2024 and beyond?

#**The Basics**

**Financials** - This is one of the most important things to look for in a company when considering an investment. Things like where they get their revenue and how diversified it is. Look at earnings reports and see if they have consistent EPS growth. A healthy company will show modest income and strong ERs. Apart from the revenue find how much debt they have long term and how much it really equates to that specific industry. Things like market cap and annual sales give you an idea of how large the company is and what size you're dealing with. Typically larger companies have healthier financials and positive revenue hence blue chip stocks. The more you look at this the better idea you'll have of what good financials look like.

**Data** - This is where you get into the ins and outs of the stocks performance. This ties in with chart analysis and technicals which I will briefly touch on. Here you are looking at the numbers, net income, sales, cash flow, public float, dividend, and short interest. My go to is checking the short interest % because it gives you an idea of the number of short sellers vs long term shareholders. Less shorters usually = more sustainable profits long term. Different websites also have analysts that give a consensus rating for the current stock's value, these can be nice as long as you don't only look at one. Along with that they also give out 1 year target price estimates. Gather the data together and take notes.

**News** - News is a big factor in DD and often has a big influence on the stocks value. Depending on the intensity and how big the news is, it can create selloffs, surges, etc. It's important to note that news is certainly not everything as a lot of the time it will present underwhelming or even irrelevant depending on what the intraday market trend is. This provides good opportunities for entry points if the news is slightly bad but not long term because the dip will only be temporary. News can be so many different things ranging from employee layoffs, financials, products, etc. Gather it together and assess how you think it will influence value. You have to be on top of news and have sources to be up to date because the market reacts almost instantly. (Refer to source section at bottom)

**History &amp; Technicals** - Next up we have the technicals, i'm merging this with history because this is what I do. Here you mainly want to look at 5 year charts and then get into the 1 year to stay current. Search for healthy trend lines and sustainability for the long term. When looking at these you're seeing the stock's history and how it performed under past market trends. I like to see how they did during the 2008 recession and note how fast they recovered. This can be a good reference for current and future market dips (pandemics).Find bearish or bullish indicating patterns to represent the current future of the value. The shorter you plan on holding, the more technicals are required.

**Sector**- Last but not least is sector position. The company's industry can be performing really well or really poor depending on the economic situation. For example tech companies have been showing stronger trends during the pandemic rather than retailers for numerous reasons. Similar to the oil crisis situation that brings all the oil stocks down. This is a starting point when investing in a company and determining how you think their sector will do in the future. Many traders stay specific to industries they know well, as myself i'm big on the entertainment/psychedelics area.

*Sources*

There are many websites that report news and data but here are my favorites.

Market Watch is my favorite and I use them to find stock data most of the time

Investopedia - great for news

Market Beat - data, analysts, etc

Yahoo Finance - news, good source for everything

Finviz - technicals, screeners

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since that's the basics and general overview, here's a compilation of various processes and tips that will hopefully offer a little more specificity and assistance. 

**Free sources I can check:**

- Wikipedia: Read the story behind their company
- Company site: What they do
- Seeking Alpha: Latest analysis
- Sec Site: Read 10Q and 10K (Unaudited financials and company filings)

**What I need to be capable of understanding:**

- The company's plan for growth
- Your own level of confidence in your research
- The challenges and economic cycles of this industry 

Be able to summarize/condense the business or industry in a short paragraph or a couple of sentences. 

**Moat** 

- What is the Moat?

- How hard is it to compete with this company?

- Compare this company to its competition.

- What are the Big Four Growth Rates (Net Income, Book Value, Sales, Operating Cash)? Are they speeding up or slowing down?

- Does the company have enough cash to last several year if it looses money?

- How were sales and earnings during the last recession?

**Management**

- Does the CEO have integrity?
- Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well but clam up or disclaim responsibility when trouble occurs?
- How happy are its employees?
- Does the company have any debt? If yes, could it be paid with one or two years of free cash flow?
- Has the company indicated that it plans to take on debt any time in the future?
- Is the management team buying or selling its company's stock? (Inside investors)
- How are the Return on Equity and Return on Invested Capital Numbers of the year?

The next day I was watching my account as the stock price went up to 330, 340, 345, etc. It was +$6k, and I thought it was going to keep going up. Ten mins later the stock price is at 176 and the call is at -$3.1k. Lol.

That was when I learned that you should sell your call option when you're +200%.

I also learned about theta decay, as it's value got completely destroyed over the next two days while the stock price floundered around like a magikarp. 

Thursday at close I was looking at a 2.5k loss on the contract.

Somehow sold it today at $293, the exact top, and made $1k on it.

It's been a roller coaster of a week, and I'm fortunate to have learned a ton and also narrowly avoided a $3.1k loss.

m3c0lk,,stocks,post,1615531758,"I know that no one likes a bear and furthermore people feel connected to this stock since their kids play the game or because it's a video game and it's fun to invest in that stuff but facts over feelings when dealing with money because it has no feelings. So first we have to base our value, the company raised 528 million$ from private sources last year at a valuation of 28 billion dollars. It later went public via direct listing at a base valuation of 32 billion with 40$ stock price only to rise to 77$ and a market cap of 40.56 billion. The problem with this is Microsoft bought Mojang (so essentially the Minecraft IP) for 2.5 billion  in late 2014 when they had 38 million in revenue which is relatively nothing compared to RBLX now but when we go back in time to just 2017 it (Rblx) had relatively only 45 million in revenue vs Minecraft's 350 million. Now let's go to last year when Minecraft had a monthly active user base of 130 million players vs Rblx's 150 million. It also had 953 million dollars in revenue but with 253 million in net losses. Now compare that to Minecraft who had a revenue of 415 million which is up significantly from  the previous years 375 million and it becomes clear that Roblox is very overvalued. Furthermore to show the point we have another Microsoft purchase, this time of Zenimax  Media inc for 7.5 billion $ for properties like TES, DOOM, Fallout, Dishonored, Starfield and many more with a wide variety of studios included like Bethesda, Zenimax, Tango, Arkane (Deathloop), Id and Machine Games . Just in that bundle Doom Eternal (1 game) had revenue of 350 million dollars and Skyrim with lifetime revue of over 620 million. The last showing of this is Sony's purchase of Insomniac in 2018 for 229 million dollars and since then have created 2 games that have raked in more than the initial investment with Spiderman 2018 and Spiderman MM having brought in approximately 250-270 million $ and with another game in the pipeline with Ratchet and Clank A rift in Time. Final note: EA's entire market cap which consists of Madden, Battlefield, Fifa ( yearly releases with micro transactions) and many other titles is at 30 billion, Take Two which owns GTA, Red Dead,  NBA 2K and many others and is valued at 20 billion, the thought that Roblox is worth almost more than both these titans combined is insane and nonsensical.

Edit: **This is my opinion not advice.** To play devils advocate since a lot of people like the stock here you go: Roblox has doubled it's earnings every year since 2017 and had record revenue of almost 950 million this past year. It's player base is also massive and almost doubling every year just like it's revenue. It also has 830 million in the bank right now and can easily grow by going to Asia and or incorporating more adult themes. Now other than the fact that it's trading 40x P/S you have to bet that the game will both keep growing and making profits at the same pace as now which I don't see but here there u go.",Roblox is insanely overpriced

m4rqiu,gqx1snu,investing,comment,1615743754,"Question about Big Lots Stock:  
Let me start this by saying I'm no where near an expert on financial analysis / stock valuation, the reason I'm posting this is because I want to find the flaws in my thinking, or on the off chance that I may be onto something it would help point me in the right direction.

First, the **price to earnings (p/e)** of big lots when compared to its competitors.

**BIG: 3.75**

COST: 33.84

TGT: 20.89

WMT: 29.70

DLTR: 17.96

This was the first metric that caught my interest. Why is big lots trading so cheap? Are they in massive debt? Low revenue streams? What's the deal?

**Price to sales (p/s)**

**BIG: 0.38**

COST: 0.82

TGT: 0.97

WMT: 0.71

DLTR: 0.95

Again by this metric big lots is selling 2 - 2.50x cheaper in comparison to its competitors.

**Debt to equity**

**BIG: 2.35**

COST: 2.93

TGT: 2.80

WMT: 1.87

DLTR: 1.97

Big Lots is just about average in this sector. Not great but not horrible either.

**Revenue growth** **Past 5 Years (per annum)**

**BIG: 9.14%**

COST: 11.80%

TGT: 10.89%

WMT: 0.53%

DLTR: 14.31%

With big lots showing relatively consistent revenue growth should they be trading as cheap as they are? They aren't losing money and are still showing competency.

In conclusion, I'm not seeing any sufficient reason why Big Lots is trading substantially cheaper than competing companies. Big lots doesn't show any signs of weakness in any area (that I'm aware of) I know there's probably a lot I'm missing and I welcome any criticism/critique you may have.

m4rpz1,gqwj3au,investing,comment,1615735045,"Between my tax refund (with rebates from last year), upcoming stimulus, and upcoming paycheck, I'm about to come into about $6k. I plan on putting all of this into investments and/or paying off debt.

I'm 25 and I'm currently working a full-time job making about $45k/yr, have $20k federal student loan debt, and I'm planning on going back to grad school in 1-3 years (PhD). This means the next 5-10 years I'm going to making subsistence income and living in austerity, yay! My main goal is that once I get done with my PhD and get a job (or go the academic route and do a postdoc) I'll be in a decent enough spot financially to make the big purchases like a house. So I basically want to let the money I'm making and saving right now working for corporate america work for me while I'm a poor grad student. My career choice isn't particularly lucrative (solid middle class income, will likely make at least $50-60k but unlikely to surpass $100k, depending on where I live and the jobs I take of course) so in general I'm looking to get a head start on some extra income so that I can pursue my passion without hurting financially in the longterm. If you didn't know... academia is NOT lucrative. :(

With student loan forbearance in place right now, I'm not in any rush to start paying those off. There are a bunch of repayment plans and I'm not sure what to do yet, but my current student loan balance is $20,850.02 with my individual loan interest rates ranging from approx. 4.5-5%.

All in all, main goal is ""career won't make my wealthy, investing might"". I don't want to be TOO risky, but I do want to make aggressive investments. I currently have put 4k in stocks (didn't do enough research initially, but still am in the green so I'm happy) an 1.4k in crypto (bought right before elon bought bitcoin so that's doing quite well). Those numbers are respectively 4.25k and 1.9k now. I also have a 401k through my work for the maximum match invested in the 2060 vanguard fund that I don't intend on touching til retirement. I also have enough saved in case anything comes up in the next few months.

Anyway, hopefully that wasn't too much info. In short, I'm coming into ~$6k that I want to invest somewhat aggressively and don't plan on tapping into until 2030ish and I'm wondering what I should put it into. I'm leaning toward Ark ETFs, Apple and BRK.B right now. The first two are on ""discount"" right now from my understanding and BRK.B seems to be a good balance between the aggression/speculative investing of the other two.

Even on really simple cases of a few shares bought a year ago and never traded at any point later, the cost basis is just... wrong? For my entire portfolio, plus a few dollars/share here, minus a few dollars/share there, not really any reasoning for any of it, but definitely an overall much lower total cost basis than actually should have been there.

If you haven’t left Robinhood yet, get out. This kind of technical incompetence isn’t just embarrassing, it’s scary. You don’t want to keep your money in a clown car.

Edit: For those saying they never received cost basis, note that I only received mine more than a full month later and after I sold some shares - the transfers went through on 2/5-2/8 and I got a statement indicating cost basis was updated on 3/10 for shares which I'd sold (and cost basis information appeared on all other shares). Somehow the date in the cost basis is correct on Vanguard, but the amounts are wonky (roughly the date of the transfer, but the purchase date is correct for some, for others random values). For example, 4 shares of EA came through as 141.50, but my entire history with RH only has one purchase for 147.25 - https://imgur.com/a/GwvQRSH","PSA: If You recently left Robinhood, double check your transferred cost-basis!"

m4y0mb,,investing,post,1615738368,"Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool ""AIMEE"" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and reducing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.

Some of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6

In a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&G, Unilever, etc.).

To put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become ""Super Heros"" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the financials:

Currently at the price of $35\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.

While the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&A targets. Direct quote from earnings:

*""We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&A targets that in total have trailing twelve month’s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month’s EBITDA of $97 million.""*

These deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.

 I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.

&#x200B;

It is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:

1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them
2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution
3. Competitors

For the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.

On the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.

To the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.

m4ghin,,investing,post,1615672644,"Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

[https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc](https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc) 

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

m497ai,gqtez9n,investing,comment,1615657029,"Another pre-revenue EV maker taking the back door to the market ends up being a fraud.  Lordstown seemed extra suspicious to me.

They claim that they're targeting fleets, yet:

* The truck has exactly one trim, despite their claim that production is months away.  Fleet vehicles need to be endlessly customizable, and the endurance just isn't.
* It has a claimed 600 hp; only option.  ""Let's hand a vehicle 80% the power of a hellcat to our technicians.  What could go wrong?""
* Only AWD.  Added complexity, cost, and reduced efficiency, and not needed in all circumstances.  2WD option is a must for fleet vehicles.
* Hub motors off no benefit beyond increased space for body customization... which they don't appear to be utilizing.  Power transmission losses are miniscule.  Hindenburg mentions the downsides in the report.

Also worth noting the project was a PHEV before Lordstown acquired it from Workhorse, and they claimed they could re-engineer it into a pure BEV and have production in under a year.

IMO the specifications of the truck are designed to appeal to investors more so than fleet operators.  It's important to note that many fleets don't even use hybrids because they don't meet IRR requirements on the upfront capital.  They want barebones vehicles, even cost savings complexities (like hybrids) can be rejected.  The Lordstown truck is luxurious in comparison.

We're seeing a worrying trend of EV firms who took the SPAC route ending up fraudulent.  One has to wonder why companies like Arrival and Lucid -with $10b+ valuations- are taking the more expensive, less scrutinized route over an IPO...",

m4j5zg,,investing,post,1615680574,"A little while ago I read this article from the WSJ: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871)

The article talks about how since trading fees are so low, and it’s easier than ever to own one share, why not buy shares one at a time. It posed the idea of a mini-index fund that you could make just for yourself. *Rather than buy SPY, just buy one share of each of its components*. I always thought the idea novel when you consider the diseconomies of scale in the asset management industry. So I decided to test out the idea with backtesting.

\-I’ll be testing the mini-index fund strategy with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI)

\-I’ll be using DIA as the comparable passive instrument.

\-Using QuantConnect as my backtesting environment.

\-To simulate round-trip trading costs, I liquidate holdings at end of all backtests.

\-To further try to simulate real-world conditions, all backtests will have some excess cash, but not too much as if a real person was funding an investment account to buy something they already thought out. For example, if you want to buy one share of DIA at $286.00 you might deposit $300.00 in your account. Or if you need $4873.00 to buy one share of all the constituents of the DJI, you might round off your deposit at $4900.00.

**Limitations/Things I’d try to incorporate if I wanted to explore this more**

\- All buying happened at the start of the backtesting period. A more realistic scenario to mimic small retail investors would be progressive buying as time goes on.

\- Fees are based on the IBKR brokerage model, NOT INCLUDING IBKR LITE. I would like to simulate zero-fee trading, but the trick with that is that I’d have to account for costs associated with the sometimes less than optimal trade execution that is known to occur with “free” brokerages. And those costs are hard to measure.

\- I did not use a price-weighting allocation yet. What I would do next is see how an exact copy of the DIA would perform.

\- My Backtest period is not that long. Less than a year. It starts 8-31-20 because that is the date when the DJI components last changed and ends on 3-13-21. If I wanted to spend some money on a data source that provides constituent information on indices, I could make the backtest period longer. There are ways to get that info without paying, but I’m only an amateur at python.

\- DJA is very limited, I’d rather do this test on the S&P500. Once again, need a clean data source to do that without a whole lot of headaches.

&#x200B;

The Results

[Backtest 1 (Benchmark) - 1 share of DIA](https://imgur.com/WYlJjAt)

Here we have the performance of just one share of DIA. I ran a full backtest on the benchmark because I wanted to see the effects of fees and cash drag on performance. Since we dealing with such low quantities a few dollars from either of those would have a meaningful effect. So the number to beat is 12.5%.

[Backtest 2 - 100 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/aOl8qQ5)

For the first backtest I just want to simply see what adding some scale to the portfolio would do. So instead of 1 share of DIA, we have 100. Sure enough, we got more than a whole percentage point in return. Nothing too surprising. The new number to beat: 13.83%.

[Backtest 3 - 1 share of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/syP1yos)

Now we created a portfolio with simply 1 share of every DJI constituent. Its return is very close to the return from Backtest 1 which was 12.5%. I suspect that if you did this strategy with a zero-commission account you might actually beat the 1-share DIA strategy. By how much, hard to say. However, still would be a losing strategy when compared to 100-shares DIA.

[Backtest 4 - 10 shares of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/h2teIea)

Same idea with Backtest 2. I want to see how adding a little scale would change things. Sure enough, performs very closely to Backtest 2 – 100 shares of DIA strategy. Doesn’t beat it, but I suspect it might in a zero-fee environment by just a small amount. Of course, this is also the strategy that requires the most capital to implement just to buy all the pieces. So, it wouldn’t be the most practical strategy for most people.

[Backtest 5 - 1000 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/lVxwWnp)

Since Backtest 2 performed the best, I wanted to see the effect of even adding more scale, this time with 1000 shares. No doubt we have some diminishing returns. We were able to eke out just 1 basis point for an extra 300k of capital.

**Conclusions:**

Based on what I’m seeing, there doesn’t seem to much of a case for the Mini-Index Fund strategy. You’re still better off with just the proper ETF. Not ready to close the book on this just yet. Given time, I would like to test certain conditions that might have the Mini-Index Fund Strategy win at the end.",Mini-Index Fund Strategy (With Backtested Results)

m4qnp9,,investing,post,1615707348,"# Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $1.43 Billion 
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion.",AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader

m4cmv8,,investing,post,1615661573,"TL;DR: The digital health market especially in China has a huge growth potential in the next decade and Ping An Good Doctor is the company to go to if you want to invest in this market. 

**Who is Ping An Good Doctor?**

Established in 2014 and listed on the Hong King Stock Exchange in April 2018 **Ping An Good Doctor**, formerly known as **Ping An Healthcare and Technology,** is a health care software company. The Company offers a mobile platform for online consultations, hospital referrals and appointments, health management, and wellness interaction services. In addition, it connects individual consumers with health care resources. Ping An Healthcare and Technology is headquartered in Shanghai, China. Its parent company Ping An is the world largest insurance company in terms of assets and market capitalization

**What is the growth potential of the Digital Health market?**

The global Digital Health market is expected to witness a 37.1% spike in growth in the year 2021 and [thereafter will continue to grow and reach US$508.8 billion by the year 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/25/2133473/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Report-2020-Market-is-Expected-to-Witness-a-37-1-Spike-in-Growth-in-2021-and-will-Continue-to-Grow-and-Reach-US-508-8-Billion-by-2027.html), trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 18.8% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. Non-COVID-19 healthcare has massively migrated to digital platforms in 2020. From telemedicine to remote patient monitoring & management, new service delivery platforms have been adopted at lightning speeds.

The global telemedicine market size was estimated at USD 55.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a [CAGR of 22.4% from 2021 to 2028.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/telemedicine-industry) The market holds many opportunities to grow during the forecast period owing to the lack of access to care and rising provider adoption of telemedicine, rising consumer demand and patient acceptance, and enhanced quality of care. 

Especially in China the sharp growth for the online healthcare sector is expected to continue in the following years. [Ping An Healthcare has quoted industry](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) estimates in its FY 2020 results presentation slides, which suggest that the penetration rate of online medical services in China could potentially expand from 5% in 2020 to 16% in 2025. This implies that Ping An Healthcare's online medical services business has a long growth runway ahead.

**Why Ping An Good Doctor?**
**Rapid User Growth** 

The company [grew rapidly in 2020](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF). As of December 31, 2020 Ping An Good Doctor had 373 million registered users (+18% YoY), 72.62 million Monthly Active Users (+8.5% YoY), 3.98 million monthly paying users (+34.1% YoY) and average daily consultations reaching 903,000 (+23.9 YoY) with network coverage including 3,700+ hospitals and 151,000 collaborated pharmacy outlets in 379 cities in 32 provinces. 

**Good Financial results in 2020**

Ping An Good Doctors[financial performance was good](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year with strong top line growth, improved profitability at the gross margin level, and narrowing losses.

The company's revenue increased by +36% YoY from RMB5,065 million in FY 2019 to RMB6,866 million in FY 2020. In terms of profitability, Ping An Healthcare's gross profit margin expanded by +410 basis points from 23.1% in FY 2019 to 27.2% in FY 2020. Furthermore, Ping An Good Doctor\`s net loss adjusted for share option expenses and foreign exchange, was reduced from -RMB695 million in FY 2019 to -RMB516 million in FY 2020.

**Who is the competition?**

This puts Ping An Healthcare as one of the three major Chinese internet healthcare companies alongside Alibaba Health Information Technology Limited (OTCPK:ALBHF) \[241:HK\] and JD Health International Inc (OTCPK:JDHIF) (OTCPK:JDHIY) \[6688:HK\]. Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (OTCPK:PNGAY) (OTCPK:PIAIF) \[2318:HK\] is Ping An Healthcare's parent with a 38.4% equity interest, while Alibaba Health Information Technology and JD Health are backed by Alibaba Group (BABA) and JD.com (JD), respectively.

**Ping An Good Doctor profits more from the digital health market than its competitor.** [23 %](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) of Ping An Good Doctors revenue came from its online medical services segment (compared to 17% in 2019) and 47% of its Gross profit (+15 pps YoY) In contrast, Alibaba Health generated approximately [97%](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/alihealth/interim/2021/int.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of the company's 1H FY 2021 (YE March 31) revenue from pharmaceutical direct sales & e-commerce businesses, while sales for the pharmaceutical retail business (including direct and third-party platform) represented [94%](https://files.services/files/586/2020/1126/20201126070002_75568423_en.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of JD Health's 1H 2020 revenue.

In other words, Ping An Good Doctor\`s is a better proxy for the growth of online medical services in China, while Alibaba Health and JD Health are seen as plays on the country's pharmaceutical retail industry.

Notably, Ping An Good Doctor\`s online medical services business segment saw +82% YoY revenue growth last year, which was much higher than the company's overall top line growth and the sales growth of its other business segments. This validates my view with regards to the growth potential of the online medical services industry in China.

It is also noteworthy that the company's online medical services business led the improvement in gross profitability. The gross profit margin of Ping An Healthcare's online medical services improved by +12.0 percentage points YoY to [56.2%](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year.

A favorable revenue mix with an increased sales contribution from higher-margin online medical services drove Ping An Healthcare's overall gross profit margin expansion in FY 2020. In comparison, the company's health management & wellness interaction segment saw YoY declines in gross margin in FY 2020.

**What are the risks?**

**Chinese market as a risk**

While investing in Chinese companies you must keep in mind that even tough the state leaves many companies alone, provided they don´t get involved in politics, the recently cancelled IPO of Ant Financial serves as a reminder that the government can do whatever it wants. Changes in regulatory policies could be negative for Chinese internet health care player. 

Also, Chinese companies saw some red days recently due to speculation that the government might now be able to maintain such high levels of Covid stimulus. But this would only have a short-term effect on the stock. 

**Market risks**

Certain challenges faced by this industry are resistance in technology acceptance by practitioners and patients, high cost of implementation, and data privacy and safety issues. These factors may hamper the accelerating growth to a certain extent. 

**Company risks**

Even though Ping An Good Doctor grew rapidly over the last year it’s never been profitable. This is expected to change within the next couple of years but a longer-than-expected time for the company as a whole and its online medical services business to be profitable poses a risk.

**Is it a good time to buy now?** 

After ARK Investments Management revealed that the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF initiated a new position in Ping An Good Doctor, a $ 3 Billion price surge was sparked but short lived. Right now the price is back to normal and Cathie bought 1 Million more shares on Thursday. As this being a longterm investment I don’t think that there is a need to rush in the stock. I believe it\`s at its fair value at the moment and something to keep an eye on and on the Watchlist.

Edit: 

* [CEO buys](http://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20210304:nASXbSl4sh) 2 million (AUD)  worth of shares after earnings

If you are not familiar with the company, they are an Australia-based online custom print-on-demand marketplace, (selling to the US and UK/EU predominantly), which in my opinion was very well positioned at the beginning of the pandemic, which gave it even more momentum forward.

I personally use them both as a customer and as a seller and am well impressed with both the seller interface and the quality of the goods. I got super interested now that the company posted their half-year report (apparently they don't do quarterlies at ASX) , which is the best in their history. +96% revenue growth, pre-tax profit up 118%, went long after I read it and the price dropped

HY Report (Feb16): [https://shareholders.redbubble.com/site/PDF/6134ef6a-590d-40ff-a58a-2e8df3c4aca4/InvestorPresentationHalfYearReportandAccounts](https://shareholders.redbubble.com/site/PDF/6134ef6a-590d-40ff-a58a-2e8df3c4aca4/InvestorPresentationHalfYearReportandAccounts)

Also there seem to be some pretty strong things going for them. My favourite: the CEO buys shitloads of shares and the company will be added to S&P ASX 300

Here are my views on Redbubble

PROS:

* ZERO debt - £130m cash balance
* 36% insider ownership (before CEO purchase)
* CEO spends 2 million AUD to buy shares after Feb earnings report (1.6m on loan, 400k out of pocket)
* Record braking HY report, all I see is growth and potential
* Operating expenses only up 23% vs 96% revenue growth, so they are becoming more efficient
* Massive affiliate marketing that seems to have traction // I DO mean massive if you search for passive income on Youtube, I bet some of the top hits will tell you to sell on Redbubble
* Actually making profit // first year of profit posted in the report, 42m vs -2m
* good market interface for both sellers and buyers // with good quality merchandise
* great customer experience and reviews
* Still relatively small 1.6B cap, a lot of room for growth IMO
* CEO said they won't pay dividends but reinvest everything for growth

CONS:

* Price of stock grew significantly since the 2020 bottom
* You might be exposed to multiple currencies - Their base is in AUD but predominantly sell in USD,GBP,EUR
* Price slid after the earnings report and positive outlook from CEO (WTF?), maybe anticipation was even higher?
* Trades @ ASX so might not be accessible for everyone. Market sentiment might also be different

Morgan Stanley had been quietly buying up 5% for a Japanese bank from October to mid-Feb. Not sure if this has any significance

**Excerpt:** The economy did collapse back then, but the government did not blow its brains out on fiscal largesse. So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?

**Tl;dr:** There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade. 

**Additional lesson:** When multiple mainstream business publications are pushing the same narrative on their covers it often pays to go the other way.","David Rosenberg says there will be no Roaring 20s, little inflation"

I'm not prone to being particularly for or against, but this is starting to look more like snake oil to me, despite making money off of it in the past directly or indirectly. Please understand I'm looking for alternative perspectives, and thank you in advance.

It doesn't seem to represent a good value store, to which it's proponents then turn around and say, it doesn't matter, its not that! Nor does it permit trading like a currency, given its sometimes wild volatility (how much am I paying for that pizza anyway), to which it's proponents again reassure me, don't worry, it's not that! Lastly, the hedge against a falling dollar/failing monetary policy argument - I don't see how a system to replace a fiat currency but which radically benefits original holders, meanwhile removing some of the variability of economic policy available today will be beneficial, and I can already foresee the argument of - oh but 'the man' devalues our dollar with monetary policy right now as he sees fit, but so too does the volatility of the asset as it trades.

So if it's none of them, what exactly is it we are after and speculating on? To me it seems we are saying that we value the asset for the anonymity as a vehicle of transfer between two people and the ultimate conversion (and valuation versus) a fiat currency that it brings, and perhaps the 'trust' we have all along the chain. I don't think we can go as far as stating it is quicker or more efficient than existing payment mechanisms.

In so far as the current price, I'm not uncertain it's not wild speculation albeit some rather clever friends are completely certain of its future, meanwhile I'm not sure whether they are transfixed and mislead or smart and ahead.",

m43dkq,gqtdid8,investing,comment,1615656261,"Trying to learn how to adult and I want to thank everyone for their advice in advance.  My wife and I live in the US, are 36 years of age, have one child with a combined gross income of $220,000.  We both max out our 401K to the IRS maximum, have three months savings in a high yield savings account and just recently paid off all our debt except for our home which is at 2.875%.  After overhead and saving for our son's college fund, we have a few grand left over every month.  

We recently opened up a brokerage account which we put these surplus funds into so it does something other than looking for fun things that we don't need.  If we decide to travel or need to make a ""major"" purchase our plan is not to dip into these funds but rather not contribute for X months.  

Depending on how things go, we may use these funds to purchase a second home (rental) however if the market tanks, we just won't do that.  As such, we believe our risk tolerance is pretty high.

Right now our portfolio consists primarily of VOO (80%) with a little of QQQ (6%), DIS (6%) and ARKK (2%).  The last 6% are what we consider our fun picks (AMC, CNBS, RBLX).

Our plan is to keep this strategy, depositing surplus every month, into our brokerage account with 80% of it being VOO or QQQ and the last 20% between DIS (my wife's pick), ARKK or other stocks/ETFs that we might think are worth putting money in.

As someone that has been doing this for approximately 9 months, I am looking for any feedback that you may have.  

Again, thank you in advance for your advice.",
m43dkq,gqsfhi0,investing,comment,1615633877,"Need advice on portfolio weights. 

I'll try to clearly explain my question here. When people say i have 20% VTI, 20% QQQ, etc. Etc. When they are figuring out the weight/ percentage each positon holds in their portfolio do you figure that out including profits or not? 

So for example i am building my portfolio towards a goal of $20k. So when i did this i said for example i wanted 5% apple, sq, paypal and disney. So when i bought into say Disney at $190 (just an example) i bought 5 shares which 5 shares * $190= $950/ $20,000= 4.75% so while in the process of filling my portfolio with the other positons (since im not just dropping 20k at one time...) say Disney goes up to $250. So $250 * 5 shares= $1250/ $20,000= 6.25%. 

So now when i look at my portfolio does Disney hold 4.75% or does it hold 6.25% of my portfolio? 

The way ive been doing it is like this... 


VTI= 38% (7600=0) need 37 shares 

Qqqm= 10% ($2000=910) need 9 shares

Qqqj= 10% ($2000=$1427) need 18 shares

ARKQ- 4% ($800=$723) ✔ 3.6%

ARKF- 4% ($800=$766) ✔ 3.8%

ARKG- 4% ($800=$821) ✔ 4.1%

PRNT- 4% ($800=$794) ✔ 3.9%

SMH- 3.5% ($700=720) ✔ 3.6%

VTV= 2.5% ($500=$518) ✔ 2.6% 

Paypal- 5% ($1000=$1120)✔ 5.6%

Square- 5% ($1000=$1030) ✔ 5.2%

Disney- 5% ($1000=$950)✔ 4.8%

Apple- 4% ($800=$868) ✔ 4.34%

DraftKing- 2.5% ($500=$512) ✔ 2.56%


So basically i wanted $20k goal. So i figured out what % i wanted of each holding and then whatever $$$ amount that correlated with... then i found the current share price, divided that by the $$$ needed which gave me a goal share. Then i just have added till i got to that price. Obviously some of these are in the +++ and some are in the negative. So i guess am i calculating this correctly? Because once i fill these VTI, QQQJ/M positions soon i wanna recalculate my portfolio for a goal of $50k which is more long term (didnt anticipate getting to $20k so fast).",
m43dkq,gqsyefi,investing,comment,1615648120,"So I’ve been thinking a lot about dividend vs growth investing and I think I’ve come to settle on dividend investing as the superior option. 

My reasoning is that even during periods of economic stagnation or even decline, that you’re still getting that dividend. Sure, it may be cut a bit, but you’re actively getting “gains” when the market isn’t going up. Isn’t this preferable to a situation where with growth stocks you will see absolutely no return, even losses, during the same periods? 

Another reason is that if you lose your job, you can redirect your dividends to your checking account and live off of that without needing to sell any of your base capital. 

To me dividend investing seems like the better risk management move as you are better off in stagnant or declining periods.",

**$LYTS - LSI Industries Inc. - Ever Been to a Gas Station - Bullish**

**What do they do**

* Based in Cleveland, OH, LSI makes industrial and outdoor lighting systems and accessories. These systems include gas station lighting and display/control systems (touch screens); outdoor sports lighting; and retail lighting systems.
* All products are made in the US which is an important moat for those sectors that require a Made in America designation such as federal contracts.
* The company was founded in 1976 and has grown through acquisitions to offer a broad and complete range of products and services for illumination and branding. As infrastructure spending increases and new developments flourish, both direct uses in retail and sports spaces and ancillary uses in gas stations/road stops will bolster LSI’s business.

**Why is it a good company**

* Improved margins last four quarters
* Doubled ROA and ROE YoY
* High OCF to Earnings ratio; real cash, not accounting
* Earnings growth QoQ; 100% increase YoY
* Decreased debt last eight quarters; debt coverage increased YoY
* Book equity has increased eight straight quarters.
* Enterprise value is less than the market cap

**Why is it a good stock**

* Greater than 90% free float; largest owner at \~8.5%
* Second quartile for momentum/price change: it’s rising but not topping at the moment
* Higher div yield than peers; in line with SPY
* 3 year smoothed FCF yield is 11.5% > WACC: good value looking at a longer time horizon
* P/B lower than peers with better fundamental improvement compared to peers

**What now**

* Long $LYTS with a PT of 12.5; EV/FCF based at 16x T12 FCF
* Write July calls at 12.50, IV = 48% on the bid

**What are you not telling me**

* Pretty low volume: 90 day average = 106k
* New management in the last 3 years might not have navigated the company through a full market cycle
* A slow down in infrastructure spending would negatively impact their profitability

m3zeuv,gqstklc,investing,comment,1615645214,"Interesting company thanks for the write-up. I looked briefly at the company and not seeing the 100% increase in earnings you noted - Q2 2020 is $0.07 vs Q2 2021 $0.09, am I missing something?  Regardless, I think their contract for drive-thru illuminated signs for QSR is a major win with most QSR I follow looking to expand substantially particularly thru a drive thru model. Coupled with the tailwinds from the inventory build likely needed in their distribution channel post-COVID drawdown I think earnings could grow more than anticipated. Additionally, they seem to be selling down assets - sold their North Canton and New Windsor facilities - These were outright sales but assuming they did sale-leasebacks of their existing owned real estate portfolio at a 6% cap rate and renting at $6/sq. ft. they could unlock about $2/share in value less the $0.12/share in annual rent.

Basically I heard about the importance of the bond yield rate recently and it sounded quite important. Then I heard about the auction happening on Wednesday and that sounded like it could have consequences, good or bad. From what I understand, the auction was able to sell bonds and thus the yield rate didn’t raise much at all. Then I was like “ok cool that’s over with.” 

But today I am on my yahoo finance app and just happen to see TNX as one of the suggested/trending/whatever items. TNX is the 10 year treasury indicator (idk if it’s a stock or a index or what). And I see that it’s at 1.626 which is higher than it closed at from the auction on Wednesday (1.52 or something). So why did it jump up again? I thought it was supposed to be steady after the auction on Wednesday kind of set things in place. Does it matter really?",Treasury yields rose again

For the same reasons stocks move up and down without major news. Bonds are more or less traded like stocks, and when there is more sellers than buyers the yields go up.

That's different than the federal fund rate, which only moves when the fed decides to change it. This rate has an effect on the bonds market, and that effect is so strong that bond traders will price in the changes they expect the fed to make

What we're seeing these days is bond traders expecting the fed to raise the rates sooner than expected, so they're pricing in that change when they trade bonds and thus yields are going up.",

""Renault announced on Friday that it had successfully sold its entire  ownership stake in Mercedes-Benz-owner, reaping €1.14 billion ($1.4  billion) from nearly 16.5 million shares sold at €69.50 per share. The  sale represents 1.54% of Daimler’s share capital sold at a near 4%  discount, based on the stock price at the close on Thursday.

UBS upgraded Renault from neutral to buy on March 2 and increased the  12-month target price on the stock from €22 to €54. Based on the share  price on Friday, this means the stock has legs to climb nearly 37%  higher, according to UBS.

Should the stock market come to appreciate Renault’s EV strategy, UBS  said, this could trigger a rerating of the stock from between double the  current rating to six times the current rating, depending on the  valuation metric used.

The company has “all the tools to sell competitive EV products in a cost  efficient manner,” the analysts said, with its design platform on par  with market-leader Volkswagen’s. In addition, UBS said that a key  differentiator for Renault compared with other manufacturers is that the  company is past its research and development peak, with a  fully-dedicated EV platform already built.""",Renault has new cash for a strategy that could make it an undervalued EV play

m33vsq,,investing,post,1615505619," I know there have been a lot of posts about NOK recently across several different subreddits, but I recently did some due diligence on the the stock and wanted to share my findings.

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.",Full Diligence Post on Nokia (NOK) Ahead of Capital Markets Day next Thursday (3/18)

m3qhl9,,investing,post,1615581269,"Canadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.""

""This project applies unique and made-in-Ontario Artificial Intelligence technology that offers increased safety and efficiency, with a reduced carbon footprint, to the goods supply chains on which we all rely,"" said Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This is the latest example of how Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network acts as a catalyst, fostering partnerships between ambitious technology start-ups and industry to develop and commercialize next generation transportation technologies that strengthen our economy and benefit society.""

""The trucks are currently transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution centre in the Greater Toronto Area and nearby rail terminals within a 12.5 mile radius, and early results are promising"" said Raghavender Sahdev, CEO of NuPort Robotics. ""The aim of the project is to develop a system that incorporates an autopilot feature for conventional trucks with a driver, leading to the most efficient way to drive and increase safety. The sensors work as a ‘safety cocoon' to cover blind spots and prevent accidents and the end result is peak fuel efficiency, meaning lower carbon emissions, and peak driving performance for an overall more optimal transportation experience.""

NuPort Robotic's approach to autonomous trucking is unique in the industry because it focuses only on solving the middle mile challenge, using a known set of predetermined trucking routes that are repetitive and high frequency as opposed to general highway driving. Ultimately, when implemented on fixed routes in the future, Canadian Tire will benefit from faster commercial deployments and improvements in supply chain sustainability.

""Canadian Tire embraces innovation and is always testing new technologies to improve our operational efficiency and safety. As proud Canadian companies, the safety of all stakeholders, including drivers, employees, customers, and public will be the top priority as we work together towards deployment of this technology,"" said Gary Fast, Vice-President of Transportation, Canadian Tire.

""Over the last three years, Canadian Tire has made a significant effort to solve complex business problems by using the Canadian start-up Artificial Intelligence ecosystem, and NuPort Robotics exemplifies what we look for in a start-up with a focus on innovation, automation and artificial intelligence,"" added Cari Covent, Vice President of Intelligent Automation, Canadian Tire.

**What is** **Daré** **Bio?**

Daré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s health. The company’s mission is to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility.

**Why this stock hit my radar/why you should care:**

Daré just recently announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of a one-time treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The treatment, DARE-BV1, received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and, based on the topline results of the trial, Daré said it planned to file a new drug application in the first half of 2021. This has further attracted analysts and larger investors to keep their eyes on Daré in the upcoming months as it could be used massively later in 2021.

The condition affects approximately 21 million women in the United States, usually in their reproductive years, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352279). The condition, which generally doesn’t cause complications, can, however, lead to preterm birth or increase the risk of infertility due to infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes.

**Products in the Pipeline: (Information here is quoted directly from the company's website)**

***Ovaprene*** **(CURRENTLY OBSERVING DATA FROM PHASE 3)**

Ovaprene is a hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive designed to provide contraception over multiple weeks by releasing a locally acting agent which impedes sperm motility, coupled with a unique knitted polymer barrier that physically blocks sperm from entering the cervical canal. The novel combination of these complementary approaches has the potential to produce efficacy consistent with existing short-acting hormone birth control options (pills, patches, vaginal ring), without the use of hormones.

In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.

**NOTES FOR THIS ONE:**

THIS PRODUCT IS HUGE IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL. I cannot express how many women struggle due to contraceptives altering their hormones. Birth control medications ranging from pills to IUDS alter women's hormones causing a laundry list of issues such as weight gain, health complications, and mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc.). If this product is successful, it will be the FIRST in women's contraception to create a product like this that can be administered monthly for women. There is only one other product that really exists that women can use for hormone-free contraception, and that is a specific type of an IUD. HOWEVER, IUDs are EXTREMELY painful, and I am sure many women will prefer Ovaprene as it is additionally self-administered.

***SILDENAFIL CREAM*** **(CURRENTLY IN PHASE 2b CLINICAL TRIALS)**

Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is the inability to reach or maintain a sufficient physical response to sexual stimulation. An estimated 16% of women ages 21 to 60, or approximately 10 million women in the U.S., are distressed from experiencing symptoms of low or no sexual arousal and are seeking a solution to improve their condition. To put the market opportunity for an FDA-approved FSAD treatment in context, the prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction (ED) in men is estimated to be about 5% of men at age 40, increasing to about 15% at age 70.

Still, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for FSAD. Orally administered sildenafil received FDA approval in 1998 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and is marketed under the brand name Viagra®. Given the underlying pathophysiologic similarities of ED and FSAD, using sildenafil to direct blood to the genitals before sexual activity could provide a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience for women as it does in men.

Our localized, proprietary formulation of sildenafil cream, 3.6% (topical cream, sildenafil), has been designed specifically for women. The targeted application of this cream to the genital tissue is designed to increase local blood flow without the associated systemic exposure and side effects, leading to an improvement in overall sexual experience and response.

***DARE-BV1*** **(SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PHASE 3 TRIALS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS)**

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common type of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. In the U.S. alone, bacterial vaginosis is estimated to affect approximately 21 million women. While there are several orally and vaginally delivered therapeutic interventions indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, currently approved options in the U.S. have relatively insufficient clinical cure rates, require sequential daily administrations or can be otherwise inconvenient for women to use.

DARE-BV1 is a thermosetting vaginal gel formulated with clindamycin phosphate 2% designed for prolonged, localized release of the antibiotic.

**Upcoming Products:**

I'm going to be quite honest here, there are a TON of diverse products that this company is currently working on to counter sexual disorders and health complications involving sexual activity. They are additionally looking into contraceptives for Males as well. This company currently has many of these products in the pre-trials stage, but they are committed to continuing research for the benefit of people's health.

**Previous Drop in Price:**

One thing I think many people will look at and question is the 5-year chart for Daré; this stock used to trade at $33/share back in 2017. However, after the acquisition of another company known as Cerulean, Daré conducted a 10 to 1 reverse split which I think additionally scared off investors. Not to mention, COVID additionally further spiked the price down along with other stocks in 2020 as well.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

&#x200B;

1. On March 25th, Dare will announce their Q4 earnings (pre-market). Based on their positive phrase 3 clinical results, this is predicted to be a positive earnings call with further products hopefully entering phase 3 trials soon.
2. Dare is further participating in two upcoming conferences to debut their products to large investors.

&#x200B;

* Conference #1: **33rd Annual Roth Conference (March 15th)** \[This is the same conference that companies like *Assertio* will be presenting at.\]
* Conference #2: **M Vest and Maxim Group Inaugural Emerging Growth Virtual Conference (March 17 & 18)**
* Conference #3: **BIO-Europe Spring Digital (March 22 - 25)**

1. **Results for clinical trials on Ovaprene.**

&#x200B;

* \*\*Ovaprene is currently in the process to enter clinical trials which are already looking successful. The following is quoted from the DARE website: ""\*\*In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.""

Something to pull away from this is that they are spreading awareness continuously during this month about their successful trials and upcoming products. Partners and investors are their major concern at the moment, and this is a great opportunity for them to pull in potential partners/investors based on previous successes.

**My Take**

Dare is not only a short term investment for the month of March, but a long term investment under a Biden administration. Biden has stated multiple times that women's health is a priority with his focus on health care during his presidency. This backed by other democrats could be a major upside for women's health companies such as Dare. Obviously I recommend you all do your own DD, but this company has the potential to blow up over the course of 2021 with its price target being moved to the $5 - 9 range.

m3hspu,gqrh1fc,investing,comment,1615604600,"So I am a Dr

I'm terrible at analyzing stocks or individual companies.  Plenty of pharmaceutical manufacturers are big time risks, this one included.  So, while I can't comment on the company itself, I think I can talk a little about how successful a drug can be...

Ovaprene: this is basically a diaphragm.  This may be a hard sell for a few reasons...
For one, if someone is going to use a temporary implant, they want it to be out of the way, painless, and not to interfere with sex drive.  It sounds like it covers all of the above.  You listed the major competitors of this product with exception to the copper IUD.  Copper IUD's are the most effective contraceptive device on the market, AND they don't have hormones.  Like all IUD's they are initially painful when placing, but usually lasts a brief period of time.  The copper IUD can cause more painful or heavier cycles, but it rarely gets dislodged, as it is far past the cervix when placed.  The copper iud is more expensive than other IUD's, and honestly I don't know why.  So when I think of non-hormonal contraceptives that arent condoms or spermicides, I think of copper iud's.  This will likely be the biggest competitor.  IF it pans out that ovaprene passes trials, AND gets marketed correctly, AND proves to be effective, AND is more comfortable/less side-effects than copper, then I can see this product being a huge success.  But those are a lot of ifs...

And there's also nuvaring...  not sure how they are gonna sell against nuvaring.

Sildenafil cream: there are case reports here and there of women who accidentally took their husbands viagra.  short answer: its been prescribed as an off label use for hypoactive sex drive, but it is not FDA approved.  Flibanserin/Addyi was supposed to be the big one: viagra for women.  It had 2 rejections by the FDA because of serious side effects like low blood pressure worsened by alcohol and contraceptive pills.

sildenafil cream: If this works as well as it sounds - this may be the most profitable product you listed above. 


DARE BV-1: this product has too many competitors.  I am surprised they are pursuing this given how easy it is to treat BV.  We used to treat BV with a single day of antibiotics metronidazole.  And a lot of doctors still do this.  Its cheap, and effective, and yea, the side effects suck (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), but you will be hard pressed to convince docs to use a topical antibacterial for BV if it ends up being more expensive than the $5 worth of metronidazole.  ADDITIONALLY, we already have clindamycin cream out which has been used for BV.  It resulted in antibiotic resistance and increased rates of re-infection. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15507930/


I question the viability of all of these products except the topical sildenafil.  I worry that this is a pump and dump honestly...

m3cdt9,,investing,post,1615533365,"New company listings are always exciting and I generally try to keep track of any big news surrounding unicorns. These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.


I made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I'd share the next 4 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren't too familiar with, so if you think you've got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!


Mine are as follows:


1.Applovin

1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. 


2.Vizio

2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn't have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We'll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. 


3.Nextdoor

Just going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There's not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. 

I am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. 

4.This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. 


There are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren't listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones that I'm personally bullish on and probably won't get as much attention.",My 4 most anticipated IPO/DPO's for the rest of 2021

I'm passive investor with 5% of my portfolio in Emerging Markets (index). I've been thinking lately that it's not really worth it to invest in these stocks. Emerging market economies may indeed enjoy higher level of GDP growth than developed economies, but their corporate governance is substandard, corruption may be rampant, and the rule of law inconsistent. The result is that much of that growth is captured by insiders rather than by the public investors at large.

While the market is undoubtedly aware of the problems and presumably takes them into account when setting prices, I'm not confident the market can accurately price in unknown information (for example, we don't really know what goes on in China). Emerging Mkts is pehaps one of the few areas where active management makes sense. Indexing assumes the market is efficient, that assumption may not be true in some emerging markets.

I feel index investors are better off focusing exclusively on the US and other developed markets where we will get a fair shake. Large corporations like MCD and Coke already have exposure to emerging markets, and unlike locally traded shares, their financials are not suspect.",Emerging Markets and Index Investing

m339dm,gqmx055,investing,comment,1615508805,"Macro economics and politics matter more than valuations in EM, but don't write them off just due to political risk.

With valuations so high around the world, there really aren't any safe bets anymore. You are taking another type of risk by being entirely in developed market equities. 

A bet on EM is simply a bet that things will ""get better"" rather than get worse. If China can slowly grow to be 20% less crooked than they are today, then financial markets should reward them with higher multiples.

If you are okay with taking on the risk of investing in EM, here are some options besides a market index:

- DGS: One of the two EM ETFs I hold. It holds small companies only, so hopefully less political risk, and screens/weighs by dividends, because unlike financial statements you cannot easily fake a dividend. 

- AVEM: A relatively new ETF from Avantis that holds a smaller universe than VWO, with tilting towards quality/fundamentals.. without making big sector bets. Yes, fundamentals in EM can be cooked, but IMO this ETF will lean away from market bubbles that are common in that sphere. The team managing this ETF has a pretty good pedigree. 

- Actively managed funds: Vanguard has a good active fund. T Rowe does as well but I believe theirs is closed to new money. My advice is to pick a fund that checks these marks: fee under 1%, low turnover, less than 500 stocks, manager has skin in the game (you can verify via Morningstar), and I would avoid anything that leans too heavily towards growth/tech. All the above matter more than recent performance. 

For the record, I am heavily invested in EM but I also hold $1 in conflict hedge for every $5 of China exposure..so I am loaded up on LMT, NOC, LHX, and EAF. If China ever attacks Taiwan all global markets will crash anyway though, not just EM.

Edit: the reason to not hold the full index and instead hold a smaller universe...is because IMO successfully investing in EM is more about what you *don't* hold rather than what you hold. VWO is forced to hold every single Hong Kong listed stock, and I'd rather have a screen for fraud/bs/shenanigans. You can achieve that screen by using an active fund or an ETF that screens on dividends (DGS) or quality (AVEM).",

I have managed to put aside 2000$, besides a 4 months worth of emergency fund. My objective simply was to save some money for a ""next step"", but maybe my next step should be investing, for the time being. (covid and all)

I'm 23 and live in Romania, had to move back to my parents from abroad, where I lost my job; I'm looking for one right now (i'm a cook, but definitely not want to be doing this forever). I don't have any debt, nor experience in investing.

I will dip my toes into investing and would like some opinions on how to properly diversify.

My objectives are not clear yet, but I'd like to have some returns on the short term (perhaps with something high risk, to learn about the market, stocks, etc. and try out crypto too), then save some for the long term as well (lower priority for this)

L Brands (owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body works) has been on a meteoric rise, hyped by investment analysts. It's in a classic bubble. Today the stock rose nearly 10% because the board revised earning projects and initiated a stock buyback. Not sure what factors have led this company to believe its earnings will be that good, when its business has been hugely impacted by the pandemic.

Stock is sitting at 61, last time it went above 60 was in 2017, and it dropped like a ROCK after that

At its core, the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business. It's based in shopping malls, which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline. Its products are not unique, there are many other brands and stores selling same cheaply made underwear. The stock has had an average PE of about 12, right now its at 18. Retail industry is in a very tough spot, L Brands does not have a strong e-commerce presence.",

m3eijz,gqoivzc,investing,comment,1615549846,"Good morning contrarians!

Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Technology stocks are selling off as bond yields are rising. Yes, we’re back to that narrative. 

As of 0620 Nasdaq futures are 1.6% lower. The S&P 500 is pointing to a drop of 0.5% at the open. Dow Industrials and small caps are flat. Commodities are lower: gold and silver down more than 1% and 2%, respectively. Copper down over 1% as well.

This all comes after the S&P 500 climbed to a record yesterday. Seeing how there is nothing else that has really emerged as a catalyst, this would lead one to surmise that the drop is due to profit taking. Though again, the fact that bonds are selling off as well is unusual.

Not much in the way of data releases today: PPIs at 0830. You’ll be hearing about the Michigan Consumer Sentiment but that is a backward-looking measure I have never found particularly useful.

m3mkc4,,investing,post,1615570316,"Sleep Number Corporation has a vertically integrated line of air bed mattresses, which it sells direct to consumers. The company also sells ancillary bedding, including pillows and sheets. Historically this has been overwhelming accomplished through physical retail channels, with 92% of net sales being derived from physical retail locations in FY 2019. COVID, however, forced the company to pivot to online, phone, and chat sales, with online/phone/chat sales increasing 104% in FY 2020. This allowed the company to continue its phenomenal growth, with sales increasing by 9% y/y and earnings increasing by 82% y/y during the FY 2020 period despite COVID.

This financial performance has translated into considerable price appreciation in the stock. Sleep Number is up 70% YTD (thru 3.11.21) and 265% over the trailing year. It outperformed its conventional peer, TPX, by 114% over the trailing year period and the S&P 500 by 219% over the same period but underperformed its less conventional peer PRPL by 67% over the trailing year. Nevertheless, the recent price performance has caused the valuation to move higher relative to its conventional peer and to its historical average. The company now trades at 22.5x BF P/E vs. a 5-year historical average of 16.9x BF P/E and TPX's 14.9x BF P/E and at 12.9x BF EV/EBITDA vs. a 5-year historical average of 7.7x and TPX's 9.7x.

However, the company does trade at a significant discount to the new growth competitors in the space including Purple Innovation, Inc. and Casper Sleep, Inc. PRPL’s 37x BF P/E and 23x BF EV/EBITDA and CSPR’s operating losses make SNBR’s valuation look deeply discounted just on the basis of their financial performance.

Despite the growth peers, one might still conclude the company is overvalued on a historical basis and a return to the mean is in order. I strongly disagree and think the company is actually trading at a substantial discount to its tangible value for two principal reasons.

First, the company's forward prospects have substantially improved relative to historical periods making a mean reversion less likely due to the present value of future cash flows warranting a higher multiple. Future cash flows should benefit from macro trends in the United States, particularly increasing homeownership evidenced by the MBA Purchase Applications Index. More company-specific, though, and differentiating it from its competitors is the foresight Sleep Number’s management had in investing in significant consumer trends within their space. These trends are as follows:

· *""First, consumers are prioritizing wellbeing – their own and that of their families, and they understand the strong link between sleep and overall health and wellness;*

· *Second, consumers are adopting digital products and services at a much faster and higher rate, and they are increasingly relying on digital health solutions; and*

· *Third, consumers have a heightened preference for brands that are characterized by authentic purpose and human empathy."" (Sleep Number Corporation 2019 10K)*

Identifying these trends allowed management to prioritize investment into their 360 Smart Bed and their SleepIQ technology, which they presented at CES in 2017. This has resulted in such innovations as ""Nighttime Heart Rate Variability (HRV)"" – a measure of the variation of time between each heartbeat, a datapoint which the 360 Smart Bed is able to capture. This innovation materially differentiates Sleep Number from competitors and appears to some degree to be driving sales. Iterative innovation could also drive increased replacement cycles amongst customers. The most important result of this innovation, though, is the unaddressed white space created by the dataset they are actively collecting.

Thus, the second reason why I believe the company is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value is the repricing from a well-run vertically integrated bed manufacturer to a technology company with a substantial repository of sleep data and a significant installed user base.

Sleep Number's platform captures 13 billion biometric data points nightly across the United States. SleepIQ leverages artificial intelligence on this data to better understand the quality of sleep and actively adjusts the 360 Smart Bed's settings to optimize for a better night's sleep giving tangible return for consumers. This data can also be linked to Apple Health Kit to be studied by the user.

The dataset gives Sleep Number a substantial asset akin to road data in autonomous driving applications deepening their competitive advantage. The application and use of the dataset could produce products such as subscription-based sleep solutions with reoccurring revenue, which the company could roll out to its substantial existing installed user base. A concept being discussed in the board room amongst the company’s excellent Board given Daniel Alegre’s, President and COO of Activision Blizzard, involvement and given the questions on the matter from sell-side analysts as recently as on the last earnings call (2/17/21).

In an age where data is increasingly regarded as the new oil, Sleep Number is woefully undervalued at 13x BF EV/EBITDA.",$SNBR Undervalued due to rich dataset from smart beds and macro tailwinds

m39uwn,,investing,post,1615523940,"Plus has received more than 10,000 preorders for its autonomous truck driving system, which is expected to be commercially available in 2022 in the U.S., China and Europe.

Plus, a self-driving truck technology company, has made several recent announcements:

The company will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) in its autonomous driving systems.A former Navistar exec has joined Plus as chief platform officer.Plus recently raised $200 million in new funding.

Plus was founded in 2016 and specializes in self-driving technology for large-scale autonomous transport. The company is starting mass production of its autonomous driving system for heavy trucks this year. 

According to a press release, the company will expand its feature set and operating design domain over time through over-the-air software updates. By working with the NVIDIA engineering team to further evolve its system, Plus will make it possible for trucks powered by its system to achieve fail-operational performance for on-road safety.

“Enormous computing power is needed to process the trillions of operations that our autonomous driving system runs every fraction of a second. NVIDIA Orin is a natural choice for us and the close collaboration with the NVIDIA team on a custom design for our system helps us achieve our commercialization goals,"" says Hao Zheng, Plus CTO and cofounder. ""We have received more than 10,000 pre-orders of our system, and will continue to develop our next-generation product based on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform as we deliver the systems to our customers.""

The Plus autonomous driving system is designed to make long-haul trucks safer and more efficient. Because of the size and weight of heavy trucks, which can total 80,000 lbs. with a fully-loaded trailer, they need more time to come to a stop and to maneuver.

Plus’ system uses lidar, radar and cameras to provide a 360° view of the truck’s surroundings. Data gathered through the sensors help the system identify objects nearby, plan its course, predict the movement of those objects and finally control the vehicle to make it move safely.

The NVIDIA Orin, which can deliver 254 trillion operations per second, can handle the large number of concurrent operations and support deep neural networks to process and make decisions using the data on heavy trucks outfitted with the Plus autonomous driving system. Orin is also designed for ISO 26262 Functional Safety ASIL-D at the system level for safety.

“Plus and its automated trucks are delivering true social benefits today through improved safety and efficiency,” says Rishi Dhall, vice president of autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA. 

To support the global deployment of its self-driving truck technology, Plus has added two new senior hires; Mooney, who was most recently senior vice president of global product development at Navistar and Chuck Joseph, who joined from Amazon’s Global Transportation Technology Group.

The company also closed $200 million in new funding in February led by new investors Guotai Junan International, CPE, and Wanxiang International Investment. Existing investors including Full Truck Alliance (FTA) also participated. Plus will use the funding to develop a sales and support network to help fleets integrate the Plus automated trucking system into their daily operations. The company will also scale deployments in the U.S. and China, and expand internationally to Europe and other parts of Asia.

Plus also recently announced collaborations with Amazon AWS, Blackberry QNX, and Ouster

* Shift is an online platform where you can buy used cars and/or sell your used car. Their main competitors are Carvana and Vroom.

***I've never heard of Shift..can they even compete with big players like Carvana?***

* Used car sales are actually consistently greater than new car sales in the US, and for over a decade, the rate of used car sales has been growing faster than the rate of new car sales. The total used car market in the US was $841b in 2019, yet less than 1% of all car sales in 2019 occurred on an ecommerce marketplace like Carvana or Shift. This is at odds with the trends, as more consumers are moving towards doing most if not all of their shopping online. This trend was accelerated with the COVID 19 pandemic. There is plenty of space for growth in this category for several major players. 

***What separates Shift from their competitors, such as Carvana and Vroom?***

* Shift has several unique features compared to their competitors. They are the only service in their space that offers free test drives at your home. If you see the car you like online, you can request to test drive it, and Shift will bring it to your door for you to test drive with no commitment to buy. They also focus on older cars compared to their competitors, specifically cars that are 3-5 and 6-10 years old. They also focus on cars that are less than $20k in price, with 40% of their sales being $10k-$20k and 16% being <$10k. Cars of this age and price range are the largest segment of the used car market. For reference, 1-3 year old car listings comprise 48% of Carvana's and 68% of Vroom's listings, compared to just 25% of Shift's. Cars priced over $20k comprise 79% of Vroom's listings and 27% of Carvana's, compared to 20% of Shift's. 

***Where does Shift operate?***

* They currently operate primarily in the west coast including California, the state with the largest number of vehicles sold per year, Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In Q4 of 2020, they launched four hubs in Texas, the state with the third largest vehicle market, in Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, with more plans for future expansion.

***The Numbers***

Here's how Shift's current numbers stack up against their competitors:

 Feature | Shift | Carvana | Vroom*
---|---| ---| --- |
Share price as of 3/10/2021 | $8.55 | $260.45 | $34.10
Market Cap | $716M | $44.8B | $4.62B
Total Enterprise Value (TEV) | $497M | $46.7B | $3.92B 
2020 Revenue | $195.7M | $5.58B | $1.36B
Estimated 2021 Revenue (average of analysts) |$445M | $8.7B | $2.51B
Estimated 2021 Revenue Growth % |127% | 56% | 85%
2020 TEV/REV |2.54x | 8.3x | 2.88x
NTM TEV/REV  | 1.1x | 5.36x | 1.56x
NTM TEV/EBITDA  | -4.41x | -563x | -16.2x

*Note that Vroom is down nearly 33% this month and is just now approaching levels comparable to Shift at its current price level. 

From the table above, we can see that by buying Shift, you are paying a lower multiple even when factoring in analyst's average estimates of larger growth (over 100%) in 2021 compared to their competitors. 

***Recent Earnings (3/09/2021)***

Shift has been growing very rapidly and shows no signs of slowing down: 

* In Q4 of 2020, they sold 4,666 units earning $73.4m revenue, representing 147% and 168% year over year growth and ended the year at $195.7m in total revenue (18% YoY growth) with 13,135 units sold. 

* Their margins have also drastically improved, with their adjusted gross profit per unit in 2020 being $1,350 compared to $811 the year before, a 66% change. This has been largely due to their focus in 2020 on building up their in-house recondition (repairs/maintenance) team instead of relying on 3rd party mechanic vendors, with only 14% of cars being reconditioned by 3rd parties in Jan of 2021 compared to 45% at its peak. 

* As they have grown their in-house reconditioning team's ability to process cars in house, they have invested significantly in acquiring inventory, and have increased their sellable inventory by 148% from December 2020 to March 2021. 

* As of Dec 31st, 2020, the company had $234m in cash and cash equivalents and $49m in inventory, with $312m in total assets and $74.9m in total liabilities. 

***2021 Guidance:***

* For Q1 of 2021, they are guiding revenue of $90m-$95m, representing 200-217% YoY growth. For 2021, they are expecting $450M in revenue, a 130% YoY increase and is inline with analyst's expectations, with $1,600 adjusted gross profit per unit, a 19% YoY increase, which is on track for their target of $2,500 in the next few years.


***Disclaimer*** 

* I hold shares in Shift and continue to buy at these prices as I am bullish on the company. Thanks for reading",Shift ($SFT) DD: A rapidly growing competitor to Carvana that seems undervalued

m2qd6k,gql9zt1,investing,comment,1615481906,"I agree with you that VRM and SFT are more attractive than CVNA.  CVNA is obscenely overvalued IMO.  CVNA has walmart margins and software P/S.

I think the more interesting question is what advantages do these companies have over Carmax?  Carmax will ship to my house for $100.  They also allow test drives and give money back guarantees.

Used car sales is not exactly a high margin business.  Carmax gets about 20% gross margins.  Carvana averaged 14% gross in 2020. Vroom hasn't even cracked double digits.  Maybe these E-commerce only firms can eek out a little more by cycle maturity with fixed cost & labor savings of over Carmax' online / brick & mortar hybrid model.

I still have trouble justifying the purchase.  SFT is slated to lose $1.50 a share next year with a book value of $3/share.  Working capital and Capex for expansion are huge in used cars.  There will be dilution before they achieve profitability, probably quite a bit of it.Vroom is in better shape, though their SG&A grew faster than revenue this year.  This isn't software.  Expansion is expensive and painful.

None of these firms will be able to achieve profitability with the equity they have today.  There is extreme uncertainty around how much of the pie you'll have when these companies do hit profitability, if ever.

Carmax is adopting the e-commerce model, they already have the infrastructure, positive earnings, positive FCF, and 1x P/S.  You get the potential upside of E-commerce market share without the risk of a company at -30% operating margins and no roadmap to profitability.

&#x200B;

P.S.

I think you messed up your EV on CVNA.  Their market cap is $46 billion and their total balance sheet is $3 billion.  No way to get to $22 billion.  Make sure you used both share issues, it looks like you only used their primary issue.",
m2qd6k,gqlgach,investing,comment,1615484618,"I'm a believer in SFT for a number of reasons that OP has outlined.  I've been observing the used car market closely over the last 9 months since I initially interviewed with Shift (corporate position) pre-SPAC IPO.  When interviewing, I performed diligence regarding the used car industry and found there have been major increases in used car prices (not to mention that many of the long-term unemployed are inundating the market as they seek cheaper solutions for major assets). Have been holding SFT and VRM in varying degrees (currently hold 203 SFT shares @ 8.81 average and got out of VRM position bc I deemed SFT to be significantly more valuable at current valuations in comparing offerings/tech).  Ultimately it's a great price point for a company with all the capabilities of the vastly more valued Carvana (and VRM to an extent).  I'd say conservative short term upside is $15 range (50% people, you heard me) and there is no reason it cannot continue to grow and take up greater market share long term.

PS tried to buy a used car through Carvana (would have used SFT if they had the specific vehicle I was seeking) and it was the absolute worst service I have ever dealt with.  Didn't get my car for over a month past the expected date so I eventually had to cancel after numerous futile conversations with Carvana employees.  Fuck those guys.",

They also seem to focus on the low end customer who has the worst credit and the highest rate of default, who’s financing these subprime auto loans?

# History of Nokia and Sentiment Towards NOK

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. The primary reason?: Turning the MASSIVE ship that Nokia is around takes time. Nokia is a worldwide company with tens of thousands of employees and over the last decade has been switching gears from phones to networks.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g)

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/samsung-elec-verizon-nokia/nokia-takes-a-hit-as-samsung-secures-verizon-5g-deal-idUSKBN25Y13J](https://www.reuters.com/article/samsung-elec-verizon-nokia/nokia-takes-a-hit-as-samsung-secures-verizon-5g-deal-idUSKBN25Y13J)

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s.

So why does this all matter? It matters because to IMO we are still at the floor. The meme stock frenzy or missing out on one 5G deal won't negatively impact Nokia in the long run.

Sometimes rightfully so, but the market seems much more willing to reward a new unproven company in an industry with a lot of upside than an established, formerly struggling company with new leadership and change in direction.

But the future of Nokia is extremely bright and it perplexes me that it's future prospects of growth have yet to be factored into it's price. Before we discuss that, let's take a deeper look at Nokia's Q4 earnings call.

# Q4 Earnings Call

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this? It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company (article below).

* [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/02/25/nokia-named-as-one-of-the-worlds-most-ethical-companies-by-ethisphere/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/02/25/nokia-named-as-one-of-the-worlds-most-ethical-companies-by-ethisphere/)

I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above.  Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

* [https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/nokia-shakes-up-business-org-warns-challenging-2021](https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/nokia-shakes-up-business-org-warns-challenging-2021)

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

Then why am I bullish on Nokia? For two reasons:

**First: I believe in Pekka.**

He just needs more time. He has only been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic and yet he has already made significant improvements.

* He trimmed a lot of their employee size fat:

* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

**Second: NOK is undervalued.**

We are in a bullish market and you may feel like your money is better spent in other, quicker moving stocks. I sometimes feel the same way, but I cannot get past how undervalued I feel Nokia is at its current price vs how overvalued so many other stocks are right now.

Their current market cap is $23 billion. So even compared to 2020 when they reported $24 billion in revenue, they are undervalued.

Factor in their future potential in the 5G market and they should be trading at a much higher price right now. Skip to my 5G section below for more info on that.

I am excited about all of the 5G deals they have landed recently and the massive upside to close similar deals over the next decade.

# 5G

So what about those deals, who cares? Also what in the world even is 5G?

This is one thing IMO holding back this stock. It's future growth prospects are in a confusing industry. It isn't sports gambling or electric cars, it's telecommunications.

A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is. I am not sure if he wrote this because of the backlash he got after the earnings call, but even so, I feel like it is informative.

* [https://www.nokia.com/blog/big-small-tech/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/big-small-tech/)

In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.

""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""

This is why everyone was very wrong in thinking that Nokia missing out on the Verizon deal was a big deal. 5G isn't only going to be used for large cell phone networks.

It has endless uses on a smaller scale. That is why oddly enough, of the deals listed above I am most excited about the ones like Port of Seattle and San Diego Gas & Electric. Not just because I am an American and those deals are easier for me to understand, but because they represent the infinite smaller opportunities Nokia 5G will have over the next decade.

Which is why I believe the below press release from Nokia is not being overly optimistic stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.

* [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/11/nokia-5g-set-to-add-8trn-to-global-gdp-by-2030/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/11/nokia-5g-set-to-add-8trn-to-global-gdp-by-2030/)

5G is confusing, but it is the future. I do not want to get into competition on this post, but it sounds like Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. I believe that trend will continue. I don't know a ton about Ericsson, but at a quick glance Nokia intrigues me more.

* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-loses-cellular-gear-market-share-outside-china-11615118400](https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-loses-cellular-gear-market-share-outside-china-11615118400)

How big of future will 5G be? It is impossible to know and all of the articles I find about it all relate to different sectors of 5G. But whether you read these three articles or find other ones, they all have the same thing in common: predicting massive (like >1,000% massive) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

# Catalysts

I want to be clear for this who may still think this is a get rich quick stock. It isn't. It is NOT going to the moon. Yes, I know people love linking Nokia's deal with NASA and honestly I've intentionally avoided mentioning it until now. It's old news and to my understanding it's only a $14 million contract.

Here are much more legitimate upcoming catalysts that make Nokia compelling over the next few months even though the main upside here is 5-10 years out.

* **Dividend Reinstatement vs. R&D**
   * I feel like this will happen at some point, but potentially not this year. Pekka said during the Q4 earnings call that they need spend more on R&D, but they are close to a time where they no longer have to play catch up. I think that is him saying yes investors will get their dividend back eventually, but we need to focus on improving the company first.
   * [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/investors/stock-information/dividend/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/investors/stock-information/dividend/)
* **Share Buyback**
   * A lot of people seem confident Nokia is going to use their free cash flow to buy back shares. They have done this in the past so it is very possible. It will not lead to an instant improvement in share price like some people seem to think, but it would be a good thing nonetheless.
   * A common bearish take on Nokia is that they aren't going anywhere due to having 5.7 billion outstanding shares. So perhaps a buyback will help change this sentiment. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.
      * [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proposals-board-directors-nokia-corporation-110000340.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proposals-board-directors-nokia-corporation-110000340.html)
      * [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/investors/stock-information/share-repurchases/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/investors/stock-information/share-repurchases/)
      * 2015-16: 1.25 billion shares bought back, 2016-17: 1 billion shares bought back
* **Capital Markets Day**
   * 3/18/21 This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&D decisions.

* **Annual General Meeting**
   * 4/8/21 Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but could lead to a catalyst not covered at the Capital Markets Day.
   * [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/company/leadership-and-governance/annual-general-meeting/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/company/leadership-and-governance/annual-general-meeting/)

# Risks/Cons

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock. 
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around. 
* FCF is used solely for R&D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly. 
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing. 
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict.  Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030. 
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.",Full Diligence Post on Nokia (NOK) Ahead of Capital Markets Day next Thursday (3/18)

m2o0p7,,investing,post,1615461775,"

Reported Q4 revenue number will lead to price moves of >+-10% over the next week. I'm long & leaning towards a double digit upswing for reasons below:
Consensus revenue expectation is $2.1 billion which means yoy declines in both total sales & same-store sales. What if the numbers are better than expected? Obviously there are bulls expecting a beat but what if (pardon my language here) the Q4 revenue beat beats expectations? 


REASONS for the ""beat beat"" 

Let's start with these internal facts: 1.ULTA makes 32% of its annual revenue in Q4. 2. ULTA current ytd revenue is only half of full year revenue for the previous year? Do you see where I'm going with this? Ulta's Q4 revenue for this year should be higher as customers haven't shopped that much ytd. (Relative to historical annual spend) ULTA will beat based on restocking and holiday splurges.

Now consider this scenario: you are Patrick Bateman and buy your cosmetics and skincare from ULTA Beauty. There's a pandemic in 2020 so you slow down on shopping because you can't risk catching covid in the store. As the year goes, you start ordering a few things online but not as much as you did in store (in person) pre-pandemic. However by Q4 you have WFH fatigue and you're now ready to restock all your face creams, shower gel and makeup. Gotta show Paul Allen you're still the MVP. You decide to order some essentials online plus it's Christmas so you add some extras. You then realize that you've only spent half of what you normally spend at ULTA so you also get Evelyn an ULTA voucher. 

Next we look at Sephora's numbers to test the beat beat view. Context: Sephora is owned by LVMH and is ULTA's main competitor. Sephora only sells the fancy beauty (Think Dior & Estee Lauder) the high-life nothing cheap. 

Two things to note on these numbers:
Firstly, Sephora's numbers are reported in the Selective Retailing Section of LVMH results. Selective Retailing combines Sephora with LVMH's travel retailers (e.g DFS - which you see at the airport).
Secondly, there's a date mismatch, Sephora year end is Dec vs Jan for ULTA, so ULTA quarters are a month ahead. 

LVMH reported a recovery in selective retailing from a low of -38% in Q2 to -26% in Q4 in it's 2020 annual results. Now -26% sounds bad but LVMH's travel retailers account for the bulk of the decline. No travel = no revenue for DFS. Travel retail accounts for 20-35% of division revenue so adjusting for the collapse in travel leads to improved metrics for Sephora. This means SEPHORA IS BACK! IT'S RECOVERED TO PRE PANDEMIC REVENUE. Sephora revenue is global but makes a good read-through for the US market. 


While we're on Sephora as an ULTA long I'm not sleeping well since Sephora announced a store arrangement with Kohl's which will be a long term headache for ULTA. Kohl's unlike JCPenney (RIP) has locations in US strip malls which is Ulta's niche. 

LVMH's numbers IMO offer the best peer comparison despite their opacity. It's tempting to compare ULTA with general beauty sales data but ULTA has historically had low correlation to general retail data and 2020 just made general data even less useful. When large stores like Macys and other department stores report lower sales this counts for most of the decline in market data which makes it hard to assess smaller players like ULTA. This increases the uncertainty in the Q4 revenue number. Good setup for option opportunities but I excluded trades as my DD on the ""beat beat"" view. Please share options strategies in the comments. [ULTA Financials](http://ir.ultabeauty.com/financial-reports/quarterly-reports/default.aspx)[LVMH Financials ](https://www.lvmh.com/investors/investors-and-analysts/publications/)",ULTA Beauty ($ULTA) upside in revenue & outlook when it reports aftermarket.

But actual luxury I would just go to a makeup counter in a dept. store. Ulta offers not only a healthy mix of cheap and higher end brands, but has a built in hair salon. Their selection isn't limited to just makeup, their brand and a couple of perfume selection. They have a wide range of styling tools, hair care products, skin care and as stated a hair salon, I don't foresee people running to sephora or counters to stock up on their needs before coming out of their caves to the world, but Ulta for sure.

I'm not extremely well-informed in this industry, but I'm fairly certain that this is just false. Sephora's pricing may be slightly higher on the average, but they're direct competitors for a reason and you can buy similar products for similar prices at either store.

> Travel retail accounts for 20-35% of division revenue so adjusting for the collapse in travel leads to improved metrics for Sephora. This means SEPHORA IS BACK!

Well....yes. If you adjust for the negative effects of the pandemic, any business is going to be ""back"" through that lens. I can't just say ""adjusting for every negative thing about this company, it's a good company"".

On that note, ULTA is up ~15% from pre-pandemic levels already. So that baseline isn't a great one in this case. It'd be better to discuss why they're better than they ever were, not why they're out of the pandemic because coming out of the pandemic slump is already priced in for them and thousands of other companies.",

Many speculated that 10 year yields were going up due to inflation fears and this was weighing down on companies where earnings are mostly in the future, aka most SPACs.

However, today's data not only reduces the fear of that inflation but it actually suggests that the bond yields might be going up simply because our economy is recovering faster than expected. This is a massive bullish sign and suggests stronger earnings from companies in the coming quarters.

I think what’s amusing to me the most is that you can directly observe market expectations of inflation in the TIPS spread.  So to your point I’ve seen a common theme of sentiment, both here and in the more clickbait oriented media, that yields increasing is indicative of inflation expectations.  But the TIPS spreads are almost exactly where they were a month and a half ago - which easily disproves any notion that the market all of the sudden started expecting more inflation.

m2cwjy,,investing,post,1615421022,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is exploring how it can meet rising customer demand to own and invest in bitcoin, while still staying on the right side of regulation, bank President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said on Wednesday.

“Client demand is rising,” Waldron said. “We are regulated on what we can do. We continue to evaluate it ... and engage on it.”

The bank recently restarted its cryptocurrency trading desk and this month it started dealing bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards for clients.

Goldman is also exploring a bitcoin exchange traded fund and has issued a request for information to explore digital asset custody.

Waldron said Goldman can custody digital assets “but can’t principle” them, and is in talks with regulators and central banks about how banks should be regulated when dealing with digital money.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is mulling how to regulate broker-dealers who are holding digital assets for clients and asked for public comments on the matter in December.

The pandemic caused an explosion in online commerce, as consumers spent more time shopping from their couch than in-person over the past year.

Goldman believes this trend will continue and that it will cause a corresponding “explosion” in the use of digital currency, Waldron said.

“The pandemic has been a significant accelerant,” Waldron said. “There is no question in our mind there will be more digital commerce … and (use of) digital money.”

I've included the entire list along with their national star rating. (Hint do a search for CLOVER, and youll see where it is)

CLOV itself is an adoption story - how can a doctor's office add adoption to yet another insurance broker? This is underestimated difficulty. This is not to be taken lightly - the doctor is already swamped with records requirements and they don't need a broker that's going to send them traffic - private practice offices are already pretty discretionary about whom they accept. 

The NIH grant is literally just a grant and a long time horizon. CLOV definitely can make some strides but its a super, super long time horizon.

m38nli,gqo2n6y,investing,comment,1615534228,How was Hindenburg hit-piece debunked?,
m38nli,gqnkvfe,investing,comment,1615521553,Its a growth stock so P/S ratio is much better than P/E when valuing it. Clover Health has a 3.5B market cap as of closing price and its 2020 sales were 673M. That means it is trading at about 5.65 P/S ratio for 2020. They did 46% YOY growth but project somewhere around 24% if I remember correctly and competitor Oscar Health had declining revenue year over year and 1/3 the overall revenue of Clover but are valued at over 7B market cap. I'm not a fan of the company or the sector personally. Big fan or Palihapitiya though.,
m38nli,gqozx9n,investing,comment,1615560295,"I've been meaning to research CLOV but have been lazy. If there are ~100s of competitors, I don't think adding 1 more insurance company is that big of an issue. One thing that I find interesting about CLOV is its ability to add value to the patient/doctor experience. From what I understand, they are investing heavily into healthcare data platforms to help MDs perform better. This is big if we see a trend of MDs being tracked by ProPublica et al. and will have to compete on outcomes, since then MDs will want to know how to improve. If MDs improve, then insurance company gains from improved outcomes.",

m254rs,,investing,post,1615401987,"""The online gaming platform went public via a direct listing, allowing current investors to sell shares. In direct listings, banks do not set an IPO price, like those seen in initial public offerings. Instead a ""reference price"" is used — which in this case was $45 a share. At that price, the company's market cap value came in at $30 billion, according to Bloomberg data. In January, Roblox raised money at a $29.5 million valuation.

Shares surged to roughly $70 just after the stock started trading around 1:30 p.m. EST.""

Yet the country was shut down last year. A ton of businesses went under. People are in crazy debt. Rent is not being paid. House payments are being delayed or can't be made.

Tesla is the only stock I wanted to invest in. I love everything about the company, what they're doing and Elon is a world changer.

If I invested when I wanted to I would be up so much already... Seeing as it has taken a big drop, is now the time to get in? Or is it inevitable that this bubble will pop? I have seen friends lose lots of money on the 2018 crypto bubble and something like that would be pretty shitty. Made good returns from my ETFs and wouldn't want it all to be for nothing.

# Report Overview:

**Bitcoin SV (BSV):** Blockchain gets down for business by solving key challenges and enabling new opportunities. BSV envisions a world where all transactions, digital activity, and data exist on a single public blockchain that functions as a global electronic cash system and a commodity data ledger for enterprise applications. BSV believes that achieving their “Metanet” vision, where data and value interact seamlessly, requires a protocol designed with base layer stability that’s capable of enabling massive scaling. Eleven case studies in this report highlight how companies are deploying business applications leveraging BSV’s unique blockchain tech.

* **Blockchains like BSV are enabling the next evolution of internet businesses.** Platforms like BSV offer a solution to many internet issues. They challenge tech monopolies by replacing centralized infrastructure providers with decentralized networks and applications. They solve payment frictions using digital currency to seamlessly enable an internet of value. They reduce global business challenges by reengineering the trust models underlying internet services using publicly verifiable, immutable, user- owned blockchain data and globally enforceable smart contracts. All these innovations open the door for next gen businesses.
* **Bitcoin SV has a unique vision and differentiated blockchain technology approach.** Blockchains come in many shapes and sizes. BSV’s February 2020 Genesis Upgrade laid the technical groundwork for advancing its Metanet vision. Genesis eliminatedBSV’s software mandated default block size limit (2GB) and thus allowed for theoretically unbounded scaling. The upgrade also restored certain technical features to the Bitcoin protocol that allow for more complex smart contracting applications and unlock the potential of BSV’s blockchain for use cases beyond payments. BSV’s development team’s efforts remain laser focused on maintaining a platform for enterprise use that is stable, scalable, secure, and allows for safe instant transactions (Slide 3).
* **Unlocking novel applications and enabling internet business model innovations.** Companies are using BSV’s immutable data storage, micropayments, and smart contracting capabilities to redesign how value is delivered to customers across a range of industries. Monetization for much of the internet today relies on data intrusive advertising or wasteful bundled subscription models. BSV’s key features could unlock the potential for fundamental internet business model shifts to occur by replacing the current paradigms with new user permissioned data, streaming micropayments, and other unimagined monetization models.
* **Bitcoin SV has a growing ecosystem of 320+ known companies & services.** This report examines how nine companies are using BSV across several industries: Healthcare Records Management, Supply Chain, Big Data & IoT, Casinos & iGaming, eSports, Web Browsing, Advertising API Monetization and Fintech & Investments (Slides 9 -18) It also looks at how BSV’sResearch and Development arm, nChain, is partnering with enterprises to help re-engineer their business models through its enterprise blockchain services offerings (Slide 19) and how the Blockchain Mining & Transaction Processing Company, TAAL (OTCQX:TAALF; CSE:TAAL), is professionalizing the way blockchain computing services are delivered to make BSV more amenable to enterprises (Slide 20).
* **Network stats are validating** **BSV’s** **approach towards enabling high volume, low fee, data intensive applications.** BSV’sdaily transaction count now regularly surpasses BTC, while its average transaction fees are orders of magnitude lower. These low fees enable micropayments and low-cost data storage applications. Given these low fees, median transaction values on BSV have been able to reach as low 1/100th of 1 cent on certain days (Slide 23). During a stress test, BSV processed the largest block in history on a public network that confirmed 1.3M individual transactions. That translates to a throughput level of \*\*\~\*\*2,200 transactions per second, thus highlighting BSV’s unique ability to offer high throughput in a production environment (Slide 22).
* **Bottom line: Blockchain has moved from the idea phase to the implementation phase and businesses are now deploying novel applications.** **BSV’s** **technical decisions to date have positioned the platform with the scalability needed to service certain high throughput, enterprise applications. Growing PoCs and enterprise traction will offer signs of** **BSV’s** **potential.**

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin SV TL;DR**

* Blockchains are delivering new business opportunities
* Bitcoin SV’s tech is focused on fostering enterprise adoption for scalable blockchain applications
* 320+ identified companies & services across diverse end markets being built on BSV
* Network stats show BSV being used for low fee micropayment and data storage applications

m24doo,,investing,post,1615400173,"I’ve been living in Korea for the past \~2 years (and am Korean-American) and over the past few months have been using Coupang to order products and food. I was mainly using it as part of my due diligence for the upcoming IPO but now I’m a loyal customer. Here’s my DD on what’s known as the “Amazon of Korea” (which I think is a well-justified title).

All information + data is from the [company’s latest S-1 filing](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021004212?cik=1834584) \+ from my own experiences. Company is set to IPO this week (latest [report](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/coupang-ipo-when-will-coupang-go-public-what-is-the-cpng-price-range/) I saw was Thursday, 3/11/21)

**A Brief History of Coupang**

* Coupang was founded in 2010 by Bom Kim, a Harvard business school dropout
* The company started off as a daily-deal Groupon type business but pivoted into an EBay-style third party marketplace that reached over $1 billion in sales within 3 years
* Coupang almost went public with that business model but decided to pull out of the IPO because Bom felt like Coupang was one that customers *liked* but not one they *loved* (pretty ballsy move imo)
* As a result, Coupang completely reinvented itself into an end-to-end eCommerce company and with the help of a $2 billion investment from Softbank in 2018, the company has now become a dominant force in Korea

**What Does Coupang Do?**

* Let me first set the stage by providing the 3 key values that drive everything that Coupang does: **service, selection, and price.** These values pervade all of Coupang’s business divisions, and I’ll be discussing the company within the framework of these 3 values.
* **First off is in my opinion the most impressive, and that is the company’s service**
   * What separates Coupang from its competitors in Korea is that the company has invested billions of dollars in **both technology and infrastructure** **to own the entire customer experience** from desktop to delivery
      * This is in contrast to some of the company’s competitors like GMarket and Naver which mainly offers a platform for merchants to sell items
      * Competitors are quickly adapting to Coupang’s business model but as of now, Coupang’s model combined with its scale is unique in Korea
   * The company owns the **largest logistics footprint in the country with 70% of the population living with 7 miles** of a Coupang logistics center
   * This allows the company to offer the **fastest delivery service in the country through Rocket Delivery** which offers the following services:
      * First, millions of items are available for either **same day delivery** if ordered in the morning or **Dawn delivery,** which delivers products to you by 7AM if you order by midnight
      * Second, **nearly 100% of orders are delivered either by the next day or faster** 365 days a year even before holidays like Christmas
      * Third, the company has been able to **eliminate cardboard boxes in over 75% of its orders** which saves the company both costs and in storage space
      * Fourth are **frictionless returns.** Instead of having to drop off your items, you simply leave them outside your door and initiate a return on the app which is super convenient
* **The second value to discuss for Coupang is selection, which I’ve also found to be very impressive**
   * Put simply, Coupang offers **more items than any other Ecommerce player in Korea** both for products and for groceries
      * I’ve personally ordered a range of items from Coupang like pens, strawberries, and tape but you can also buy things like TVs, clothes, and Apple products
* **The third last but not least important value is price**
   * First of all, Coupang offers all of the great services like Rocket Delivery and same day shipping through its **Wow Membership (akin to Amazon Prime) for an insanely low rate of 2900 won a month which roughly equates to $2.50**
   * Second, the company is **constantly offering deals for products** even for things like cell phones and Apple products
   * Coupang’s **goal is to offer the lowest possible prices** to customers and the scary thing is that as the company scales, its competitive advantage on this front will grow more and more
* **Other business divisions**
   * Coupang Eats is basically like UberEats and Doordash and it’s a separate app where you can order food
      * I get ads for Coupang all the time and from speaking with my Korean friends, it sounds like this is one area where Coupang has a lot of mindshare amongst customers but faces a lot of stiff competition compared to its dominance in eCommerce
      * As an investor, it’ll be important to see if this part of the business has a path to profitability and is gaining market share or is just bleeding money since margins are likely very slim
   * Merchant Services, which is similar to fulfillment by Amazon. Merchants can send their items to Coupang fulfillment centers so that they don’t need to handle inventory themselves
      * Merchants can also pay to advertise on Coupang which is another revenue driver for the company
   * Coupang Play is a streaming service
   * Coupang Travel which is like a Kayak or Expedia and offers travel deals
   * There’s even more the company is working on, but basically what you need to know is that Coupang has a lot of potential growth beyond just eCommerce

**The Korean Market**

* I wanted to provide some context about Korea itself from having lived here the past 2 years that is relevant to Coupang
   * **First off, Korea is incredibly tech savvy**
      * There’s free wifi everywhere even on buses and basically everyone in the country has a smartphone including my grandma
      * As a small example, Koreans were using their smartphones to pay many, many years before Apple Pay even existed
      * This is obviously important for Coupang because all orders come from online
   * **Second, as a baseline, Koreans work incredibly hard**
      * Korea was a 3rd world country after the Korean War in the 1950s and since then has become the 4th largest economy in Asia and 12th in the world
      * A lot of Korean students literally study from 8am to midnight from elementary school to high school and a lot of my friends who work in corporate work super long hours even without great pay
      * I bring this up to say that Coupang is constantly employing a workforce that from a general perspective has an incredibly high work ethic
   * **The third is that because Korea’s land is so small, cities are incredibly dense**
      * This is what allows for Coupang to operate so efficiently and probably much moreso than is possible in bigger countries like China and the US
* **Addressable Market**
   * As of 2019, Korea’s eCommerce market was **$128 billion** and that’s expected to grow to **$206 billion by 2024,** which represents a 10% annual growth rate
   * In addition to that, eCommerce spend on a per buyer basis is expected to grow from **$2600** in 2019 to **$4300** in 2024
   * These numbers are great, but what’s really astonishing is that even with Coupang’s massive scale, it currently **only owns about a 4% market share,** which means the company has a lot of room to grow

**The Bull Case**

* **First, let’s talk about the company’s scale**
   * In the entire country, Coupang is the largest e-commerce player, has the fastest delivery service, owns the largest logistics footprint with over 100 centers across 30 cities, provides the largest selection of products, and largest fleet of drivers with over 15,000 employed
   * Coupang was able to grow to its scale today after raising **$3.4 billion, 3 of which came from Softbank,** which has the largest fund in the world and it’s going to be hard for another competitor to come in with that kind of funding (though it is possible)
* **Second is Coupang’s tech because at the end of the day, Coupang is actually a technology and logistics company**
   * All that money from Softbank didn’t go only into capital expenditures but also a really sophisticated tech infrastructure that predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for every order
   * Each order shifts through 100s of millions of options for inventory, processing, and delivery options all within seconds
* **Third is an extremely loyal and growing customer base**
   * Some tech companies provide something called cohort math which is where you see how the same group of people have increased or decreased their spending of a company’s products over time
   * If you take a look at this [table](https://content.bamsec.com/0001628280-21-004212/cohort11a.jpg), 2016 customers took 5 years to triple their spending, while it took 2017 customers 4 years, and 2018 customers only 3 years
      * From using Coupang myself, I can totally see why this is the case. I went from ordering from multiple sites to pretty much only using Coupang now because it’s so convenient
* **Fourth is the company’s management team**
   * Bom Kim (CEO) - The company is founder-led, which I think is usually a good thing because they know the ins and outs of the business
   * Thuan Pham (CTO) - Former CTO of Uber (really great hire since Coupang is a logistics company)
   * Gaurav Anand (CFO) - Lots of finance experience from Flipkart and Amazon

**The Bear Case**

* **First off, the company is unprofitable and may continue to invest in new businesses that could cause severe losses just as when Uber tried to enter China**
   * The company points out as a risk factor in its S-1 that it may expand into other countries and I would pay really close attention to this since this could take away the company’s focus and cause losses
* **Second is the lack of shareholder voting rights**
   * Coupang’s CEO Bom Kim owns about **77% of the company’s voting rights** and also acts as Chairman of the board, so this guy has a ton of influence over the company
   * If Bom Kim starts underperforming for whatever reason or there’s some kind of scandal (abnormally frequent in Korea where there’s a lot of bribery and fraud), this could be something to watch out for
* **Third is Coupang’s valuation**
   * As with most IPOs, there will likely be a frenzy and the company’s valuation could get stretched very quickly, so this is just something to watch out for
   * At the top end of its range of $34 per share, the company’s valuation will be at about $58BN  

      * With LTM sales of \~$12BN, the company’s EV / LTM Sales multiple will by 4.8x (which actually would be a good price in my opinion)
   * BUT, there will likely be a pop and I wouldn’t be surprised if shares reach $100, giving the company a \~$100BN valuation and that’s where valuation will be a bit stretched (though long term, still may be okay)
      * Will be posting more about Coupang’s valuation after its IPO
* **Fourth, is competition which is a potential issue even for Coupang**
   * In November 2020, Amazon invested a 30% stake in competitor 11Street, which is majority owned by SK Telecom which is one of the largest companies in Korea
   * The industry Coupang competes in is very lucrative market so there will always be some stiff competition with deep pockets
   * I do plan to make another post in the future about Coupang after interviewing my Korean friends some more and will include a competitive landscape analysis when I do

**Financial Overview**

* **Revenue**
   * From 2019 to 2020, Coupang’s revenue grew from $6.3BN to $12BN, **nearly a 100% increase** (COVID did have a factor in this so can’t expect a similar growth rate moving forward)
      * Coupang has been able to grow its quarterly revenue from $0.8 billion in Quarter 1 of 2018 to $3.8 billion in Q4 2020
      * This was driven by a 27% annual increase in number of customers from **9.2 million to 14.8 million** from 2018 to 2020
      * There was also a 42% annual increase in spend per active customer from $127 to $256 from 2018 to 2020
* **Margins**
   * As the company has scaled, it has been able to improve its **gross margins from 4.7% to 16.6%** from 2018 to 2020
   * Coupang also increased its **EBITDA margin from negative 24% to negative 2%** from 2018 to 2020
      * Due to the increase in the company’s scale, the company is spending less on operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and what’s most fascinating to me is that Coupang **only spent 1% of its revenue on marketing in 2020**
* **Cash Flow Statement**
   * Company actually posted positive operating cash flow of $300 million (not much) but still, means the company’s core business is not losing money
   * With negative $484 million in capital expenditures, the company has negative free cash flow of \~$180 million but that’s essentially breakeven for a $11 billion revenue business
* **Balance Sheet**
   * Won’t go into this much because balance sheet will look very different after IPO

**TLDR:** Coupang is the Amazon of Korea. Growing like crazy and at the right valuation, a great way to get exposure to the South Korean eCommerce market which has a lot of tailwinds. Personally from using the service myself over the past few months, I don't see the need to use basically any other eCommerce platform for products or groceries. IPO reported to be this week on Thursday so good one to watch for.",Coupang (The Amazon of Korea) - Full Diligence Post From a Korean

m24doo,gqip98o,investing,comment,1615426712,"First of all, Great write-up. Been lurking this sub for a little bit, I think all your analysis have been really great and helpful for newbies like me. To add my 2 cents as a fellow Korean with some firsthand experience with the company as a customer, I think over 50B valuation is maybe a bit ridiculous for this company. For comparison, Ebay Korea, who has just about the same market share, is expected to be sold at around 4\~5B. Sure, Ebay Korea does not have many fulfillment centres, but Coupang's so called mega fulfillment centres are nothing more than just warehouses with a huge human labour force as well. Even Naver is currently valued at little less than 50B, and they are essentially Google of Korea with its own eCommerce platform. I think the recent news of the partnership between Naver and E-mart is also not a very good sign for Coupang. E-mart is the largest retailer in SK, and IMO, they are much ahead of Coupang in terms of warehouse automation. Most of Coupang's fulfillment centres almost sorely run by human labours. My cousin, who had a summer job at one of Coupang's fulfillment centre/warehouse recently, told me there was not a thing that was automated or done by robots. Coupang's entire business model may be good for the labour market, but not so much if what they are aiming is to become an Amazon of Korea. Coupang's Rocket Delivery service is also very convenient, but nothing groundbreaking either. The only real perk of using Coupang's service is that you can order super late at night and still be guaranteed to receive your package next day, but that is pretty much it. I just think that other eCommerce platforms are not offering the same service, not because they can't, but because they probably realized long ago that it is not sustainable. Coupang has only been able to offer that kind of service due to huge financial backing from Softbank to kill off competition which they failed to do. Most eCommerce platform pretty much guarantee you 1 to 2-day delivery for the most part due to the pure size of country anyway.

Overall, I think the initial valuation is just a bit too much. I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that this company is valued over 50B when the tech giants in Korea such as Naver and Kakao (Kakao looking to purchase Ebay Korea as well) are not even valued that much.",
m24doo,gqiaju9,investing,comment,1615418942,"As an American living in Korea I will say I'm bullish on Coupang.

The convenience is unmatched by any competitor.  I think a lot of aspects of Coupang can be used in ecommerce businesses elsewhere in Asia if Coupang decides to expand, however I don't think their model works in the US.  I wouldn't steal my neighbors returns from their doorstep here in Korea but I bet in the US someone would.

My favorite thing about Coupang is their CEO, who is driving the force of change.  That's why I think the SK owned 11Street will attempt to be great but ultimately won't be successful...They won't be able to get the passion that Coupang has.  I see Kim likened to Bezos or Musk where he has 77% voting rights because he NEEDS control in order to make it great.

• Sports betting is not included in the guidance and will be rolled out in Q4 2021.

• Very attractive margins from advertising. Advertising revenues now make up 12.2% of total revenue per user.

• The stock is priced at less than 12x forward sales (not including any sports betting revenue that will be rolled out in Q4 2021).

fuboTV is a rapidly growing sports platform that is disrupting a very expensive and entrenched industry. 

fuboTV has 169 million shares outstanding (including fully converted), which implies that its market cap right now is approximately $5 billion. That means investors are being asked to pay less than 11x forward sales for a company that's clearly rapidly growing.

Furthermore, we have to keep in mind that fuboTV's 2021 guidance doesn't include any sport wagering revenues that will be deployed in Q4 2021.

If you look far and wide towards other streaming platforms, there are not many growing their revenues at even 50% y/y. And those, such as CuriosityStream (NASDAQ:CURI) are priced much closer to 21x forward sales (once you account for all the outstanding shares).

Meanwhile, the likes of Netflix are growing at closer to 22%-25% y/y, but it's priced at about 8x forward sales.",fuboTV: A Play On The Cord Cutting Megatrend

1. WMT has partnered with Shopify. Thousands of sellers from that platform would join in Walmart Marketplace, which would help increase traffic and generate more revenue from fees and selling its own product.
2. Walmart is speculated to open some forms of banking service which will help bank the millions of unbanked in USA.
3. Walmart's partnership with Instacart and ThreadUp will help it create a dominating position in the online grocery market for the former partnership and a good positioning for high end clothes for the latter partnership.
4. Walmart's positioning in India through Flipkart was a genius deal in hindsight. This is only the beginning for the Indian market so we can expect huge growth in Flipkart. There could be a time where Flipkart could become the most important part of Walmart.
5. Walmart's expansion in Africa and China is also noticeable.
6. My own DCF estimates point out that Walmart is at least 10% off from its fair value, taking most of the growth factors out of the equation(mostly, due to them being incredibly hard to actually give a value) and using fairly conservative estimates.
7. Walmart+(recently launched) and Sam's Club could have a further good impact on its bottom line.
8. Recent venture by Walmart to launch a fintech startup shows that management is hungry for growth. They are also launching it just like a startup.
9. Walmart's management has shown good competency unlike most of the companies at this stage as a business. They are integrating various services somewhat like Amazon and this is very bullish.
10. There is the possibility of multiple expansion in Walmart.
11. Walmart is also setting up for more automation in its supply chain. And this will ultimately reduce cost and increase its margin.
12. Lotto ticket case. Walmart cancels its dividends and says they are focusing on growth and are a tech company.
13. u/JayArlington pointed out and I completely forgot to include this in my DD. Walmart is also targeting the health care sector. Walmart can actually prove to be a huge boon as it could probably reduce prices of medicines by using the various strongarm tactics it does with its suppliers. While this is nothing much positive/negative for us shareholders in the near term, taking everything into consideration, we will have to see how much Walmart will decide to push in this sector.


# Bear case
1. The various expansions and investments Walmart is making is very expensive in their very nature so one might say this is negative if they fail to succeed in their ventures.
2. Raising of minimum wage will also impact its bottom line(although I tried to take that into account in my valuation).
3. Redditors with huge disposable income may not like Walmart as a company because of moral relativism and herd mentality.
4. Also, as some users pointed out, they don't like the cluttered scenario of Walmart and Amazon's marketplace offerings. This is a very much emerging scenario where specialty online stores may have an edge over generalist marketplaces in certain cases.",Walmart(WMT): The upcoming $1T market cap stock

With CPI reported in line with expectation, or slightly below within some sectors, it does indicate that inflationary pressure is likely temporary and is driven by supply and logistic disruption due to the pandemic. In addition, with China PPI reported in line or slightly higher while core CPI was also slightly under expectation, further add to the idea of a temporary inflation driven by supply-logistic disruption.

US treasury 10 year offering today went well, with over $2.7 bid per dollar offered. And foreign interest bounded back to over 58%, just slightly below high.  

Its looking more and more likely that the recent yield spike is caused by dramatized media covering of the bad auction of the 7-year bills few week ago. Looking at the today and yesterday’s auction result, the demand is strong, and that’s taking into account that USD has declined about after a 8-9%. 

The reality is that the giant global government bond market has no better choice. US , is practically the only one issued by developed country that still has a positive rate. So there are only 3 options: safe bonds with negative rate, risky bonds with positive rate, or US bills which is safe but dismal positive rate. The reality is that, at the moment, US bills offering is still seem as the best out of a basket of crappy choices.","Looking at US CPI report, China’s PPI and CPI report, and the treasury offering this week.

m2v30h,,investing,post,1615482340,"Hi folks,

I have a hypothesis that the funds (and fund alumni) generally use big binary events as points in time for when they implicitly agree to deleverage and releverage their bets on trending areas. For those who need a refresher on the effects of leverage in the market, I'll quickly note that when you buy a call option, the bank who sells you the call option typically buys 100 shares of the underlying such that they have both exposure to the long side and the short side. In other words, they don't lose money if it goes up or down, they just make money off the spread and the theta decay. Lastly, the 100 shares they buy causes the price of the underlying to go up thus creating a miniaturized leveraged bubble. This miniature bubble building up and then popping is what I'm referring to when I say leveraging/deleveraging cycle.

To illustrate my hypothesis, the market didn't start going up after the selloff on sept 1, 2020 until the november 4th elections were complete (it was not entirely the vaccine announcement that spurred the upward movement).

Similarly, the market didn't start going upward from our recent treasury FUD selloff until the stimulus passed senate. 


I know these two examples don't constitute some sort of statistically sound conjecture, but I'm not claiming my hypothesis is correct by any means, this is solely just for curiosities sake.


However, if I am correct, then the real question people should be asking themselves is, when are the big events in the future that are considered boons for the market, and involve lots of uncertainty?

Stimulus is an easy one, likewise an election the size of our recent ones. However, what else is there beyond this stimulus?

I know that democrats have more reconciliation bills that they can pass, but has this been confirmed? Are there any other big bills in the works that people know of? Any upcoming big global events? Are there any large pending deadlines for any important central banks in the world?

In your opinion, what's the next big event?

Thanks!

edit: also would appreciate any debate on this hypothesis as well",the leveraging/deleveraging cycle and what the next big deleveraging event will be (open for discussion)

this is wrong on many levels.

1. banks are rarely market makers to retail leverage flow
2. this is not how you hedge your delta exposure, if a market maker is short an option theyll buy the equivilent delta of the underlying, its rarely 1.
3. something like 85% of all option activity is crossed, not delta hedged, and most market makers will only hedge their delta at the close.
4. if party A is long and party B is delta neutral then the delta hedge has no baring on the underlying supply and demand of the shares.
5. most leverage is traded through futures or on swap trs, not in listed options.  thats how most \*retail\* traders get leverage, but that is not how most of the leverage in the system is created.

the amount of leverage in the system (either increase or decreasing) is almost entirely dependent on interest rates, and the cost of borrow.  if borrowing costs are higher, then deleveraging occurs, if it is lower then leveraging occurs.  nothing else.  its like week 1 of macro ISLM",

Governments will need to continue to ramp up spending to guard national interests and security. Cybersecurity has been elevated to a societal level risk. Corporations will also need to spend a significant amount of capital to guard trade secrets, technology, and customer trust. 

COVID has also significantly increased digital work exposure with remote work. Additionally, corporations have greatly expanded their digital platforms during the pandemic, leaving their networks even more vulnerable. 

The Cybersecurity market has outperformed the broader market in the past year (past performance not indicative of future results yada yada) and is expected to have compounding annual growth of 10% through 2027. I don’t see any situation in which cyberattack frequency decreases in the coming years, and believe we will be in a full blown digital Cold War with China soon (if we aren’t already). 

I haven’t seen much discussion on this topic from the sub, so I’d love to hear thoughts , as well as any bear cases.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: Getting a lot of comments regarding individual cybersecurity companies. My thesis is based on broad sector performance, and I'm not planning on picking individual holdings. The industry is rapid-moving and relatively young, so the risk associated with trying to pick winners is high.

m1yg9b,gqg6c1f,investing,comment,1615387006,"Just a caution about cybersecurity as an industry. The whole ecosystem is textbook ripe for disruption and, speaking as a former insider, most of the offerings that are seen as truly cutting edge are offered by start-ups that aren't publicly traded yet. Most CISO's I know regard the cybersecurity offerings of most of the ""big names"" as second-class perimeter defense solutions that appeal to small and mid-sized companies that don't have sophisticated enough cybersecurity teams to know better.",
m1yg9b,gqhtqc5,investing,comment,1615411090,"Depends on how you want to define ""cybersecurity"" then

&#x200B;

* Red team exercises where subject matter experts look for threats within your company, and try to address them
* Information security agents within a company who organize bug bounties, paying crackers  (and not hackers, plz) for information
* Network providers who defend against DDoS attacks or packet inspection
* Software development teams who work with the life cycle products to scan the CVE vulnerability databases and see what matches within a company
* AI type of teams which look internally at software development and network traffic for unusual patterns
* Etc.

Cyber security isn't young, it's been around for years ever since we worked with RFC and understood that ""daemon"" as a username / password wasn't appropriate for UUCP.  Understand what area you want to examine or think is a growth is key.  

E.g.  Microsoft picked up GitHub, which is the premier open source hosting location.  This gave Microsoft tons of insight into the software development workflow of individuals, teams and companies.  Along with data analysis.  Subsequently, GitHub acquired Semle which is using CodeQL and variants for analyzing software (instead of of just searching for a string).  

E.g.  Palo Alto Networks (firewall products) have been doing packet inspection for ages

E.g.  Splunk has been doing the log forwarding for a while, even buying real estate in San Jose to expand

E.g.  Cloudflare which assist companies in fending off DDoS

Point is that there is no one company, team or product which meets all of the needs or demands of cybersecurity these days.",

m2bubi,,investing,post,1615418085,"
DISCLOSURE I own 10,000 SHARES of $FTOC may add more or the warrants in the future if price continues to decline.The 1 sentence conclusion is that at $11 a share $FTOC seems to provide a good risk/reward. Below I provide a more detailed explanation, the real version would take me 20 pages but this version is for THE REDDITORS!!!A bit of backgroundSo, in the past here I have posted about $COTY and $APPH but what many of you may not know about me is that I have been involved in the digital coin and payments space for the past 5 years and have been using Payoneer for years to pay contractors. Nevertheless, Payoneer is more than that. I understand that at first glance it looks like just another Paypal which is fine because PayPal has been growing and is profitable, even though it took a bit of a hiatus once it was owned by EBAY (Ebay was right to buy them but wrong to not let them grow freely as they could after the spin-off).Anyway, I see many possibilities for Payoneer that I think many are not being considering at all. Not only is the business going to be growing at LEAST 25% for the next few years but I think it can expand 35% to 50% per year for the next 3 given the massive shift of online transactions but also new services. To simplify, adding more services to cater their current customers helps them bring in new customers which nets them more revenues and profits.
Why a SPAC vs. an IPOThe issue with Payoneer has been that they never had enough capital to grow or to provide their customers more. It takes a long time to build a really robust and safe payments platform. Payoneer has been around for more than 10 years and it took a lot of capital and development hours to get to where they are today. The business was limited to transactional growth which is fine but when that is like a profit of like 0.5% (as most goes to the credit card companies or banks) it is hard to grow or ever be profitable. So, Payoneer for years has been in this stunted growth because of lack of capital or because they are in markets that were “high risk”, like not being in the USA vs. being in the Ukraine.There are many reasons they did a SPAC and if I were to top it off it is because they failed to do an IPO a a few years ago, capital is expensive via private transactions and it would never be enough. So, yes they could have done raises of $50mm every year but in this type of industry when you have so many competitors who have tens of billions of revenues and hundreds of billions of transaction volume you need a lot more to be able to compete. $500 million makes you a pretty major player in the game vs. struggling with small raises. Definitely not ideal for shareholders but in the long-term it is the best way to assure your business can compete at the very least survive.When I usually look into these stock ideas or analysis I go through a process but here on REDDIT I feel I need to provide a sort of cliffs notes because I can really go into a deep dive analysis of like 10 to 20 pages to really understand the entire business, how it makes or loses money. So I will to the best of my ability be concise but deep with my knowledge of the business.Business modelHere are all of the products that Payoneer offers its customers.Global Payments, Multi-currency account, physical and virtual cards, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable, working capital, merchant services, compliance and tax.So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business’ needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority.
Who are their customers and where are they know?
5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal’s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.What are the growth drivers?
Acquisition in new or existing markets (which drives better margins) and working capital for some of their customers (not all) which is what helps Amazon and Paypal grow their business. When someone makes a transaction say buyer and seller the bank or credit card companies make fees but when both consumer and business use Payoneer exclusively they avoid transaction fees with banks which is why these platforms push or provide discounts for encouraging transactions within the same network vs. out of network. Over time more and more transactions will be within network, just takes more people to be part of the ecosystem.What are the revenues of the business? Company estimates.2020 $346mm*2021 $432 mm*2022 $540 mmWhat do I think actually happens?2020 $350 to $400mm2021 $450 to $550mm2022 $600 to $700mmWhy? Because $500 million of capital allows you to expand faster than before and I think the management has been prudent not to be so aggressive in their esimtates because I don’t think anyone can believe they can so more than 35% a year but I do.What does that say about valuation?Well, Paypal at its spin-off inception traded as low as 5x revenue but growing 15% to 20% a year and when it had $11 billion in revenues now it is growing same rate but trading at 15x Revenue. That means that given Payoneer is growing double the rate and 95% smaller they can command a higher multiple but for the sake of being “conservative” let’s use 5x revenue as the TROUGH valuation and 20x revenue as the PEAK.2020 $346mm Trough is $1.75 billion or $4.60 a share. Peak is $6.92 Billion or $18.21*2021 $432mm Trough is $2.16 Billion or $5.70 a share. Peak is $8.64 billion which is $22.75 a share.*2022 $540 mm Tough is $2.70 Billion or $7 a share. Peak is $10.8 Billion or $28 a share.If you used my estimates it would be the following2021 $450 to $550mm Trough is $6 or Peak of $292022 $600 to $700mm Tough is $7.89 or Peak of $36.84Given the current price of $11 it becomes a 4 up and 1 down scenario, a good risk/reward bet.What do I think the future holds for Payoneer?I actually think there are several exits for this company.1. Company continues to grow and eventually reach billions or revenue within 5 to 10 years. So many factors and things that can happen since sometimes a 10x of revenue growth does not always mean 10x in stock price, could be -50% (due to massive dilution or debt) or 10,000% (no dilution, growth increasing, becomes a top 5 player). So consider that when you get too enthusiastic about prospects there is always a downside.2. Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.3. Wildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM’s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.Conclusion: $FTOC provides a good risk reward and many ways to play the exit depending on your risk tolerance.

Nevertheless, I welcome everyone and anyone here to discuss all of the good and bad about $FTOC because that I love about the Reddit community is how open, transparent and sometimes incredibly funny you all are.Good luck to every one!Value MaverickSource: https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdfGurufocus to view historical financials of Paypal.",Payoneer $FTOC is worth $5 or $35.

m1nu6b,,investing,post,1615345664,"What does it do?
Many investors in PLTR have no idea what the company actually does to make money. Putting it as simply as I can the company creates software for companies to analyse data and create simulations which help companies or governments make decisions which will help them strategies. For example they take all the data regarding COVID infections and help governments predict how it might spread which will allow them to distribute vaccines to the areas that will reduce the spread of the virus the most.

Financials
The company should be profitable either in 2021 or 2022. In 2020 the company had a one off cost of about $1 billion for stock based compensation for its employees. The companies revenues are increasing 30% year over year and the losses are decreasing every year. When it does become profitable the profits will increase rapidly. As CEO Alex Karp has explained their has been a wide divergence between the Revenues and costs which is typical with tech companies that need to spend a large amount of money in the beginning for product development and make large profit margins once they have a working product. The revenues are currently at just over a $1 billion dollars with a loss of $1.17 billion in 2020 however when you look at the reason for this it’s mainly because selling and admin costs aswell as research and development. Now what needs to be understood about the financials of Palantir is that although there is a divergence in revenues and costs there is not and with the product and systems they currently have there will not be a future a scenario where there cost of revenues are flat and the revenues increase. This is because the software has to be adapted to each of its customers which requires time and money. That being said the company currently has a gross profit margin of 75% and considering the average customer pays $7 million this is not concerning at all.

Technology or Consulting Firm
As explained above the company does need to personalise its software based on the customers needs and the cost of revenues are not flat however I don’t think you can reasonably argue this is a consulting firm. The company may need to personalise its software for each customer for its commercial clients but this is just an set up fee and from then on the company is making large profit margins. With its government clients I’m assuming their is very little personalisation to the software that is needed and they can simply input the same variable data that previous government agencies have inputted and run there simulations if they are looking for the answer to the same question for example what areas should we distribute the COVID vaccine to first?

The End Game!
Palantir is a long play for me. In the short term this company could go up to 40 or back down to 15. Any lower and I’m selling my house to buy as much as I can. But as Alex Karp said over the long term he thinks Palantir will be one of the most important technology companies in the world and its long term share holders will benefit greatly. This reminded so much of Jeff Bezos back in 1999 talking about Amazon’s long term view. I think Palantir is a great company over the long term and in 10 years time I think the share price will be at least $250 based on its growth rate.

I welcome any criticism of my analysis, I know it’s not a complete analysis but if I were to do that I’d be here all day. I think I’ve included the most important points anyway.

m1dxar,,investing,post,1615317536,"Let’s get the elephant in Spotify’s room out of the way first, namely Apple Music. While Apple is a formidable competitor, they’re second in the race by a large margin: Spotify sits at 144M subscribers and Apple sits around 60M (likely closer to 70M by now). Despite the services being available in roughly the same number of countries (APM:167, Spotify:170), **Spotify’s been able to capture much more subscriber growth thanks to a few aggressive expansions.**

&#x200B;

You’ve definitely heard of Spotify’s aggressive podcast expansions, including JRE exclusivity and new originals/exclusives such as Michelle Obama’s podcast. This expansion led Spotify to **surpass Apple’s podcast numbers just barely in 2020, with analysts expecting 41% growth in 2021**. Analysts expect that 53.9% of ‘digital audio listeners’ will be podcast listeners in 2021. Spotify’s continuing to expand in this space to meet upstart competitor Clubhouse, by testing paid podcast subscriptions that allow for interactivity. (side note, I’d be interested to know if they’re trying to compete with twitch here too)

&#x200B;

A newer expansion on Spotify’s part is their recent foray into audiobooks. It appears that they’re sticking to public domain works for now to test the waters, but moving forwards, this could create a real challenge to competitors like Audible, a company with an estimated $2.5B in revenue in 2020 and no real competitors. 

&#x200B;

**Spotify’s been aggressively pursuing developing markets**, which has a negative impact on financials in the short term but could lead to greater profitability in the future.  The reason is that they charge lower rates in developing markets in order to build a subscriber base and a presence. 

&#x200B;

Onto some quick financial stats. (figures in EUR) 

&#x200B;

**Spotify’s 2020 revenue clocks in at 7.3B, and a 47.7B mkt cap, which works out to a P/S ratio of 6.53.** 

&#x200B;

Personally, I like to value companies in the context of competitors … which is sort of hard to do for spotify. I’d argue Netflix is the most comparable (software, digital media, subscriber model), and their P/S ratio sits at 8.96. Twitter’s a bit of a stretch, but their P/S ratio sits at 13.5: Adobe, another stretch but closer imo as it’s subscription-based software, sits at 15.9.

&#x200B;

**Spotify’s debt/equity ratio is on a downward trend, sitting at 1.26. It’s got a forwards CAGR of 22%.** 

&#x200B;

The biggest red flag I see on their balance sheet has to do with their **cost of revenue: it’s been increasing almost in lock-step with revenue. Spotify’s very close to being profitable, and they’ve posted a profit for some quarters (though never a full year).** Spotify’s under good management, however, and I’m confident that once their more aggressive expansions mature, profit will follow, especially as they’ve proved they can stave off competitors like Apple. 

&#x200B;

On a valuation play alone, I’d argue Spotify is better suited to a **P/S of at least NFLX,** which would place it at **$375/sh**. With growth taken into account -- that the firm is estimated to grow at 22%, and is well-positioned globally against competitors -- I’d argue a more accurate P/S would place it **closer to 10 P/S**, putting SPOT at **$418/sh**. ^((these P/S ratios are gargantuan, but that’s true for the tech sector in general; my argument is that spotify’s undervalued in the context of the current market.))

&#x200B;

I don’t really do deep dives into companies this much, so let me know where I might’ve gone wrong in analyzing the company (especially if I missed something in the balance sheet).

Very good point that’s been raised by a few comments: Industry structure, namely big labels, might prevent Spotify from improving their margins enough to post profits. This is absolutely a risk, and one that Spotify could overcome in a variety of ways, all involving increased vertical integration. It’s also possible that this is less of a problem than it seems: I’d argue Spotify’s leverage isn’t insignificant, and that they may be able to keep contracts with major labels at current rates.","Spotify (SPOT) DD. Established company on the brink of profitability, trading at a low P/S relative to the industry."

m1dxar,gqd7dek,investing,comment,1615320028,"* Spotify's main business is selling subscription access to music owned by the world's three major record labels (Universal, Sony and Warner). These organizations effectively function as an oligopoly, and negotiate nearly the same per-song streaming cost.

* If even one of the three top labels were to pull their music from Spotify, the entire business would collapse because everyone who uses Spotify has favorite songs from all three. Users would instantly move to any of a number of competitor services that maintained deals with all three labels.

* This gives the record labels practically-unlimited leverage over Spotify. If Spotify's margin goes up, the labels demand a bigger cut. They have no choice but to accept or reduce the value of their business to near-zero. This means they can never reach significant profitability. 

* Paying huge amounts for a few exclusive podcasts does little to change this fundamental reality - will most people pay $10/month to listen to Joe Rogan? Probably not. 

* Unlike other middlemen tech services (AirBnB, Uber, Ebay, Amazon Marketplace), Spotify isn't selling product from small retailers, other small or medium-sized businesses or individuals. Their main business is selling access to product from an industry that contains three players, who have much greater negotiation power than any client of the above businesses.",

m2404p,,investing,post,1615399328,"Here's a recent article from one of the analysts that cover KemPharm.  In it they rationalize their $28 PT.

VALUATION

Our     12-month price target of $28/share is based on a DCF analysis using a     35% discount rate that is appliedto all cash flows and the terminal     value, which is based on a 3x multiple of our projected 2031     operatingincome of about $326 million. Our valuation is driven by U.S.,     Canadian, and E.U. commercial success withKP415 in ADHD, and U.S.     commercial success with APADAZ in acute pain. Commercial success     outsidethese territories with any of these assets, or any commercial     success with its other assets, would provideupside to our     valuation.Factors which could impede the achievement of our target price     include, but are not limited to: (1) failure and/orsetbacks of    pipeline  candidates in clinical studies; (2) failure of pipeline    candidates to  gain regulatory approval;departure of key personnel; and    (4) smaller  than projected commercial opportunity due to changes in    marketsize,  competitive landscape, and drug pricing and reimbursement.

RISKS

Clinical     risk. KMPH’s clinical staged products could fail to deliver     statistically significant results in clinicaltrials, substantially     reducing the value of KMPH’s product candidates and therefore our price     target.Regulatory risk. Even if successful in the clinic, KMPH’s     products could fail to be approved by domestic and/or foreign regulatory     bodies, which would reduce KMPH’s value and therefore our price     target.Financing risk. KMPH will need additional capital to fund its     operations, and such financing may not occuror it could be substantially     dilutive to existing investors.Competitive risk. For any current or     future approved KMPH products, they may not be well adopted in     acompetitive marketplace, which would adversely affect KMPH’s value and     therefore our price target.High stock price volatility. This issue is     common among small-cap biotechnology companies with relativelylow     trading volumes

Once again, it is time to acknowledge the absurdity of this bull run we have experienced. With so many people saving and enjoying the euphoric feeling of record highs, I can’t help but think this all seems too good to be true. 

Once the economy is fully re-opened, it will be interesting to see how much people are willing to spend and the impact that will have on inflation. Will it be a non-event like many experts are expecting? 

In my opinion, I think we are either underestimating the potential surge in inflation or a possible market correction. An abundance of wealth has been created this past year, unlike anything we have ever seen before. There are consequences to this - not saying it is bad, but when households are gaining 20% in wealth on an annual basis, it’s silly to think there is no cause for concern.

What are your thoughts?",U.S. household net worth rose by a record high $6.93 trillion in 4Q 2020 to $130 trillion. Inflation or a market correction is coming.

m2vpns,gqlr2jx,investing,comment,1615489215,"IMHO a significant part of this wealth is in house appreciation, or restricted access accounts like 401(k), or in the hands of the wealthy. 

Very few people will take out from e.g. retirement/education accounts to spend more. The wealthy already have the money, I am not sure their extra wealth will lead to significant more spending either. For the house appreciation, would you go out and spend more if your house went from 500k to 600k in one year? You can't simply sell and cash the extra 100k, since all houses around you have appreciated. Your best bet is maybe to take a HELOC, if you're dead set on spending.

Inflation might be coming -- it has been subdued for more than a decade after all -- but it might due to other causes (stimulus? reopening?) rather than extra net worth. Personally, I would not bank on anything more than 3.5% sustained. There are powerful structural deflationary forces at work. Stock markets, who knows, we might hit SPY 420 before having a -20%.",

m1nl5z,,investing,post,1615344884,"**Roblox IPO ($RBLX) Analysis:**

*I am no expert on video games or Roblox, but after some research and digging these are my thoughts on this hyped up IPO launching tomorrow.*

**Intro:**

***Roblox*** is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation. It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language LUA. 

*Roblox* is free-to-play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called ""Robux"". As of August 2020, *Roblox* had over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States.

**Key Points:**

* Valuation raised from $4B to $29.5B last February
* Anyone can be a content developer and sell their content for in game currency called Robux. Roblox takes a 30% cut of this.
* In essence, Roblox is a platform for gaming creators to make content, similarly to YouTube or an Apple App Store
* In July of 2020, Roblox expected to pay out $250M to its developers.
* From 2019 to 2020 Roblox experienced a 68% Increase in revenue YoY.
* Daily active users from 2019 to 2020 grew from 17.6M to 31.3M, 43.8%
* $1.62M per Day Revenue (ARP)/ 31.3M Daily Active Users (DAU) = $0.05/user ARPDAU
* Casual games on the App store have an average of $0.10 ARPDAU, so a Roblox $0.05 ARPDAU is rather low.
* Majority of their users are not paying.
* Net losses grew from $50M to $206M from 2019 to 2020, with an increase in spending in their infrastructure trust and safety, R&D and general administration.
* Free cash flow grew from $6M in 2019 to $292.6M in 2020.
* Average user retention is 23 months in 2019 and 2020
* Lock up period for Roblox is 180 days, which means that employees and insiders cannot sell their shares.

Overall, I think that Roblox is a very popular gaming platform for young kids that has a good social aspect to it. They seem to have increased their spending in 'Trust and Safety' which is hugely important for younger aged gamers, no one wants a weirdo talking to their kids on Roblox. Roblox has a unique business model in the gaming industry that allows its users to create new content. As long as Roblox can continue to incentivize its creators, it should continue seeing a huge rate of growth.

The problems that I see is mainly the ARPDAU number. $0.05 ARPDAU seems to me to be pretty low compared to other popular gaming titles, however I am no expert. What that means to me is that the Roblox team is not monetizing the game very well. Hopefully, that changes and they can double or triple the ARPDAU.

Another issue I see is that the users have around a 23 month lifespan, so Roblox will continually need to refill their active user pool. From what I can see is 23 months is less than some other major gaming titles. Roblox is suited for kids under 13, and whether we like it or not, kids grow up fast and might find Roblox un-cool.

Roblox doesn't make me all that excited to be honest, and I won't be investing much money into this company long term until I see an increase in the ARPDAU. However something important that isn't talked about enough is the  'Lockup' period. Investors and insiders can't dump their shares as soon as this IPOs so us, retail investors, should do OK buying it. Will I buy $RBLX tomorrow? Of course! Will I invest more than a few % of my portfolio? Absolutely not! This is to hyped for the numbers, in my opinion. When in the markets there is greed, be fearful.

The truth is, no one knows what will happen tomorrow with $RBLX, but it will be fun to trade nevertheless!",ROBLOX IPO $RBLX In Depth Analysis

m1nl5z,gqfe847,investing,comment,1615366030,"Just have to compare Roblox with other gaming companies and their mcap. If their valuation went from 4bil to 29.5bil in a short span of time, I do not like it at all, it is basically a money grab.

To put things into some perspective, ATVI (Blizzard) is 71bil mcap and they have plenty of franchise and have been around a long time. EA is 37bil mcap and have been around a long time with plenty of titles. Epic games has raised 3.4bil since its founding.

Anybody here plays Roblox? I am guessing a few or no. I know a kid that plays Roblox and his account along with his friend's were hacked. They were both paying customers and spending like 3 digits a month on it. Customer service was no use and they could not get any help in retrieving the lost items that took them over a year to accumulate, was the pet game with the dodo birds. Do you like a game like that? Ive been hacked before and items stolen in World of Warcraft many many years ago and I got everything recovered easily through customer service. Any adult that experience paying 3 digits a month and not getting customer service will be so furious, but the kids just let it slide and went back to the game. Then again the 3 digits were their parents money haha. 

I think Roblox themselves take advantage of kids not being able to complain a lot so they provide shit customer service to their paying customers. Buying an almost 30bil mcap company thinking to make more from it is such a terrible idea.",

m1nxdy,,investing,post,1615345946,"So what I've gathered lately from the market is that US treasury bonds have been selling poorly and thus the yield has been going up on the ten year bond. Something about investors won't buy it unless it has a higher interest rate because fear of inflation. Now that we're on the verge of signing in a 1.9 trillion stimulus bill, I have a some questions about the effect on the bond market.

* When does the US treasury sell the 1.9 trillion in bonds to pay for it?
* Does it do it in one massive sale? What types of bonds does it sell (2 year, 5 year, 10 year)?
* If bonds are already selling poorly, then wouldn't a massive influx of bonds on the market make the yield situation even worse?
* Are investors/banks prepared to buy it all up? Or will the federal reserve step in and buy the remainder?
* Is it therefore possible that the signing of the stimulus will actually hurt stocks in the short term due to bond market/yield fluctuations?
* Can anyone explain what happened with US treasury/bonds during the 2 trillion stimulus last year? Or the 900 billion stimulus earlier this year?

The Fed also still buys somewhere in the ballpark of a $100 Billion a month, so that should very roughly cover the structural Deficit of around a Trillion/year. Not sure about the exact numbers here, especially since the Fed also buys a lot of MBS (Mortgage Backed Securities). [Here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm) you can see that they bought roughly 2.3 Trillion in Notes, Bonds and TIPS and 760 Billion of MBS over the last year.

That said, any further spending has to either be funded by taxes or debt. In the latter case the additional treasury issuance will need to be absorbed by the market and/or Fed. I would suspect we will see a combination of debt and taxes in the medium term, and primarily additional debt in the short run.

Personally, I think the Fed will only step in to fund more than they already do, if yields go up too much. The big question is what the Fed would consider ""too much"". Yields might very well go up further, if inflation goes up faster than expected and/or if treasury issuance becomes too big for the market to absorb at current yields, since it's not attractive enough to buyers.

I’m staying aware that a powerful move down followed by a jump higher can be followed by a backtest to the previous lows or slightly lower. Stocks will likely rally further for a few days but may back test and shake it out late buyers.

Precious metals are in a similar position. Gold miners look strongest at the moment. It  is typically a good sign for them to lead. There could be a back test or undercut but they appear to be forming a short term bottom like stocks.

As I said in past posts a lot of action is dependent on the dollar if the dollar resumes it’s decline all risk assets will benefit. A move to 1.20+ in the EUR/USD would be helpful to this move back up. Significant technical damage has been done in tech and metals but I am still bullish on both.

m21i00,,investing,post,1615393844,"The European Central Bank Governing Council is expected to continue the hands-off approach to interest rates Thursday following its two-day meeting, but recent gains in sovereign debt yields have analysts wondering if the euro area lender of last resort is ready to up its bond buys in the weeks ahead.

“With Eurozone yields having increased meaningfully, the 11 March meeting is shaping up to be an important one for the ECB,” BNP Paribas said in a note. “The increase in yields poses both a communication problem – markets seem to lack clarity about the ECB’s reaction function – as well as a decision problem – the governing council needs to think about whether, and how, to react to this increase.

Analysts at the French bank spelled out their expectations for how policymakers will deal with the situation in the title of their note: “When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping”, which in this case means stocking up on more assets through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).

“The ECB will step up its PEPP purchases no later than following its 11 March meeting, we expect, in response to what it considers unwarranted recent yield increases,” the bank predicted. The analysts said specific yield or purchase targets were unlikely, but the council “will send an unambiguous signal to the market about its resolve to maintain accommodative financing conditions.”

Such brashness and clarity from the ECB may be a pipe dream as the organisation often thrives on life in the grey area. A case in point was the slightly hawkish shift at the last meeting in January, when the bank said, “If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.” There was no outline of how the bank defines “favourable”.

I have a question regarding selling replacement shares from wash sales. I wasn't aware of wash sale rules and currently have a couple shares of XYZ that are way more expensive than the stock will reach (300% the current value). If I sell these shares at a loss, and then purchase more of the stock, does the loss on the replacement share *also* constitute a wash sale?

The reason I ask is that I still want to trade frequently on this stock (every couple days), but I also want to dump those other shares when the price spikes. I understand theoretically why the wash sale rule exists, but it seems like it makes it impossible to trade with any reasonable frequency on securities.",

# Short Introduction to Leveraged ETFs

We all know that investing in a globally diversified equity portfolio is a great way to let your money grow. As long as your investment horizon is long enough, a diversified equity portfolio seems to consistently grant investors an (equity) premium over the risk-free rate.

This naturally raises the question of how we can further increase those returns. There are, generally speaking, two ways to increase expected returns:

* decreasing diversification
* taking leverage

Decreasing diversification will increase your exposure to idiosyncratic risk, which is not what we want in a passive investing strategy. Since this sub focuses so much on passive investing, I'll focus on the second method: taking leverage (i.e., borrowing money that you can use to invest).

There are many ways to take leverage, but the one I like most is using [leveraged ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp). Most leveraged ETFs try to replicate the ***daily*** performance of a certain index multiplied by a certain number. This implies that they re-leverage every single day. A disadvantage of this daily re-leveraging is that it causes *decay*. What does decay mean? Suppose that a stock experiences a return of -10% on day 1, and a return of 11,11% on day 2. The resulting return over the two-day period, ignoring leverage, would be 0%. However, when applying 3x daily leverage, the return on day 1 equals -30% and the return on day 2 equals 33,33%. In this case, the return over the two-day period equals -6,67%. The fact that the unleveraged investment returned 0% whereas the leveraged investment returned -6,67% is due to the decay. Decay, along with large tail risk, are the biggest disadvantages of leveraged ETFs.

# Historical Performance

So, now that you know about the basic characteristics of leveraged ETFs, let's look at their historical performance. Or at least, what their historical performance would have been over the past 40+ years. For this analysis, I used daily returns in USD of the ""[Wilshire 5000 Total Market Full Cap Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilshire_5000)"". The data starts at 30-11-1979 and basically runs until today. I applied the daily re-leveraging that leveraged ETFs use to the data. Note that I did not take any costs into account. However, as long as real-life leveraged ETFs succeed in replicating their benchmark, my main findings should still hold.

**Annualized Returns**

|Period|1980-1990|1990-2000|2000-2010|2010-2020|Standard Deviation (Annual)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Wilshire 5000|16,62%|17,59%|\-0,17%|13,28%|16,33%|
|Wilshire 5000 x2|21,22%|32,57%|\-5,19%|34,94%|34,94%|
|Wilshire 5000 x3|27,17%|46,47%|\-14,41%|56,34%|56,34%|

**Worst Daily Return (19-10-1987) & Maximum Drawdown**

||Worst Daily Return|Maximum Drawdown|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Wilshire|\-17,31%|\-54,44%|
|Wilshire 5000 x2|\-34,63%|\-83,06%|
|Wilshire 5000 x3|\-51,94%|\-94,91%|

I then did some tests using [rolling-window](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/econ/rolling-window-estimation-of-state-space-models.html) periods for 10- and 20-year investment horizons. I calculated:

* The median return over all 10- and 20-year investment horizons
* The chance of a negative cumulative return over the total 10- and 20-year periods
* The chance that the cumulative return for the leveraged investments over a 10- and 20-year period is worse than that of a normal investment over the same investment horizon
* The highest and lowest possible cumulative return for 10- and 20-year investment horizons

**Results Rolling-Window Analysis**

# Conclusion

As you can see, leveraged ETFs could potentially offer interesting long-term returns. The biggest disadvantage is clearly the high tail risk. If you lump sum, your returns will strongly depend on your buying point. To give some extra clarification, the worst results above are caused by starting your investment around the peak of the dotcom bubble. This problem could potentially be solved by making periodical investments instead of lump summing though.

The goal of this post is not to have you all allocate the majority of your investable capital to leveraged ETFs, but to start a discussion/conversation on the topic. I think leveraged ETFs are some of the most interesting but also commonly misunderstood investment vehicles out there.

I do believe that leveraged ETFs are useful for passive investors, **as long as they track well-diversified indices**. As previously stated, you want your idiosyncratic risk to remain as low as possible. The common rules that we all invest by also apply to these leveraged ETFs, but to a more extreme degree. Your investment horizon better be extremely long, you better not sell during a market downturn, you better ignore your emotions, don't try to time the market, etc.

Thank you so much for reading and feel free to let me know what you think. If you have any questions, ask away.

**EDIT: The data I used does not come from an actual leveraged ETF. I used daily returns from the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Full Cap Index and simply calculated what the performance would have been if daily leveraging were applied. The goal of this post is to spark a conversation about this, not to have everyone invest in leveraged ETFs.**",A Case for Leveraged ETFs

# Overview

""Proterra is a high-growth commercial electric vehicle technology leader with over a decade of production experience. The Company has designed an end-to-end, flexible technology platform that delivers world-class performance and a low total cost of ownership to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end customers. Proterra has three complementary businesses:

* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;
* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market’s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and
* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.

The Company’s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.

Proterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra’s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing."" Pulled from [investors portal on Proterra's website](https://www.proterra.com/company/investors/).

Proterra is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **ACTC.** A [press statement](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Proterra-Release.pdf) released on January 12th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the first half of 2021"". There is some speculation regarding the date; they’ve already filed the S-4, so the timeline for merger vote looks to be around end of March to April first week according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/le6yur/proterra_actc_merger/) and [the SEC website.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1820630&owner=exclude)

* [Form 8-K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-006284/)

# Financials and Fundamentals

**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

* **2025E EBITDA:** 21%
* **2025E Free Cash Flow:** $390MM
* **'20E-'25E CAGR:** 68% (Peer median 37%)
* **'22E-'25E Scaling Gross Margins:** 13-25% (Peer median 23%)
* **'21E Valuation:** 6.5x (Peer median 16.2x)
* **'22E Valuation:** 3.6x (Peer median 10.3x)
* These are very attractive valuations considering the growth compared to peers.
* **Trading Median (as of January 2021):** 1.6 transaction value/trading value (Trading median 3.1)
* **Revenue '21E:** $246MM (Peer median $120MM)
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Traded Mobility Tech Leaders:** $4.7Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Mobility SPAC Transactions:** $4.3Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Proterra:** $1.6Bn

**Let's do a little evaluating ourselves:**

**Shares outstanding post-merger:** 240.1MM

**Based on January ACTC prices pre NASDAQ sell-off:** $24/share

* 240.1MM \* $24/share = 5.76Bn Market Cap
* Let's find Proterra's value here without the SPAC shenanigans.
* 5.76Bn - $852MM = 4.91Bn Market Cap without SPAC cash
* 2022E estimated revenue is 439M
* 2022E adjusted .7561 for present value is 332M
* So unadjusted EV/Rev = 11.18
* And adjusted EV/Rev = 14.78
* Competitor EV/Rev = 10.3x on average for 2022E
* Proterra claims an 84% premium
* 1.84 \* 10.3 = 18.95
* So the industry metric is 18.95x.

**UNADJUSTED:**

* 439 unadjusted x 18.9 = 8.3B
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $9.162Bn unadjusted market cap
* 9.162/240.1 = **$38.16 unadjusted**
* 9.162Bn - 5.76Bn = **3.402Bn undervalued**

**ADJUSTED:**

* 332 \* 18.9 = 6.274Bn
* Add the cash from the SPAC: $852mm
* $7.126Bn adjusted market cap
* 7.126/240.1 = **$29.58 adjusted**
* 7.126 - 5.76 = **$1.366Bn undervalued**

**Average between adjusted and unadjusted:**

* Dollar value: $2.384Bn undervalued
* **Fair share price: $33.87**

[Here is another analyst finding it undervalued in a similar way on Feb 10th.](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/actc-stock-arclight-spac-merger-proterra-undervalued/)

*Let's think about that for a moment...*

As of this writing ACTC is trading at $15.65, based on purely fundamentals without speculation it is trading **116.42% below it's actual value.**

# Conclusion

Proterra is not only the most undervalued stock on the entire market, it's also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years. With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding post-merger which is expected to happen end of March-first week in April (although the official statement is ""the first half of this year""). 

The company is currently undervalued by 116.42% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the ""fair"" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.

**Bear Case:** I literally can't think of one aside from the merger falling apart. If someone could provide a bear case in the comments for Proterra (assuming the merger is successful) I would love to discuss it, because either I'm missing something glaringly obvious or this might be my greatest pick.

**How to Play?**

I am long on this with my shares. I will be holding all my shares for several years, my calls I will exercise half after the merger and sell the rest for a nice profit. If you want to just play the merger that's an option too. Meaning just hold until the merger date and sell at whatever you think the peak is that very day.

1. Buy shares, ACTC will change to PTRA after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
2. Warrants, ACTCW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
3. Calls, I think virtually anything listed is going to print (aside from 03/19)
4. Selling puts, the premiums are hefty so either you'll get a nice premium or you'll own some shares at a really nice discount.

**Positions:**

3,865 shares @ 22.37

10C 04/16 $20.00

12C 05/21 $22.50

17C 05/21 $25.00

6C 08/20 $35

**TL;DR:** Fundamental's alone show this company is already **116.42% undervalued**, factor in hype, forward-thinking, IPO, etc. and I can't even come up with a PT. I would *expect* a PT post-merger to travel upwards to \~$50-$60 and settle back down no lower than $34. EOY my prediction is \~$70-$80. 2025 prediction is \~$300-$500. I recommend you read. I wouldn't want to gloss this one over if I were you. If you prefer you could simply check out [their investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf) 

**EDIT:** The 10.3 factor is from an EV basket that includes many direct and indirect competitors. The list is in the presentation. 

**EDIT 2:** This is a fundamental DD. There are a lot of comments regarding other competitors not mentioned. Most of the companies not mentioned were including in the 10.3 factor for diversity. A lot of these competitors being mentioned are bus manufacturers, Proterra is a fleet level ecosystem infrastructure provider. They don’t just make buses. 

**EDIT 3:** Fair warning, even though Proterra is significantly undervalued, there are other market mechanics at play. With the NASDAQ sell off its uncertain how much lower ACTC will go if at all. I think this is an excellent play, now you just need excellent timing.

**EDIT4:** Added “2025E” to EDIBTA

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nothing I ever say or do is a financial recommendation. Any words urging someone to do something is only going as far as suggesting they do their own DD, it is in no way an attempt to convince anyone to make any financial decisions. Plus...this thing doesn't need to get pumped. I'm just trying to share the find.*",ACTC (Proterra) DD - The Most Undervalued Stock on the Entire Market

m0wbra,gqahjp0,investing,comment,1615261560,"What is their debt? What else is in the cap stack other than equity? 

Even so, your portion of the target is only about 15% of the equity. The SPAC at NAV is only about 340 mil ($10 \* 34.69 mil shares). So, the max that the SPAC can buy is $340 mil of value of the target. Based on your valuation, but without knowing the debt, the SPAC will own 340/2,400 = 15%. 

Unless you have better information than the agents brokering the deal, the SPAC share price is over valued. Unless new information comes out about the target that increases its valuation, then I wouldn't touch a SPAC more than 120% of its IPO price ($12 typically).

My disagreement doesn't stem from your DD, but rather more is based on how SPACs are effecting equity raises. However, I would look outside of the investor presentation for information regarding valuations and estimates. The SPACs job is to sell the SPAC because the sponsors have an incentive to raise money.",
m0wbra,gqb50gy,investing,comment,1615279636,"As a person who has done testing with them through Navistar, they still do not have much skin in the game. Sure, they teamed up with Daimler to electrify their products, and sure, they have their own bus line but there are a few factors here that most people dont know about the trucking industry and might pose a long term issue to Proterra:

1. People in the trucking industry are generally slower to change from whatever diesel, ng, and gasoline vehicles they have to electric, just because of emissions leniency in that marketplace compared to regular consumer vehicles. Because of that, the head start is not something that weighs heavy imo and the market will have plenty of opportunities to catch up. California is a big one, but the bigger projects, such as a few school bus projects,, were awarded to competitors over Proterra.  iirc. IC Bus comes to mind.
2. Bus's are also not exactly the biggest market to brag about if we are talking specifically about their ZX5/ZDi/S1LF electric bus's in comparison to the whole trucking market. Other competitors will have similar vehicles out  in the next year or so and while Proterra is already out and with sales, these OEMS will come out with vehicles that have similar eMPG's and will probably aim to be cheaper based on expected sales volume and will have the supplier support and brand recognition that Proterra does not have yet. Once these products come out, it might be an issue for Proterra (speculating here, prove me wrong tbh, would like to learn)

A perfect Example of what I mean in terms of Brand recognition and missed opportunities: IC Bus currently takes up  50% + of the market in school busses and have contracts with California already awarded for their eCharge Bus. This bus hasnt really even been released yet, but with majority of the market share, we still got the contract. I can imagine stuff like this will occur as time goes on and with market saturation in EV Bus's.

3. Who is to say that Daimler will not pull out of their partnership with Proterra? There are other battery powertrain competitors out there now that will be willing to provide drivetrains, cheaper than Proterra would in the future. Not to mention, this is Daimler we are talking about. They, just like VW have more than enough capabilities to take up their own EV architecture in the next few years (They already are) and scale up for the trucking industry.

4. For other types of trucks, vocational, heavy duty, long haul.... Hydrogen Power might be the better alternative long  term. The battery drivetrain is great until a load is given. The eMPG's do tend to drop significantly for applications where there might be a payload of atleast 15000 lbs or higher. The industry already recognizes that and is straying away from batteries for that  reason, except for Bus's if anything.

TLDR: Proterra imo, would be awesome if they had a head start and became the TSLA of trucks, but they dont and the trucking industry isnt the same as the consumer vehicle market, By the time they are out with any product outside of the Bus's that they have, they will be behind the industry leaders imo.

m15otm,gqbo8rd,investing,comment,1615295827,"the expected earnings growth rate should be forward looking; there are a few ways you can do this:

\- you can use the historical rates to find an average annual growth rate or even the CAGR (though this assumes the future growth rate will mimic the past)

\- you can forecast based on fundamentals i.e. create a model for the income statement where you can make assumptions for the revenue growth, expenses etc. and see what the future earnings growth will be based on your assumptions (subject to errors and biases)

\- a generic method of calculating earnings growth is ROE \* (1 - DPR). As an example a company that has an ROE of 20% and pays out a dividend of 0.10 on earnings of 1 would have a g of 20%\*(1-0.1) = 4.5%. Think of it as the growth rate of its earnings will be the earnings they retained (1-DPR) times the return on the retained amount (ROE). So you can forecast each of these metrics to find g

Air Canada AC.TO - Pre Covid was trading for about $50 a share, however, they also purchased AirTransat for about a 10th of what they should have. Post Covid, I fully expect this stock to go anywhere from $70-$100 CAD a share

Ovintiv OVV - Pre Covid was trading for $60 a share, They tanked to about $5 a share when Covid started and have been consistently on the rebound, bouncing back to almost $30 a share. I expect it to go back to normal levels within the next year.

Cenovus Energy [CVE.TO](https://cve.to/) \- Pre Covid was trading for anywhere from $30-$50 a share. As of right now it's trading at $10.57. With the purchase of Husky Energy. Again I expect this stock to likely go to $50 a share within the next year or two.

H2O Innovations Inc HEO.V - This is an upcoming company with solid financials that is sort of treading new ground. Their stock just took a dip and is starting to recover. With the need for clean water and company foundations, I'd expect this stock to hover around $5 a share when things get back to normal.

Cineplex Inc [CGX.TO](https://cgx.to/) \- Everyone seems to be going crazy for AMC right now, along with the Gamestop situation. But, the theater company with the better financials and less risk is Cineplex, not only are they in a better position when everything fully opens back up to have a huge bounce back but they pay a better dividend as well.

FSD Pharma [HUGE.CN](https://huge.cn/) \- Pot company that is building massive facilities and expanding as quite a high rate. As Pot becomes legal in more places, they will continue to grow.

Supreme Cannabis FIRE.V - Another pot company that is expanding quite a bit and with the same concept as [HUGE.CN](https://huge.cn/), will continue to grow as it becomes more legal.... Just keep in mind it's a volatile market.

Namaste Techology N.V - This is a medical company that holds several patents and expanding into several new markets around the world.

Empower Clinics [CBDT.CN](https://cbdt.cn/) \- This is an absolute whale of a stock. One of the smartest CEO's in the business, They just signed a massive deal with Rexall, They just took in $15.5 Million. To hit 10 times Market cap at $2.50 a share, all it has to do is sell $50 million this year.... It's looking like they might do double that. I fully expect this stock to be at $3 a share by the end of the year, I expect it to hit anywhere from $8-$15 a share with the next 3-5 years. Especially because of the patents they hold, the contracts that are being signed, they are expanding at a rapid rate without debt.",Potential big winners for investing

m1dqwi,,investing,post,1615317069,"**Synopsis:** I believe Upwork (NAS: UPWK) is going to be a strong long-term play through this year. Upwork possesses strong fundamentals, is relatively undervalued compared to its growth-stock peers, possesses a unique hold over its market, and is well-positioned within an exploding market place.

**Background: What is Upwork's Market?**

Upwork is a company within the professional *freelancing space*. For some background, freelancing is a modality of employment where people may participate in jobs of any duration, complexity, and tasks.

**Where is the value in Freelancing?**

*Employer's Perspective:*

* For small/medium businesses, it is *very difficult to find skilled employees* for unique task/jobs without spending a lot of money, resources, and time.  

   * It is often impractical, if not impossible, for small businesses to finance the hiring of an entire team of employees when there is limited work, limited capital, and high risk
   * Most jobs/tasks require less than a few hundred hours of work, so it would be ridiculous to attempt to hire employees for simple tasks. Yet, the tasks are often too sophisticated for the business owner, and they often lack time, so it is necessary to hire employees
* Many skilled independent consultants charge high premiums, especially within big-five countries, as it is too difficult to balance self-marketing and work in a manner which is more lucrative than a stable job
* Remote independent contractors require no work space, no benefits, and no additional complicated employee taxes
* It is often very risk to simply \*hire\* employees, as scams, fraud, and poor-quality work is rampant

*Employee's Perspective*

* As a skilled employee within a big-five country, stable jobs often limit upside-potential, underpay for potential, restrict flexibility, and are not feasible as ""side-gigs"" for extra cash
* For individuals with niche skills, it is often overwhelming to market oneself and attempt to find work. Often this requires a significant time investment which evolves from a side-gig to a side-job, which is too much to handle.
* As a skilled international employee outside the US/Europe, it is often very desirable to freelance for employers of different companies, as pay-rates are significantly higher.
* Since the COVID pandemic, remote work has become more normalized and very attractive
* American education is becoming very expensive, and many young, skilled workers in fields such as engineering, software development, data science, etc are finding it difficult to find work. Even if independent contracting isn't a primary job, it is a very lucrative and flexible way to subsidize income.
* It is often risk to perform work for employers, as many businesses are notorious for changing their mind about work after the employee has already invested time and resources, and there is a high rate of fraud.

**What Value Does Upwork Offer?**

* Upwork is an online freelancing platform for small-large businesses to find professional freelancers for their business.  

   * Employers post listings which detail descriptions of jobs.
   * Employees may ""bid"" on jobs by offering quotes which estimate the time and price of the job. Often, these quotes are only invisible to employers.  

      * Jobs may be paid in a fixed-fees or on an hourly basis
   * Employers may then select an employee by reviewing employee profiles (which feature ratings, employee verification/skill badges, and past work) as well as their quote, and initiate a chat/video conversation through the platform.
   * Once the employer and employee reach a deal, the employer deposits money within the Upwork escrow in the form of ""milestones""
   * Upwork provides an optional software tool that employees may download to track/log their work automatically
   * As the employee completes the work, milestones are then released or hourly wages are automatically invoiced through Upwork
   * Upwork allows employers/employees to track payment and progress
   * If a job goes side-ways and an employer/employee flakes, Upwork has systems to help refund the employer or pay the employee by having control over the Escrow
   * Once the job is complete, both parties leave ratings for each other.

In essence, they function as the middle-man between freelancers and businesses, providing a platform with a marketplace for freelancers and businesses to connect, a reliable Escrow service, strong anti-bot protection, employee identity verification, skill assessments, text/video chat features, workplace monitoring tools, and workplace payment tools.

Special Notes:

* Upwork has an identity-verification program to verify the identities of employees by live video chats and brief interviews
* Upwork has strong anti-bot protection which is very strict on following rules
* Upwork bans any users which its machine learning algorithms detect are trying to migrate work off the platform  

   * Although one might see this as the fatal flaw of Upwork, job migration is very uncommon, as it is extremely hard to create a new account without falsifying bank statements, passport information, etc. accounts

**How Does Upwork Stand Against Its Competitors?**

*Preface:* One important piece of information to understand, speaking as a veteran within Freelancing, is that within Freelancing, it is not like technology where people experiment with the next shiniest product: freelancing has a lot of competition, so employees drift to the marketplace with the most jobs, and employers naturally drift to the market place with the most employees. This is important, as my faith in Upwork is more so rooted in its current thriving and competent marketplace rather than some unique technological innovations. This is a very strong positive, as new freelancers and businesses are naturally going to google ""Freelancing"" or ""Find work"" and join the place with all the jobs -- not the company with the slightly shinier work place buttons.

Upwork two main competitors: *Fiverr* and *Freelancer*

* *Fiverr:*  

   * This name gets thrown around a lot as a competitor to Upwork. In my opinion, this makes absolutely no sense. Fiverr is a great litmus test for freelancing and does a great job in cute side-gigs, but it is a place where freelancers market services to people -- not people requesting jobs for freelancers.  

      * This makes it a unique platform, but it is substantially different than Upwork
      * In my experience, Fiverr is riddled with teenagers offering miscellaneous small-tasks, and with the occasional professional offering premium services.
      * This is not a place for businesses to find employees or for employees to find work.
      * Having been an employer of over 100 freelancers across numerous jobs, I have yet to encounter a single one that felt Fiverr was more attractive for their work.
      * The proof is in the pudding: there are almost no people that make a living off Fiverr, but there is a rapidly growing number of people making a living off Upwork.
   * Fiverr, nevertheless, has been very successful, and it has still attracted the attention of many small businesses.
   * This, to me, is a very strong indicator that there is massive potential within the market.
* *Freelancer*  

   * Freelancer is indeed a much more comparable company to Upwork, offering an online marketplace for employers to post jobs with similar features of Upwork
   * Having a lot of experience within this space, however, Freelancer, has continuously turned out to be a disappointment. Freelancer is saturated with bots, largely dominated by international fraudulent/low-value job listings, and features a markedly worse workforce.
   * Having worked with many Freelancers, the most common request I get is to migrate my job to Upwork, as they experience much better employers, pay, and treatment there.
   * Freelancer has very poor anti-bot protection and almost never bans Freelancers. If banned, making new accounts are trivial.
   * Overall, Freelancer may have the same functionalities at face, but Upwork is to Freelancer as Amazon is to Ebay -- one is premier (albeit with some flaws) while one is often junk.

**Upwork Growth Potential:**

Upwork's revenue has been steadily increasing year-over-year, from $223,000,000 in 2018 to $268,000,000 in 2019 to $338,000,000 in 2020. While one could argue its revenue was helped by COVID, I posit that the popularization of at-home work through Youtube, COVID, and social media has made it very attractive in the long-run. After all, freelancing is very much a critical-mass issue, where now that Upwork has sustainably attracted numerous new employers, there is sufficient work to attract more employees and more employers.

Upwork is mostly an online business, so its books are good with a Current Ratio of 1.82 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08.

While Upwork's EBIDTA is holding steady at around $14,000,000, we see its ""Sales and Marketing"" have shot up from $72,000,000 in 2018 to $133,000,000 in 2020, and ""Administration"" and ""R&D"" have likewise increased year-over-year to absorb the increasing revenue.

Knowing the number of customers is rapidly increasing on Upwork (from 105,000 core customers in 2019 to 145,000 core customers in 2020), this is very positive in my opinion, as this is not an indicator of Upwork struggling with a high CAC, but it is instead telling that they are aggressively pushing for market-share, as employees/employers are king in Freelancing.

Moreover, Upwork's escrows report $135,000,000 for 2020 and $108,000,000 in 2019, indicating money is steadily growing into their markets.

With jobs poised to rapidly increase as the economy reopens, I would expect much more activity within Upwork. I have personally observed substantially more rich listings appear since last February. They even note this decline of jobs due to COVID within their 10-K, ironically suggestion that despite COVID popularizing remote work, the best is yet to come.

Interestingly enough, Fiverr has nearly the same types of financials (low EBITDA, high push for marketing, steadily rising customers), but it is trading at a (40.71 EV/revenue, 37.2 price to sales, and 411 price/cash flow) and as opposed to Upwork's (11.84 EV/revenue, 14.06 price to sales, and 234 price to cash flow). As a result, Upwork is currently trading around $44 while Fiverr is trading around $218.

While their are definitely differences between the companies, I suspect a big component of this is the popularity of Fiverr, as it was popularized a few years prior to Upwork. However, seeing Upwork's steady growth, seeing how its financials compare to Fiverr, and seeing how its EBITDA will skyrocket the moment they ease up on R&D/Sales& Marketing (much like Amazon's strategy), I believe it can definitely reach $100+ within 1-2 years.

**Pros:**

* Dominating marketplace with high switching costs
* Low EBITDA/profit financials are due to investment into software and securing marketplace (much like Amazon)
* Financially comparable to FIVERR which trades at around 5x UPWK's value
* Provides very valuable and justifiable services to employees and employers
* Poised to benefit from economic recovery
* Steady growth and customer acquisition
* Considering ""premier"" among many Freelancers
* Companies have changed many positions permanently to remote, and COVID has normalized remote work
* Transition towards tech in industry is ideal for remote work

**Risks:**

I would be remiss not to mention any risks in mind, as there are always of course risks.

* Upwork is largely supported by its aggressive marketing and advertising to secure its current market share. Similar to Ebay, it is very hard to convince people to sell on your empty platform while another has all the customers. That said, if another company swoops in and undercuts Upwork with a massive massive marketing campaign, it could disrupt Upwork.
* Upwork has no technological features that are truly propietary
* Rising jobs and COVID coup may attract people back out into real-word jobs instead of leaving lasting changes to
* Upwork may continue to invest in sales/marketing for a long time, keeping EBITDA low for a while, which may hold back the stock price",UPWK - Undervalued Online Freelancing Company With Strong Growth Potential

m1dqwi,gqdnjqj,investing,comment,1615327212,"I've used Upwork for a few years when I really needed freelance work. Referring to freelancers as ""employees"" is sugar coating it. It is a garbage platform that takes way, way too much money from your pay (comes out of the freelancers end, not the clients). A vast majority of freelancers I know stay far away from Upwork and sites like it, or only use them out of desperation. They jump ship from Upwork as soon as they're able to. 

The jobs are mostly trash, are usually a race-to-the-bottom and demand too much for too little pay. Clients are usually unprofessional, often don't know what they're doing, or get confused by Upwork's payment system. Most job listings are looking to outsource tasks to countries with a low cost of living. I have no doubts they'll continue to grow, but I hope the whole platform implodes on itself.",

In general, hiring freelancers online is frustrating. People who are good at what they do develop their own client base and get regular work that comes to them, so they don’t need to use these websites. People who suck spend all their time on these platforms bidding for jobs that they aren’t qualified for.

There are some people who are good who are still building their client base. That’s what you really want to find on these platforms, but it’s not common.

I would say I’ve hired 3 people that do solid work on these platforms and 20 people that lied about their skills, did shitty work, or disappeared. I feel like I’m underpaying the good people and vastly overpaying the bad people.

I’m very hopeful that some kind of blockchain solution will come along to create a record of a person’s portfolio and provide a decentralized market for freelance workers.",

m0zj8w,,investing,post,1615267052,"# KMB - Kimberly Clark / Dividend 3.47%

* The company's personal care segment could see a nice uptick as overall awareness for hygiene and cleanliness is increased, as well as more stringent requirements by services like cruise ships and airlines being implemented as the world opens back up.
* Their consumer tissue division also saw an increase in volume as the work-from-home trend was set into motion by covid, with a portion of these individuals working from home indefinitely.
* Their dividend growth has been steady for nearly 50 years with this year marking 49 straight years of dividend growth.
* A restructuring plan started back in 2018 should be wrapping up in 2021. This plan was meant to cut out unnecessary costs and to put the company on track for continued future growth. 2020 revenue grew by 3.7% to 19.1 billion with net income rising 9% YOY to 2.4 billion.

# O - Realty Income REIT / Dividend 4.65%

* Dividend is paid out monthly, designed to provide investors with reliable monthly income.
* Revenues and FFO per share are up YOY
* Very strong financials and management - they currently have a $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial term that expires in 2023. There were no borrowings on its credit facility as of Dec 2020.
* Well diversified portfolio of properties and adapted to change quickly in the 2020 pandemic environment - they are expecting an acquisition volume of $3.25 billion in 2021 notably due to the company's solid financial position and investment pipeline.

# MMM - 3M / Dividend 3.21%

* People focused on their respirator masks and respirators as their bread and butter over the past year. This was a godsend for them, as they are now able to use their 2020 revenues from their safety/industrial segment as well as their healthcare segment to continue growth in their other segments.
* Their other segments include their transportation and electronics, as well as their consumer segment. Both are cyclically aligned segments and are yet to fully recover offering a very nice opportunity for growth.
* The stock trades on 15x its current FCF (free cash flow per share) - theoretically, they could pay over a 6% dividend with their current revenues and still be able to grow the business.
* A total of 56 hedge funds were holding the stock heading into Q4 of 2020, topping the all-time-highs of 52.
* They are ""restructuring management for growth"".

# MAIN - Main Street Capital / Dividend 6.7%

* Their dividend is paid out monthly.
* Although their net earnings were effected by the pandemic, they demonstrated they were able to withstand market volatility via their diversified investments and high liquidity.
* Over 80% dividend growth since IPO with a large span of investments across a number of different sectors.
* If you are looking for a way to gain exposure to the financial sector but hate to mess with big banks and other sketchy financial plays, this may be a good stock for you.

# KR - Kroger / Dividend 2.09%

* Digital sales jumping over 100% YOY - their online grocery segment is newly developed and will be in the works for years to come. Without going on a rant about why, I believe Amazon will begin to lose steam to smaller companies as they take back market share via investing in similar methods and technologies in order to deliver their own services and products in a similar way.
* They are currently invested in a number of improvements from their in-store and online technology to space optimization and store remodeling.
* I am not going to do a huge write up on this ticker, I just like the stock.

>Set up a DRIP by contacting investor relations for a particular company or contact your brokerage for whatever offers they may have regarding dividend reinvestment into certain securities. This is a great way to put your dividend payments to use early on as they can seem insignificant for those just starting out. Do not expect to live off of your dividend payments. Yet. Let them grow and roll profits from growth plays back into the positions you are holding. Do not worry about stock price as you will be receiving dividends on every dime of your investment, not to mention dollar cost averaging should keep your cost basis nice.",Value with a focus on long-term dividend reinvestment / DD Stock Write-up

I use GLAD instead of MAIN as my small cap financial services company. Pretty much the same structure: diversity using both debt and equity financing for small private companies, finances across industries, monthly dividend with history of dividend growth. GLAD cut their dividend a little at the initial stages of the pandemic, but I think it will start to grow back this year. 

Only on I would be a little worried about is KR. Grocers and big box stores have seen a massive growth in revenues this past year, but as everything starts to move back to normal, I think this may start to stagnate. I haven't done DD, just think that the industry it set to slow down some.",

m1607f,,investing,post,1615295256,"This DD will be put into 3 parts. First is a presentation of the company and it’s products, second is a market/finance presentation and third are speculations.

Disclaimer: Relay Medical will be referred to as RM, FioNet as FN.

I. Company and Products

Relay Medica (founded in 2014)l is a MedTech innovation Company headquartered in Toronto, Canada focused on the development of novel technologies in the diagnostics and AI data science sectors.

The most promising product is called “FioNet”. FN is a proven data-and-device platform for pandemic response that enables controlled, community-based testing, triage, and real-time tracking to manage current and future biothreats. Originally, it was and still is in use in Africa for the medical management of Ebola, E Coli and Malaria where it showed price efficient effectiveness. 
As late 2020, RM began to program FN for the rapid diagnostic testing of SARS CoV-2 (Covid). This allows for a management of mass testing and tracking, delivering live data in a short amount of time.
The Tests that FN receives are automatically sent, processed and evaluated by Servers in Toronto, making FN ultimately a live service, allowing for high accuracy, efficiency and (when needed) real time problem solving. The safety of this online Data-Transfer is granted through the recently by RM bought IoT Cybersecurity Company “Cybeats Technologies”.
The current locations that FN is being made for are Hospitals and Airports. More to this in Part III. 

Current Contracts for FN:

-Meru County ministry of health (Including multiple hospitals)

-Toronto Airport (For staff and travelers) 

Other products:

-Hemopalm (Handheld blood analysis device with same accuracy as hematological  Analysis Laboratory)

-Glow Lifetech (plant based, natural health boosting drops that assist absorption of nutrions and fat (micellization))

-Pharmatrac (AI based medication analysis of medication behaviour)




II. Market/Finance

Current Share price: 0,420 Euro ; 0,501 Dollars

Daily Volume: Germany - 31.000 ; Canada - 3,011,889

Marketcapitalisation: 87,84 Million Euro ; 104 Million Dollars

Available Shares: 197 Million

1 Year Return: 225.00%

Price per Share Rise since Beginning 2021: 360% Peak, currently 250%

Shares Outstanding: 179.36 Million

Following Data is from December 2020! 

Liquidity:

Current Ratio - 0.98

Quick Ratio - 0.98

Cash Ratio - 0.59

Capital Structure:

Total Debt to total Equity - 153.12

Total Debt to total Capital - 60.49

Total Debt to total Assets - 46.80

Long Term Debt to Equity - 43.95

Long Term Debt to total Capital - 17.36

Conclusion: 

While the outstanding shares and Data from December might be offputting, it has to be remembered that RM’s FN Development has only really been public since mid January. It also has to be kept in mind that the operations in Africa, specifically Kenya during Malaria, E Coli and Ebola, had only been funded by NGO’s and partially kenyan Health Officials. Important to understand is, that FN thus has only been used in third world countries, meaning a privitasation of FN so far was impossible ~ Thus few profits.

 Another important aspect is the most bearish argument: Current Earnings, which are in the negatives. RM is a medical company. This includes loads of research, agreements and green lighting by healthcare officials. FN is currently not even actively implemented, the previously named contracts have been set up about a month ago. So what you are looking at are premature numbers. 





III. Speculations

Biggest Issues: 

- Practically nonexistent PR

- No FN Contracts on international base (For example Europe)

- Penny Marketprice (could be fixed by 2:1 reversed Split)

Important for RM as of right now is to ace the use of FN in Toronto Airport. This could be the first dedicated use of FN in a first world country that is not used in hospitals.

If this happens, which is very likely, then it is very much possible that FN gets international momentum. Especially countries or Organizations that stand in good relations with Canada could very much find interest in its use (France, US, NATO, possibly India)

Also, I see FN on a bigger spectrum than Hospitals and Airports. If the right connections are made, FN could find use in Concerts, Museums, Offices and Conventions, for Staff or Visitors.

My EOY speculative Price stands at either (realistic) 3 Euro ; 3,50 Dollars or (bullish) 10 Euro ; 11,90 Dollars

- Corsair (CRSR) : had stellar earnings and they make fantastic products in the gaming and PC hardware space.  They're making good acquisitions in the streaming space.  

- Salesforce (CRM) : another solid company that has taken a big beating for no apparent reason.  They recently acquired Slack and I dont see any other competitor being remotely close in the CRM space. 

- Square (SQ): revolutionizing payments for small businesses.  

- Cloudflare (NET): yet to turn profitable but a great tech company that is growing rapidly. 

- Snowflake (SNOW): another tech company that was overvalued upon IPO and climbed all the way to $429 before being brought back to earth.  Currently trading at  $213

- Costco (COST): solid company that has a loyal following and great business model.  

- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM): market leader in chip manufacturing and with the current shortage in chips,  their future looks great. 

- Teladoc (TDOC): one of the big companies in the telemedicine space that should thrive in the post covid world as more patients want the convenience of seeing their doctor from the comfort of their own home. 

- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY): pharma giant that made key acquisitions recently (Celgene and Myokardia) that should boost their pipeline and revenue.  Also pays good dividend. 

- Facebook (FB) : social media giant that isn't going away anytime soon.  Would be interesting to see how they leverage Oculus to boost their revenue.  

- CVS (CVS) : pharmacy giant that should get a boost from covid vaccine rollout and their new in-house clinics. 

- Tattooed Chef (TTCF): fast growing company in the plant based protein and healthy frozen foods space.  They have products in almost all major retailers and are rapidly expanding.  

- Nvidia (NVDA): leader in GPU space and a tech giant.  

- Palantir (PLTR): big data company with a revolutionary product that is just getting started.  

- Qualcomm (QCOM): makes chips for phones and are well established for the 5G Era

- American Tower Corp (AMT): they make/ rent out cell signal towers and should benefit from the move to 5G

- Planet13 Holdings (PLNHF): they make giant superstores for Marijuana sale and are set to have their own brand of products

Currently sitting at around £2.40 and we may even get a small dip on Friday/Monday when IPO shares get released. This is an incredible bargain for what is in my view the best run crypto mining company on any markets. 

This latest IPO offering, while being a small dilution, is actually paying for an increased stake in Pluto Digital Assets. 

Argo have recently also just purchased a massive amount of land in Texas where they are going to expand their business using cheap renewable electricity.

https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/942821/argo-blockchain-cranks-up-production-in-february-942821.html

Argo have increased production of bitcoin from January to February and with Btc prices rising too, their revenue will increase exponentially from month to month. 

One thing I like about Argo is how efficiently run they are, they're making margins if 81% on mining Bitcoin which tells me they can weather any potential dips in price very easily.

I was on the fence with bitcoin for the longest time, but I think its here to stay for the foreseeable future. More and more retailers are accepting it, big businesses like Tesla are investing in it and it is being talked about more and more. Price predictions vary but $100,000 per coin by the end of this year seems likely. This would in effect over double Argo's profit margins. 

Argo's CEO is incredibly open and honest. He regularly posts video messages for investors explaining their business moves. Its refreshing to see and it really shows you the inner workings of the company.

Of course its a bet on Bitcoin climbing, although Argo is currently undervalued compared to riot and mara. It has a market cap approximately a third of its competitors with similar raw processing power and much better future prospects in my opinion.

A nasdaq listing is imminent and you can expect share price to triple in that event immediately and that's not taking into account the increasing bitcoin prices and the  ever increasing production rates from Argo. 

People are scared because Argo has had huge gains already but this really is the start. I think 10x current share price by the end of 2021 is more than likely.","With BTC on an upwards trajectory, there is still a value play in miners.

**Stock: UWM Holdings ($UWMC)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +1286.9%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +2762%

Average sentiment across mentions: **+21.83%**

**Core Product**

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC’s mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)

**Financials**

UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.

UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.

Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.

Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)

Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to some meme stocks in short interest (140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)

NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).

**Risk and Competition**

75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC’s refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.

There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don’t completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).

The full impact of UWMC’s CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn’t work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.

**Conclusion**

This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play.

m1ph0m,,investing,post,1615351041,"The Most Undervalued SPAC of 2021, SVAC.

Starboard Acquisition ($SVAC - $10.06) – Cyxtera

OVERVIEW :

Cyxtera, the 3rd largest data center group in the world, has agreed to go public via Starboard Acquisition Corp ($SVAC). This may be one of the most unglamorous and un-exciting SPAC mergers to date, but my belief is that this is one of the cleanest, if not the cleanest, companies to go public through a SPAC, and will ultimately be a major player in the market within the data center category.
First, let’s start with Cyxtera’s business model. What you’re looking at here is two-fold. Cyxtera is both a REIT as a large owner of 61 data centers across 29 markets on 4 continents, but also an integrated tech company – providing colocation (equipment, space, and bandwith rentals) to their customers. In short, they house data – literally and technologically. The business model is relatively simple. Customers sign contracts (guaranteed income) for data housing in one or multiple of Cyxtera’s facilities, and in return gain flexibility and access to agility for their data needs. Every large company in the world uses the types of facilities and technology that Cyxtera provides – from State Farm to the New York Yankees to Nvidia.

FINANCIALS & STRATEGY:

Diving into some deeper data about Cyxtera, we can learn about the financial health of Cyxtera, and how they utilize their revenues that they collect through their contracts. First, and extremely importantly, Cyxtera is already both profitable and operating at scale. 2020 revenues of $690M and adjusted EBITDA of $213M is a showstopper for a company that is coming to market through a SPAC, many of which are pre-revenue and have a long ramp time to profitability. The deal with Starboard Acquisition values Cyxtera at $3.4 Billion – with only room for growth – as the need for the services that Cyxtera offers only growing substantially year over year.
Staggeringly, only 3% of Cyxtera’s revenue go towards customer retention. For anybody not in marketing, that is an absolutely astounding number. Only needing 3% of your revenue to retain customers at scale would have any financial executive or investor frothing at the mouth and falling over themselves to be a part of it. In turn, 70% of Cyxtera’s revenue goes towards growth, expansion, and development. That is in a class of it’s own, truly. Those dollars go towards building an extensive partner ecosystem, built efficiently through a go-to-market strategy that creates a symbiotic relationship between Cyxtera and their partners. Partners of Cyxtera enjoy integration capabilities, meaning they can sell Cyxtera’s services as a part of their own, expanding the suite of t ools they can offer to prospective clients. The closer you can get to a one stop shop in the technology space, the more likely you are to attract business – this is the overall goal.

Did I mention that the management of $SVAC (not Cyxtera) has already succ essfully run and sold a similar companyinthepast?TheexecutivechairmanpreviouslyranTerremarkWorldwide,whichsold to Verizon, and coincidentally, ultimately ended up in the hands of the largest player in the data center space, Equinix.

MARKET COMPARISONS:

Logically, it’s important to evaluate the space that any new public company is entering. In Cyxtera’s case, they are the 3rd largest player. The largest players are $EQIX and $DLR. For the purposes of this writeup, we will only look at comparisons from a market perspective.

$EQIX
Most recent closing price: $622.71 Shares outstanding: 89M
Market Cap: $55 Billion Institutional Ownership %: 95%
Eqix is a massive data center player, arguably the best there is. Here, it’s important to compare outstanding shares to the number Cyxtera will have. In this case, Cyxtera will have an approximately equal number of shares – and has rapidly growing institutional ownership, with 82% positive change in recent weeks on $SVAC and a total % of 59% currently.

$DLR
Most recent closing price: $135.08 Shares outstanding: 280M
Market Cap: $37 Billion Institutional Ownership %: 96%
DLR is the 2nd largest data center player. They have over 3x the outstanding shares of Cyxtera & $EQIX. You’ll notice that DLR is trading at 13x the price that $SVAC sits today. These are not perfect comps, but this is what the world values these types of companies at. These aren’t even outlandish valuations – and data centers often carry very respectable dividends. In this case, 3.44%.
Players in this space typically trade at 6-9x their sales, approximately 7-23x free cash flow, and over 20x EBITDA. As it stands, considering the nature of SPACs, $SVAC is not anywhere near these numbers. But, Cyxtera will get there – the industry itself has proven it over and over. The growth in share price over time is inevitable.

MERGER:

The final piece to touch on for now will be how this business combination will take place. This is a VERY special SPAC deal and has incentives that have gone unnoticed by the market. Shares of $SVAC include a 1/6 warrant. The units include 1/6 warrant in ADDITION to a share to compensate for the risk of holding through the business combination. This makes $SVAC set up in a better space than almost any other SPAC trading near NAV price. In addition, if the ticker does poorly as it moves towards the business combination, you’ll receive additional warrants to compensate for the risk. These units are excessively attractive.
The deal itself, my goodness. Insider shares are locked for a year OR until the stock hits $12. This means if you get in below this number, you are very unlikely to suffer through dilution/redemption that will create downwards pressure.

CONCLUSION:

Ultimately – the decision is yours to make. Personally – I like the stock. This is an opportunity to purchase a stake in a company that is significantly undervalued and unnoticed at it’s current price, and with some of the cleanest financials on the market, it’s hard to ignore the safety that this ticker brings – especially welcome safety in a tumultuous time in world history. Adjusted to include the warrants that are included in the units, you’re looking at the lowest priced SPAC that has announced a deal, period. The lowest price, with one of the highest and most stable potentials of any SPAC out there. Data centers are cash cows, and this one hasn’t even begun to moo in the market. I see potential for a huge amount of growth in a rapid period, with very competent management and a solid market strategy leading the way. At $10, there’s not a better deal on the market. Analysts have called the potential ‘explosive’. I call it kingmaking.

Oh – if you aren’t convinced yet - Cyxtera also announced expansion today. And the market missed it, because no ticker was mentioned. Check it out here:

VBR follows the CRSP Small Cap Value - CRSP has a lot of overlap in capitalization spaces bc of how they calculate their index - a lot of mid cap in their small cap funds, a lot of large cap in their mid cap funds, a lot of mid cap in their large cap funds.  SLYV is a pure S&P 600 value fund.  IWN will track the Russell 2000 Small Cap value, which is better than CRSP with overlap but is less tax efficient.

As you would imgaine they all have varying returns as a result.

YTD:
IJR - 19.79% (S&P 600 Core)
VBR - 15.93% (more mid cap based on CRSP)
SLYV - 26.37% (Pure S&P 600 value)
IWN  - 21.72% (Russell 2000 Value)

Finally, I have said it before and have been downvoted and I dont care and will say it again.  ARK funds are speculative dogshit funds and Cathy is replicating the .com star stock picker model.  It has a PE ratio of 52.97 bc of TSLA, but the majority of its holdings have negative PE (read PE of 0).  She will kill in periods of irrational exuberence but the funds will lag when fundamentals become important, which is most of the time.  TSLA alone has dropped 1/3 of its value, another sword I constantly fall on when I tell people it is overvalued and get downvoted to hell.
 
You may not remember the dot com bubble but I do.  Its a spitting image.

Anyway, what funds you pick matter.",

1) show that they can produce vaccines for new variants extremely quickly. Running trials and getting FDA approval is harder though, and we saw the market waiting for that approval on their first vaccine. 
2) advance their ability to fundamentally change cancer treatment. This is maybe 3-5 years away.

m0l36g,gq8yt3u,investing,comment,1615233871,"The “competitive advantage” you mentioned seems to have shifted to JNJ, not only because of the existence of its one-dose regimen, but because that efficacy is a “floor” of what we can expect from JNJ’s two-dose regimen, for which phase 3 trials are underway. 

Think of it this way: JNJ proved that its one-dose vaccine is “good enough” by a pretty decent margin. If the two-dose regimen is even more successful and approaches or exceeds Pfitzer/Moderna’s efficacy under the same variant conditions, everyone would switch to JNJ and ditch the others (it’s cheaper, easier to store and transport). So at a minimum, JNJ has a successful competitor that will draw significant market share away. Best-case scenario (for JNJ), in the coming months, it can provide an even more effective two-dose regimen which has been proven to still be highly effective if the second dose isn’t taken (which is possible/even probable in many communities).",
m0l36g,gq91wzq,investing,comment,1615235219,"First and foremost, Moderna is a young company with a very small portfolio of products.

They will be more volatile, because they don't have as many product offerings to rely on, much less ones with competitive advantages.

Whereas Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson are traditionally value companies with a wide, mature portfolio of product offerings. They rely less on the Covid-19 vaccine, but enjoy the extra profits from it when it is there.

The second problem with Moderna and Astrezenca are going to have is 2nd and 3rd world countries. These are places with less money to spend per dose, but have a very amount of need. However, they do not have near as good infrastructure or resources for the deep freezing required of the mRNA vaccines.

So moving forward the traditional vaccine style of one shot and a lower level of refrigeration needed is going to become extremely important for getting bulk contracts for 1/2 of the world's population.

Another headwind is that last surge went away steep and quick, signaling there could be an end in sight.

Moderna was the largest benefactor of Operation Warp Speed and that gave them a leg up on the competition initially, but now that first mover advantage is dying away and they don't have much of a portfolio of products to lean back on. 

This all while still not having a positive quarter yet! Don't forget that. They still need to turn a profit and their competitive advantage is starting to diminish.

They could become a successful company. They have the right brain power, patents, name recognition, etc...  However, they need to apply this to new products and they will have to overcome the FDA certification barriers with more scrutiny for non-Covid products.",
m0l36g,gq9zg6y,investing,comment,1615251566,"I am waiting to see how far it drops before jumping on Moderna and I literally don't care if it sells another C19 vaccine in its life (and yet it already submitted for FDA approval their E484K variant booster so yes they will).  

2 Years ago a 5B company sits now 21B in 2021 sales locked in and a fresh manufacturing footprint paid for by BARDA with 1B in US taxpayer money... and they are out to cure cancer and end diseases with their knowledge and expertise of turning your cells into 3D printers.

Regardless of how many competitors release new C19 vaccines, Moderna's sales are not impacted.  Moderna charges the most and gives the least fuck regarding future pricing.  They can do this because their technology is newer and better.  Did you know that some of the conventional vaccines can't be 'updated' once someone has had that vaccine?  If C19 immunity requires extra boosters than why not go with the new mRNA goodness?

Sequoia-Backed Driverless Truck Startup Seeks SPAC MergerBy 

Lulu Yilun Chen

March 8, 2021, 1:22 AM ESTUpdated on March 8, 2021, 2:11 AM EST

Self-driving truck startup Plus is in advanced talks with a few special purpose acquisition companies for a merger, as it seeks to bankroll its expansion in the autonomous driving industry, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Sequoia Capital-backed company has received several letters of intent from the U.S.-listed SPACs and is weeks away from a deal announcement, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. The SPACs range in size from $300 million to $500 million, and Plus is planning to set its valuation range later this month, one of the people said.

Plus is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and will start a roadshow for additional financing via a private investments in public equity, or PIPE, transaction after it chooses a SPAC, the people added. Representatives for Plus and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

The Cupertino, California-based firm is among a handful of startups that are trying to up-end a fragmented long-haul trucking business with driverless technology. It has been working with Chinese delivery company SF Holding Co., which uses Plus-enabled autonomous trucks covering 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) on a daily basis, according to Plus. State-owned China FAW Group Co. plans to start mass production of jointly developed autonomous trucks in the second quarter, Plus has said.

Full Truck Alliance will use its network, which links drivers and cargo, as a sales channel for Plus trucks.

Founded by a group of Stanford University classmates in 2016, Plus is backed by investors including Chinese long-haul company Full Truck Alliance, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. and GSR Ventures Management. The startup raised $200 million in a funding round in February that attracted new investors such as Guotai Junan International Holdings and Citic Private Equity Funds Management Co.

The company recently hired Dennis Mooney from truckmaker Navistar International Corp. to scale up production, and Chuck Joseph from Amazon.com Inc. to help truck fleets adopt Plus technology.

m037w1,,investing,post,1615162141,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations**
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies 
   * To be clear, I’m not saying ARK’s picks are all bulletproof. Just using the fund’s picks since they have a much bigger research team and resources than an individual investor such as myself, so **think of this post as a potential** ***starting point*** **for more research**

**My Process & Selection Criteria**

* First of all, I’ll be excluding all non-tech stocks in my analysis because I personally like to focus on tech. Including healthcare stocks (which pretty much are what the non-tech stocks are) ruins the metric comparisons given the differences in industries.
* My process was pretty simple. Downloaded all the tickers from ARK, pulled data from wallmine or went through filings myself. As a result, there may be some slight discrepancies from the data you use and mine but they should be around the same ballpark.
* Next, my **selection criteria,** which will I’ll likely change over time each week. Today the ones I’m using include the following (data sourced from wallmine and filings):
   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",ARKK (Innovation Fund) Top 5 Stock Picks - Week Ending 3/7/21

That's a gain of 12.5%.  Worldwide pandemic with people holed up in their houses, doordash only ups by 12.5%.  Not bullish.  

**Lockup expiration:**  
Doordash float is 144M.  
[Doordash stock lockup expires 3/9, making 110M shares available.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-discloses-early-expiration-of-lockup-agreements-on-about-114-million-shares-2021-03-01)  

The stock has basically ""peaked"".  Won't there be a massive selloff in the coming weeks?  **It seems rational to me,** that DDash insiders know the stock has peaked, and will want to get rid of shares while the going is good.  

However, the short interest is only 5.4%.  I would expect a much higher short if it were really going to tank.  For comparison, GRUB shortint is a whopping 20%.  Thoughts?",Doordash should drop in coming weeks.

The main reason they can't achieve profitability is because they throw constant promos and discount offers to users to use their platform, which inflate revenue and users, but not profits. In fact, customer acquisition and retention cost more than the net profit margin they get per user. It's a losing strategy long term.",

And this just never made any sense to me.  With a body shop, as you scale, you need more and more mechanics.  And, I always felt GrubHub would always need more and more drivers as it scales.  I could never get past this.

I've spent a while trying to figure out the blockchain space for companies that are long-term investable. Miners don't seem to have a sustainable business model for long term investing due to the block rewards dropping and competition increasing as BTC price increases. I think I have finally found one that  can be invested in for the long term; $TAAL. Taal is positioning itself as a transaction processor, which includes mining, but is also so much more. Taal's president has recently touted the company as aiming to be the Amazon Web Services of blockchain. Sounds lucrative! The company is still small and in the very early stages of operations, which means I think the risk/reward is very favourable.

Skip to the section titled ""Taal’s Business Operations and Prospects"" on page 6 if you want the meat and potatoes of the report.

Discussion should attempt to link back investing wherever possible despite the company operating in the blockchain sector.

[$40M share offering announced Wednesday evening](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/taal-announces-marketed-public-offering-of-up-to-40-million-866380411.html)

This should put a floor on the share price around the offering price of $4.60. Could be a nice entry point for anyone looking to start a position. [Further details](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/taal-provides-update-on-public-offering-842494254.html)

m119u4,,investing,post,1615274221,"A super promising investment is in a company called Clinuvel- they specialise in a drug (afamelanotide) that gives people a natural tan. It’s been around for a while and has an excellent safety record (it was approved in Europe in 2014, the US in October 2019, Australia in 2020 and Israel in 2021).

It’s efficacy is outstanding - as 96.6% of patients who started receiving treatment in 2016 were still using the drug in 2020 (stats released in a June 2020 report).

It’s approved to treat EEP (a rare skin condition), but they have current trials evaluating its effectiveness for vitiligo and other skin diseases. They also have topical creams in the pipeline which you can buy OTC.

Importantly, the drug will inevitably be used off-label for cosmetic applications. And when this happens, the price will go to the moon. Anyone who wants to look good/ feel good about themselves and reduce the chances of skin cancer, will want to get their hands on this. Unlike fake tan, this offers a natural looking tan, while protecting against skin cancer - saving lives. Forget baking yourself in the sun or looking like an oompa loompa - afamelanotide will change the game.

Just like Vigara (which was approved to treat heart conditions) and Botox (which was approved to treat eye muscle disorders) - it's only a matter of time before afamelanotide can be used off-label.

Their financial situation is very solid - they made 16.6m profit in the 2020 financial year, while having zero debt and $72m in cash (as of 28 Jan 2021).

It’s listed on the ASX under CUV and on the OTCPK as CLVLY.",Huge Opportunity - Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals

I’m not holding for potential off label use, though. It’s all the other stuff: DNA repair, cosmetics soon to be released, stroke (AIS) and the mere financial potential of the indication which is already approved by the FDA, EMA, TGA (AUS) and Israel and soon China: EPP. The company is extremely undervalued even just based on that indication. And EPP is only a proof of concept in the long run. Within the next two years they will roll out several other bigger indications and that’s where the fat is. No debt, already approved and big likelihood of follow on indications and cosmetic use soon. Another 1000 % easy IMO. DYOR",

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
> “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
> “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
> # Growth vs. cyclicals
> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
> “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
> “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
> “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
> “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
> “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
> Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
> “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
> # Bond volatility
> There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
> The program expires March 31.
*****
> “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
> “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
> “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

> March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

> # Signs of Life in Europe?

> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

> While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

> We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

> # Versatile Outperformers

> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

m4uehu,,StockMarket,post,1615724733,"So I’ve been getting texts from friends and family all weekend saying they already got their stimulus checks. Keep in mind, none of these people were ever put out of work because of COVID and don’t need the check to survive.  They will use their checks to STIMULATE the local market by buying guns :) or some other expensive purchase or stick it into the stock market (like me).  I had pulled a decent amount of money out of the market when interest rates started to rise.  I think I’m going to put it back in for about another month while these checks roll out and then pull out as we worry about interest rates, rising gas prices, and inflation again...",I think the newest stimulus checks are going to provide a decent short term bump and here’s why.

m4u6go,,StockMarket,post,1615723856,"Last week saw some recovery for the hard hit tech and growth stocks as investors became slightly more comfortable with inflation forecasts, meaning US bond yields tapered off, which raised stock prices *(they essentially have an inverse relationship, as one rises, the other drops).* In addition, the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was completed by the US govt.

For some, reduced stock prices provided a buying opportunity, or at least an opportunity to average down the cost of some of the positions. 

I don’t expect us to be fully out of the woods yet in terms or recovery, with monday market opening likely to be red all over, as late on friday, bond yields jumped again following low demand for US govt bonds in auction *(when you take into account inflation, the yields on those bonds means you essentially have less money value than what you invested),* however, that should reduce by end of the week.

### Still bullish

Taking a step back and Looking at the overall market, this correction was not just healthy, but overdue. While some assets are still overpriced, overall economy recovery provide a good backdrop for further mark growth, at least in the short-medium term. This current period provides an opportunity to *“buy the dip“* on stocks which have a solid future, but also to reap the gain from some sectors that will see rapid growth over the next year. After all, rising inflation forecasts are due to the fact that most economists see the world economies recovering rapidly from the return of normality from COVID.

### What will be the recovering sectors?

In short, think of any the stocks that you have not been able to use or shop from over the last year.

# Buzzing stocks this week

I have created an algorithm that tracks chatter on social media to identify which stocks are trending, by measuring the shift in mentions this week compared to previous week. No GME or AMC here, meme stocks are purposely filtered out here.

[Stocks that have seen the biggest shift in chatter compared to previous week. No GME or AMC here, as they have had sustained chatter for months now.](https://preview.redd.it/ih1gydmlizm61.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2234c418454e15c24c1d846a1f20a35bba5e3014)

Here’s my commentary on the most interesting ones in there:

* **3D Systems, ticker: DDD**  
Since the time of writing and creating this graph, this stock has shot up **%4.2** and up another **%1.5** in pre-market. Down from All-time high from earlier this year, DDD benefitted from analyst upgrades last week, as its price suffered a big tumble. Furthermore, ARK initiated DDD position in ARKQ (Autonomous Technology & Robotics) ETF yesterday, putting it in the same basket as TSLA. Expect further gains short-term, and high volatility.
* **Accsys Technologies, ticker: AXS**  
This is a very interesting one, especially long-term. A sustainable wood company that produces high technology, alloy-like wood, planting a tree for every one it chops down. Has recently completed the building of 2 large production factories. I might even cover this on a separate article. ***Note:*** *This company has a small market cap, meaning a low number of shares traded, which means it could take longer than you’d like to buy/sell your shares.*
* **Vermilion Energy Inc, ticker: VET**  
Saw a price jump as analysts upgraded its price target last week. Energy companies are rising as demand is forecast to increase over the next few months. Not sure how this one will move in the near-future, one to watch. 
* **Teradyne, ticker: TER**  
Another one seeing lots of chatter on the back of ARK positioning. This one is a very exciting prospect to me, and ticks A LOT of boxes, most importantly, very solid finances. The company saw Earnings per share *(total earnings of the company, divided by number of shares, the higher the better)* growth of 64% last year. 

### Summary

Expect a less wild ride next week than the last few weeks, but still with some turbulence. Reduced prices have created a number of opportunities, which are being picked up by the algorithm.

While there is likely still some downside in the market, longer-term I see a rosier picture, especially as economies recover and return to normality. I see now as an opportunity to purchase some opportunities at strategic prices, as well as a time to rotate into some of the recovery stocks, taking some profits from the growth/tech sectors along the way.

What are your plans for the week? Let me know in the comment section.

m4y2z6,,StockMarket,post,1615738567,"SUMO Logic Inc: SUMO Logic went public in September for $22.00 a share. The stock dipped as low $16.71 on October 26th, 2021, before their first earnings report on December 7th (Posted in detail below), after which shares pumped to a high of $46.37 by February 8th. SUMO’s analysts ratings are excellent, analyst coverage is largely solid, and despite offering softer than expected guidance amid their most recent earnings, little has changed as far as their prospects for high growth. Of course, I see many companies this earnings season claiming “uncertainty” as a result of underlying economic conditions. More often than not I assess they’re simply managing expectations so that they can continue overperforming analysts predictions.

SUMO guidance expects between $53.2M & $54.2M in revenue for the quarter ending this upcoming April, a return of 13-15% and an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share. Consensus analysts estimates called for $53.4M and a loss of 14 cents per share. Overall they expect to grow in revenue between $231-$235M by JAN2022, an increase of 14-16% YoY, while expecting an EPS loss of 40-50 cents a share (I believe this an extreme low ball assessment). Analysts expect $234.1M and a YoY adjusted loss of 51 cents per share by JAN2022. In all they’re beating their earnings and growing slightly faster than analysts expectations, although the street seems to expect much higher growth. And of course, so do I. In FY 2018 they had $68M in revenue. In FY 2019 they grew to $103M in revenue, and by FY 2020, $155.06M. In the year ending in JAN2021 they gained $202.6M.

I do not believe, given this company’s record and clientele, that they’re going to grow less than their expected rate. And while some critics believe that this space is overcrowded, I look through their growing list of customers and see some solid names. This is not likely to slow for SUMO any time soon and I am optimistic that their revenue may grow well beyond their YoY guidance. In short, little has changed to justify such a massive over-reaction (Remember they reported amid the market correction time frame) to their most recent earnings beat, and with COVID coming to an end, I expect revenue growth to be much higher than their lowball guidance. I see SUMO stock as oversold, I assess this three month low as a bullish set up, and I think it a great dip buying opportunity that only comes around once in a blue moon. This is why I am long SUMO, and as a result, I have set up a covered strangle to take advantage of recent volatility. If you’re into stock I recommend investing safely and slowly as recommend in THIS STRATEGY.

Of course, I could always be wrong. I welcome your comments and input below.

I buy a lot of speculative stocks, but I prefer ones that have future prospects where the risk is merely that I'd have to hold longer, instead of risking losing the money outright. Part of that is also dividing it up into a whole bunch of smaller positions, which isn't compatible with the P&D volatility play of the memers.👼",

I so far I have only bought ~ $1000 worth of stock from companies who's stock values appear low.
I am hoping with the stimulus checks they increase in value and I can make money off of them.

My question is are there extra fees with robinhood / etc when I will be trading the stocks?

I personally recommend fidelity. They have great research tool, so this will help you seek for companies that you want to find.

They have performance record for your portfolio, have much your portfolio made per month (or loss), how much dividend you got, how much contributions you put in, how much you withdraw, when & how much you’ll be getting dividend, how your each stock is made up in your account, and etc.

Most importantly they don’t screw around when you’re trying to make transactions. I have seen numerous amount of image of robinhood users who had their transaction cancel by Robinhood.

As for investing, use the search tool provided by fidelity to help you start. They also key statistic about how company are doing in numbers. Debt, EPS, growth comparison in general, and etc.

Good luck young investor. May the diamond hand be with you.",

m4ml69,gqv7q3c,StockMarket,comment,1615693532,"Don't sell your stock because you think it's a growth stock. Sell it because either:

 a) You feel the value it's dropped below is more or less permanent and is likely unrecoverable within the ROI time frame you've set for the stock. So the loss you've endured is acceptable because your money would be better served in other stocks gaining a return. 

 b) The stock has risen to such levels of overvalue and you expect that overvalution to be temporary. Normally if you sell in this case you should have an idea of where to put the funds next. And ideally what your selling represents the peak return you'd expect in a 5-10 year period.

 c) You need to liquidate the value for other reasons (retirement income, pay off a debt, buy something...etc)

d) It's generally underperfoming your expectations. Maybe it only rose 2% in 5 years with no dividend for instance. In this case your money is probably better in another investment if there is nothing giving you confident things will change. 

Ideally, if you do your job right you don't need to sell. You hold the stock until c). Some cases where you might sell early and do a) would be expectations of bankruptcy or going out of business. You might do b) for a number of reasons, but it's usually the most risky because it often requires timing the market. For instance, I sold Tesla at $800 because I suspect it will lose its value and had some other stocks I thought were good deals. Of course Tesla could keep going up and I may never get a chance to buy in again. That's the type of risk you take with b).

In other words, only sell if you expect to lose more money or the stock is underperforming your expectations. Market volatility scaring you isn't a good reason.",

m4fnyb,,StockMarket,post,1615670226,"Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

I have learned my lessons to do limit orders instead of market orders. However sometimes I find myself in positions where there might be a great sell off really fast. I go to put a limit order in and the price has already dropped even lower which means I end up having to change it and hope it goes through and losing money as I am going through this process. I have also thought about this and probably should set a sell limit order ahead of time in case something like this happens again (lesson learned)

With that out of the way I have a couple questions:

1.) Anybody ever had issues with limit orders not going through fully or at all even when the price hits your limit number? I find sometimes even though within Robinhood I set a sell limit, it will not fill at all or only partially fill. Is this all brokers apps in general or just RH?

2.) If there is a drop off in sells and I perform a market order, will the sell price be significantly lower than the price displayed since it is going down? I notice when I do a market order when the price is somewhat not so volatile the price is pretty accurate, however if there is volatility then its dramatically different, maybe actually more so for crypto within RH. I sold ETH when it showed $1,906 and it sold at $1,891 taking my profits from +$108 to $8. Is this again a downfall of RH ? Or just RH in crypto? Or just in general what would happen with any broker?",Quick question please about market and limit orders

There is a delay, to get real time it takes very, expensive services or something like a Bloomberg terminal. That means if the price is moving fast you may be SOL no matter what. 

My experience is that Robinhood has terrible execution times, but to be fair you have to take into account that there has to be a buyer or seller at your price point. Even when setting a limit. You set a limit for 1000 @ $100. But there is only a buyer for 500 @ $100 you may not fill or only partially fill. If you look at level 2 data, this is actually what you will see. 

When a sell off is happening. There is many more sellers than buyers, so someone is getting screwed. Real time buyers/sellers will be first (Pros) to fill, then brokers that don’t suck, all the way downtown to Robinhoods users. Reason Robinhood users get screwed the most is, they aren’t even trying to get you best price. They make their money off NOT getting you the best price, and pocketing the difference. It’s a business model used by others......but Robinhoods was also fined $60 or $65 million  over how shady they implement it. Anyways the model is ok ish for making trades, until you try to trade a fast moving stock. 


TL;DR: Robinhood is shady as they come. Yes it will happen with other brokers. Just not as bad or Often.",

m4nc3w,,StockMarket,post,1615694247,"Hey all,

Does anyone see value in $EBON?

It was one of the biggest gainers last week, up 35%.

The financials are on par with a glamour (promise of rainbows & sunshine) growth company. But could there be more to $EBON?

ABOUT THE COMPANY:

$EBON (Ebang Intl Holdings) core business is crypto mining rigs (small plug n' play boxes that mine crypto-currency and as the company declares, consume less power than their counterparts), recently they announced that they were also moving into the exchange business (such as Coinsbase, Coinspot, etc) and sentiment appears positive in their space for them and their products.

CATALYST:

With the currently Crypto goldrush, this company is essentially selling shovels to miners.

BTC (and other crypros) are clearly gaining momentum, naturally many are divided on this space. Some see a lack of intangible value, whilst the bulls see Crypto as an integral part of our future.

Their recent announcement of moving into the Crypto exchange business was most likely the catalyst behind the 35% increase in price, the exchange business will add another (more lucrative) segment to their business.

CASE FOR $EBON:

Personally, last week, a number of banks in our region were down, the institutions didn't announce 'why', but many suspect it was linked to another attack by hackers (like Solarwinds, or the recent attack on Microsoft).

I wondered if we were on a currency (Bitcoin or similar) which implicitly has been designed to be secure against this type of manipulation, on a public blockchain, events such as this would not occur.

As public sentiment shifts in greater numbers (possibly driven by greed) to adopt Crypto, $EBON will only see their business strengthen, in sales of their products and growth in the exchange business.

CASE AGAINST $EBON:

Naturally, the powers that be (banks, govts.) are fearful of this type of store of value (and rightfully so), simply because they cannot create more by the push of a button. Hence, BTC (or another blockchain Crypto) are inconvenient and will tax resources (power, admin, tech) to obtain more 'value' when governments require it. Hence taking us back to a Gold standard (backed by a physical store of value such as Gold) and in the case of Bitcoin by proof of work.

The IOU's type of fiat currency, as many argue, works well. Governments can create as much (or little) store of value as they desire, back by their country's financial output (GDP). When they step out of equilibrium, the currency increases or decreases in value, which they can control through levers such as Q.E. (Quantitive Easing). These will not be as easily available on a BTC blockchain (digital store of value, obtained only by proof of work) .

Companies like $EBON are operating in a space that will only see headwind from institutions and governments globally.

Based on its declared financials, $EBON is overvalued and will see slow growth as Crypto currency may largely remain (or be exiled) to the fringes.

CONCLUSION:

$EBON, at least in the short-term, has the potential to see growth (increased sales) fuelled by the current Crypto goldrush & their move into the exchange business.",Is there value in $EBON?

m49gqi,,StockMarket,post,1615652294,"**Tech stocks**

I’ve been back and fourth constantly this year on the next direction in stocks. This isn’t normal for me, it’s a product of the conditions that are at hand. Prices are elevated on fed support. Natural forces are trying to correct, but are unable to make real progress. We've seen a good correction in tech and momentum stocks in the last few weeks, but other indexes continue to push higher. Until their is a broad correction or consolidation I will continue to day trade as I am too cautious about holding anything long-term. If we see a breakout in tech, that will confirm the bubble and I will buy the breakout and hold.

**Dollar**

The dollar needs to continue its bounce higher before its next move down too. Bearish bets on the dollar reached extremes and time or a large spike higher is needed to gear up for another move lower. A move to new highs on the EUR/USD will signal another phase of appreciation in stocks and metals. I don't expect that to happen immediately. As long as the dollar is rising I'm happy to be in cash waiting for the right opportunity.

**Silver**

Silver remains stuck in a range. After the silver squeeze didn’t force a breakout above $30 it was clear that controlling forces weren’t going to allow it to take off immediately. I still believe a move higher is coming, but more correction and sentiment wash-out is needed before that happens. I’m keeping an eye on some of the new PSLV pumpers to see when their focus shifts. Once many of them give up silver will be ready to take off.

**Gold, gold miners, and platinum**

Gold is still much worse off than silver. It’s been in a downtrend since August and has been forcefully rejected on two big breakout attempts. It typically dominates the metals market and others are pulled in its direction. Like silver, it is being held down. 

A tell-tale sign is to watch miner price activity along with the price of gold. Miners are more volatile than gold when it moves up or down and can often front-run the next direction in gold. I’m watching price action in GDX, GDXJ, leveraged versions of those securities, and some other individual miners to possibly telegraph the start of the next move. Breakouts in miners could signal the buying opportunity.

I also watch platinum for similar cues. Like tech stocks, it has been weaker than I would like on this bounce. It and other metals have to correct, consolidate, or show a forceful move higher on volume before I’m interested. I’m ok with missing the initial move to break out in all metals. If they suddenly jump, there will be plenty my if room to run higher in a short amount of time. I will be ready to buy, even if it seems like I've ""missed the move"".

**Oil**

Oil continues to be in the late stage of a bull run. It’s hard to stay on the sidelines and focus on other things when other traders seem to be making easy money. I made plenty in oil. I bought OIH in November when oil was at 45, and held to 60. Trying to capture another 10% or so from here isn't worth it for me.

As a general rule, when price appreciates too fast, I see too much risk of a sudden move down. These moves can erase weeks of gains in days and traders keep buying thinking it’s just another dip. I like to wait until technicals cycle back down before buying. It means I miss out on some big final moves higher, but those moves are often unpredictable and can reverse at any moment. Calling a top isn’t possible so I prefer to decide when I’ve made “enough” and focus in other areas.

Follow your plan,

On the other hand, if i dont see the market may drop and I lose my chance to make money. 

Not all of us want to hold the index funds forever. So my question is directed at those of you wo have been into index investing for a long time.

Also, the two I’ve mentioned are traditionally known for retirement accounts, especially Vanguard. Why go with a newer company like WeBull whose main focus is stocks + options?

That being said, it’s really easy to transfer your IRA to Vanguard or Fidelity (but takes about 2 weeks). The process to transfer an account always begins with the receiving institution. All you wanna do is call the company’s customer service line and tell them you have a Roth at Webull, and they’ll take care of transferring it for you once you fill out some paperwork.

m472uf,gqsy6ml,StockMarket,comment,1615647994,"Thank you for your thoughtful analysis and continuing to advocate for RAD. It appears Rite Aid has again found its footing and is once again on an upward trajectory. Buying RAD during the recent dip into the $18 territory would have already rewarded the investor handsomely. From $24, if it reaches the $32 level of January, it will once again be a rewarding purchase. Too many on wsb have formed an opinion of RAD based on the past, and I don't blame them. It has been a skunk among stocks in the past. But that is the past, and Rite Aid now looks more like a diamond in the rough. Smart money appears to be quietly accumulating RAD for the last several months. It would not be surprising in the coming weeks to see the price double from the recent $18 level. Doubles aren't too shabby, and this stock has multiple reasons to run further.",

Cars. Internet provider, phone and computer maker, food, clothing, how and where you buy them. Bank used, insurance, entertainment, places to eat, ways to travel.... Most of these companies publicly traded. Buy 5-10 of them reinvest the dividends. Read all the books and articles suggested and more. Nothing beats having real money in play watching it grow sometimes pull back etc. As you get more knowledge and money allocate 10-20 % of your money to speculation and new companies. I highly suggest not putting it all in one stock and following Reddit traders until you get some experience. Those of us who do well and have been for awhile have made many mistakes and had many loses. Learned our lessons. No matter how good any trader is there will always be mistakes, mistiming, loses at certain times. Investing and trading very much more psychological than the math.. One of my favorite sayings from a Billions episode, “ good traders know to get out of s bad trade but great traders can do a 180 go the other way and make money” So many want to be right and double triple down on a loser. In stead of simply acknowledging they are wrong and go other way. This will be down the road when you learn to profit when companies go down using options.

Why is this? The EY is now decreasing slowly. 

This is what I'm seeing when I look at this chart:

* During the March 2000 - 2002 downturn, in which the markets shed about 40% of value, the EY actually was at a very low in March 2002. But this was a very good time to get into the market, since it started rising after that.

* During the 2008 Great Recession, the EY hit a minimum around May 2009. This was also a very good time to get back into the market. 

**Why didn't the Recession of 2020 not have this signal?**

**Also, usually, the markets are a ""good deal"" when the EY is high. But in this case, we're seeing why it's good to buy when the EY is low.** Explain this paradox, please.","According to my analysis, it's best to buy AFTER a correction when the EY is LOW (not high).

m4bayz,gqtph0o,StockMarket,comment,1615662471,"The way I see it, when the prices are lowest, that's during the correction. Then it should rebound and stabilize, that's after the correction.

The signal is different for a bunch of reasons:

1. this was a crash based on external factors, not a market cycle.
2. it was broad-band and affected most industries, and the impact was highly uncertain.
3. gold and bonds were not viable safe havens, so after the crash everybody piled into a handful of growth stocks as an artificial haven

This results in a situation now where EY is already low before the correction, because of stock inflation/bubble. I advise against taking historical signals at face value right now. Search for meaning, and apply the meaning yourself.  Most people will have it wrong either way, but it gives you a chance. That said, historical rotation cycles still apply.

After some research and talking with a coworker, I learned my best option would be to put money into an index fund. I don't have a tremendous amount of time to research individual stocks and from what I learned index funds typically will compound at a solid rate over several years. I am 28 now and my goal is to have this money for retirement. I currently am contributing to a 401k but I have some spare money that I would like to start growing (and I just got my annual bonus).

1. So my first questions is, am I correct that an index fund is the best bet for what my goal is?
2. I have seen a lot of ""ranked lists for best index funds"" but every one of them is different and I can't get a concise idea of what to choose. What index funds would you recommend and why?
3. I initially set up an account on Robinhood but after reading things from Reddit, I think I'll close it (once I get back to even). I bank with Chase so I thought it would be a great idea to set up an account with JP Morgan You Invest (no transfer fees as far as I know). I don't much care for it because it seems cumbersome to navigate, isn't really user friendly, and researching sucks; but it's linked to my bank account and transferring money is quick and easy. Should I invest the index fund on You Invest since it'll essentially be a ""set it and forget it"" type of thing and then do individual stocks on something like Fidelity or eTrade? Or would you recommend keeping it all together on one brokerage?
4. How do the expense ratios work for an index fund? I understand the fund manager will charge a percentage annually but how is it billed? Does it come out of the shares you own or do they send you something in the mail or another way?
5. I heard the safe way to put money into an index fund is dollar cost averaging. Would you agree with this? Or is the market at a point where it really won't matter?
6. What type of account should I make it? Standard brokerage account, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA? I really hope I won't need this money so having to pull it out early and paying taxes shouldn't be an issue.

I really appreciate the help and any further advice is welcome!",Index Fund help

The tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020 are faring worse this year. Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.

Investors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.

The weakness sets up a ""great entry point"" for investors interested in [**Apple**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest), Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. The firm added Apple to its ""best ideas"" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a ""game-changer"" that extends the upgrade ""supercycle"" for another year, Ives said.

""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,"" he added.

Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.

Wall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.

The bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.

The upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.

While this number is subject to change, the reports hint at ""an increased confidence with Cook & Co. that this 5G product cycle"" will continue into next year, Ives said.

Apple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts.","Apple is a 'best idea' pick that can rally up to 86% as tech stocks rebound, Wedbush says $AAPL"

In the US, currently estimated with a few million families behind on rent. Even in the expensive state like California, the average is about 2% of household behind on rent with average amount of just $4500. That’s barely $400 million for California’s. Now scale that up at 2% of all households in entire US and say each household is behind by $20000, that will be an amount of $50 billion. 

Honestly, on scale of economy, $50 billion is practically peanuts. I mean take just Tesla for example, it gains and dropped well over $100 billion in valuation in one week. Also, 20k per household debt is nothing, average college graduates incur more debt than that. In the same time frame, US household saving rate is at record high at over 20%, that amount translates to a whopping $4000 extra saving per person. So there seems to be a lot of assets growth as comparing to debt. Of course the distribution is making economic inequality even worse.

So why is this described as a crisis? I can understand humanitarian aspect, but what’s going on there.","Impending eviction crisis?

m3rzer,,StockMarket,post,1615585536,"Stocks traded mixed on Friday, with technology stocks coming under pressure once again as Treasury yields resumed their march forward. The Dow extended gains from yesterday, hitting fresh intraday records. The S&P 500 (SPY) opened in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to finish modestly green.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to reach a fresh, one year high at 1.628%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.”

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

m3x6ip,,StockMarket,post,1615602643,"*Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means).

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine.

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending)

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans.

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high.

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.**

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it.

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector.

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me.

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”*

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues.

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.*

Now that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier?

*Now consider this:*

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f)

If you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower.

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu

**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous.

A few things to think about:

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird.

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving\*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much\* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk.

Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators had a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba.  Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations - they even ""disappeared"" him for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock got dragged down by the bears anyway despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Is the price already too high?**  
No.  The p/e is sub 10.  The stock has risen a lot lately, true, but it was significantly undervalued before due to pressure on the Chinese fintech industry as a whole. Not to mention, the revenue / loan origination group is continuing - this ain't no late-cycle boomer stock. In other words, just because a banana tree triples in value doesn't mean it isn't still undervalued, especially if it now makes quadruple the bananas. 

**Any big banana showers coming soon?**  
YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet.

If you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon.

TLDR: I like the stock.

*This is obviously not financial advice.*

*Positions: long 15 QFIN 3/19 calls 35 strike, and long 500 shares (cost basis $27.48)*

I recently opened an individual account to trade and then learned more in trading with a ROTH IRA though fidelity. I would like to hold them long term in that account . I currently have no capital gains in Webull unfortunately, so would I get hit with taxes ? I was wondering if selling my stock and getting in a new position with ARK ETFs is a smarter move with my ROTH IRA in fidelity. I understand I can have transfer fees waived if I just asked. If I transferred I believe I would only be able to transfer to individual fidelity account",Transfer from Webull to fidelity. ARK ETF
m40gkk,gqs0bxk,StockMarket,comment,1615618230,"I think you're asking about moving a non-roth holding at webull to a roth holding at fidelity.

Unfortunately, I don't believe there is any way to move anything into a roth other than cash.  Which means you have to sell the ARK funds to do so and re-buy in the Roth.

If you're close to even on the ARK funds (I.E. have neither a loss or a gain) this is pretty straightforward - just sell and buy.   However if you have either a loss or a gain, then there is a bigger issue:

NOTE THAT I AM NOT A TAX EXPERT AND THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE COMPLETELY WRONG.  This is more of a 'watch out for this' than specific advice:

If there's a gain, you'll end up paying taxes on your profit when you sell them.   The amount of taxes will depend on the amount of profit and how long you held them and your tax rate.

If there's a loss, normally you'd be able to deduct this from your income, subject to various limitations.   Or deduct it from other profits.   However, if you sell and re-buy then this is subject to wash-sale rules which means the IRS will disallow the deduction as they think you're just trying to avoid taxes.   Worse, when  you re-buy in a tax-advantaged (aka Roth) account the portion of the wash-sale rules which allows you to roll the loss into the new security isn't applicable since there is no way to deduct a loss in a Roth holding.

So, you either have to not get the tax advantage of selling a security at a loss, or you have to separate your sale from \*ANY\* purchase of the fund by 31+ days, before or after the sale.   I.E. you can't buy it first in the Roth, then sell it in the Webull account within 31 days.  You have to instead either sell it, wait the 31+ days, and then re-buy, OR buy it in the Roth first, and then wait 31 days before selling it in the Webull account.

Note that if instead of it being a Roth account it's just a normal account at Fidelity, then you can just get them to move it without selling.   Or if they're both Roth accounts.   You just can't move from one account type to another.",

m3kr02,gqpkn5h,StockMarket,comment,1615569720,"Interest rates affect stock prices in 2 key ways:

1. Growth--and thus future earnings--is often fuelled by debt.  Cheaper debt means more potential growth, or else safer growth without that spectre of huge debt repayments hanging over them.

2. Company stock prices are based on the current value of expected future earnings.  When interest rates are higher future earnings have less value (since the difference between the company earnings and the safe bonds returns is now less), and so the current stock price will drop.  The more that the current stock price is based on high future earnings growth rates, the more that an interest rate increase will reduce their stock price.

The 10-yr in particular is looked at because that falls more into line with pricing future earnings into current stock prices than things like the 5-yr or 30-yr do.  However, the focus can change a bit depending on economic/market conditions, though the 10 yr is typical.",

I wanted to share some experiences I've had with people I coach (which I don't offer anymore mostly because of what I will write now) and hope it helps at least one person focus on what **really** matters before day trading as a career.

One of the real privileges of having a trading blog (no link so don't ban me) is I get to talk to and answer questions about common trading ""issues"" from all walks of life, countries and backgrounds.

As in trading, as in life, I notice some very peculiar patterns developing in my conversations. Specifically, what people are struggling with and how they grapple with the paradox that is trading. In many cases, system problems become emotional problems and then the emotional problems ruin the system. It's a vicious circle.

Even though we are all from various walks of life, **a few commonalities show up in coaching and sharing sessions:**

1. Some are in a challenging financial situation - with either too much or not enough money (yes some people have too much money, first world problems).
2. The wealthy ones are trading to relieve boredom and actually have gambling addictions in disguise - something my own psychologist pointed out
3. Some are under pressure with money and trading is an escape to riches which leads to going too heavy too soon and destroying their account and confidence
4. Many have very ingrained beliefs about the market before they trade which keep them stuck in faulty beliefs about wealth and trading
5. Few (myself included) want to hear the actual truth about their system and don't do the hard stuff like a trading journal, around 5% of people log their trades
6. Few people practice and back test trading.
7. Very few if any have a written plan and process on which to escape the 9 to 5

The biggest commonality of all being, **everyone expects it to be far easier than it is.** Particularly those who made a ton quickly and then lost it again. Seldom does anyone have a tangible plan, written down with cash flows, costs, expenses or a vision of what trading full time really is.

Most people want to be trading at Super Performance level but haven't even managed their own household finances (if you feel attacked by this statement maybe there is some truth?).

Most people want to hit 1000% annual returns (who wouldn't) before they understand core concepts about savings, cash flow and trading stocks as an actual business.

**Not all foundations are the same**

Many of the mental and financial foundations I've found are quite loosely defined, something okay when tinkering with stocks, not okay when your kids depend on it.

Having gone through this metamorphosis myself, I think that most of underlying issues are the same. There are a few pillars to creating a realistic **trading business** **plan** that people need to consider - both psychological and financial, they are inextricably linked in fact. *Excuse if I am preaching here but I know from personal and very painful experiences, what works and what doesn't!*

**Your** **Psychology and Income**

I've written before about [what it takes to trade from a cash-flow perspective](https://blog.redpilltrades.com/how-much-do-i-need-to-trade-for-a-living/) but seldom write about the stress(es) it takes to get there. If you have a situation where you are trading to live, the impact on your psychology is constant both conscious and sub-consciously:

1. You can't guarantee the market will provide a recurring return which results in worrying about trading before you have started trading. More on Fear and trading found here in depth.
2. In the back of your mind there is always a ""plan B"" to ""go back to work if it doesn't work out"" ,which in essence lays the foundation for being okay with ultimate failure. If you anticipate you can go back, it's easy to let mistakes into the plan.
3. Dollar amounts become tied to items, events or experiences where you ""could have used the money"". If are trading a 100k account and not used to it. You could equate a 1% loss to losing a trip away with your wife and kids.

**The Income Itself**

I've written in depth about what it takes to trade for a living from a cashflow perspective but really need to hammer it home. The full article can be found here.

The thing is, I've traded for a living whilst I had a mortgage and also traded for a living without having a mortgage (paid off mortgage). In my early trading days I was far too inconsistent to pay any mortgage reliably based on trading.

It is impossible to separate these thoughts particularly if you are new to trading and are just in it to make money. One of the best decisions I made in trading was to stop focusing on the money and begin fine tuning the actually process.

Far more new traders should be focusing on saving and **building a nest of assets before they even consider trading.** That doesn't mean ""don't trade"" - it means stop smoking hopium and realise that if you really want this, it takes time and quite a lot of time. The tuition of trading can be steep, if you aren't ready for it then save longer, trade less and develop skills not ""wishes""

**Trading Whilst Holding High Interest Debt**

The thing about traders is. we are inherently interested in compounding our gains and having a statistical advantage in our favor to make money over time. In essence, making compounding our biatch and running our system day in and day out.

Debt is basically the exact same principle, only the money goes into someone else's pocket.

Just as positive compounding works with you, debt at high interest compounds against you. It would be the same as having a trading account that is **guaranteed to lose say 5 or even 15% per year!** Even worse, imagine taking our a loan and your trading account goes south. You are now tied into monthly payments, are down the money itself and can't find new opportunities to trade... because you never have any money.

Trading whilst holding debt is absolutely and unequivocally insane! Particularly if that debt has high interest. One of the most fundamental things we can do as traders is exercise basic financial prudence **before** trying to beat the best minds in finance to make money.

**Creating a Solid Foundation on Which to Trade or Invest**

There are far too many hurdles both financially and psychologically for anyone to hold huge debt and not hold basic financial literacy... and then trade. Somehow, that is who the target audience is for most brokerage firms.

Not only do you risk losing more than you invested, you could put yourself in a financial hole which takes years to recover from and will turn trading into something very ugly indeed. The long term damage isn't always obvious at face value but can creep into relationships, habits and things outside of trading.

A sound foundation on which to ramp up your trading efforts looks more like the below:

1. No overhead or high interest debts - exception is a mortgage that is well proportioned to your income and easily managed.
2. Suggestion is mortgage insurance if it is cost effective in your country.
3. Create and budget for realistic costs associated with trading. Write this down and create plans to get there. Turn the dream into something tangible.
4. Have an emergency budget. Just in case things go poorly, it's always good to have backup, for me, at least 12 months of living expenses is a minimum.

Although less apparent and tangible, one thing I must include in a solid trading foundation is... your wife, partner or network of friends.

As trading is a holistic pursuit, surrounding yourself with the right kind of people is hyper important.

Even if you have the financial plans in place, your trading environment, where you live, what you eat, your physical health and other environmental considerations can come in to play, some very high level suggestions:

1. Cut your losses with toxic relationships. Is someone is weighing you down or even worse - telling you what you want to hear! Seek truth in relationships.
2. Make sure your trading office is clean, including files desktop and workspace.
3. Keeping a clean and well balanced diet, reducing caffeine and stimulants which impact mood, adding complex carbs and reducing ""quick fix"" sugars which impact emotional state.
4. Keep a journal.

I want to avoid over-complicating this write-up as many of these foundational aspects of trading seem obvious, even though they might be obvious at face value, few execute on them in reality.

Far too many people pursuing trading ""dreams"" have a weak financial foundation, hide trading from their partners (due to losses) and dig a very deep hole that is hard to escape.

As traders and investors, it's up to us to deal with and take full accountability for our trading results. The most obvious prerequisite of this being - a solid, simple and well thought out foundation on which to build.

Simple systems are always the best. Having a nest from which to fly makes all the difference both in a solid foundation and long term career in trading stocks.

If you spent the time reading this - hope it helps. I love trading but damn, I wish someone had this chat with me BEFORE I lost my first few K

That you're calling people names (""crooks"") means you're getting emotional over your trades, and lashing out irrationally. This is not wise.💡

These are failed companies that don't have business activities. If you hold their stocks, you likely lost your money. If you bought these stocks recently, you bought stocks in a company that had already failed and ceased business practices; that means you not only didn't do your due diligence, you didn't do any diligence.

Diligence is a verb. Just as here, you're not doing your due diligence in understanding what the March 12th date was about.

Why is this shitty stock going to go up while globalstar doesn't ? The last fucking 5 years seems to matter more then anything... Globalstar has better deals then any fucking penny stock deal right now -_- The stock is BIOL, it will go to $2+ because check MVIS and XELA they did the same thing has BIOL the last 5 years very high price . MVIS went from $1 and change to $20+ Seems like the jackpot stocks takes longer to support the growth steady and not crash long term.

Now look at GSAT, it has deals in billions, it has a global market cap of high billions or trillions.

But because the last 5 years the highest price was $2.61 and the last 7 years was $4.54..

This stock just won't go until May or June because of the last 5 years pricing..

It's like the shitty company has to give back to the market to survive due to compliances and bounce back up on low shitty million dollars deals because they were 
$25+++ in the last 5 years...

BIOL is going to $2-$4 with a shitty deal, last 5 years $9
MVIS went from $1 and change to over $20 because it had $400 a share at one point and it traded in the $30-40 level before 2012.

XELA went up because last 5 years over $25 per share.

Are we playing a game of just guessing how high it's going to go because fundamental analysis for playing that game DOESNT SEEM TO MATTER",Manipulation to the finest?

I have been working on improving the program and **have made the program public**. If you have seen the previous posts, please feel free to skip to the DD.

**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth.

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: Rocket Companies ($RKT)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: 2332%

Month on Month increase in mentions: 1265.1%

Average sentiment across mentions: +14.2%

**Core Product**

Rocket is headquartered in Detroit and was founded in 1985. Their business model involves much more than just rapidly processing mortgages. They leverage analytics to provide real-time quotes to clients and provides end-to-end visibility into their transactions.

Rocket operates both a direct-to-consumer business and a partner network which expands the platform’s reach. Their major divisions include:

**Rocket Mortgage:** This is Rocket’s main division which contributes to the bulk of its revenue. They are the largest mortgage lender in the US closing more than $1 Trillion in home loans since their inception.

**Rocket Homes:** Online home search platform and real estate agent referral network.

**Rocket Auto:** An asset-light auto sales platform.

**Rocket Loans:** Personal loan platform that operates similar to the core mortgage business.

**Amrock:** Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and settlement services.

Although only less than 10% of the revenue is generated from their non-core businesses, these products have the potential to grow faster than traditional mortgage in the future. Their ultimate aim is to provide a one-stop ecosystem for a wide range of financial products.

**Financials**

Rocket, like other mortgage companies, had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.

Revenue increased 144% y-o-y to $4.7 Billion in their fourth quarter and net income increased 277% to $2.8 Billion. They also announced a special dividend of $1.11 per share. In FY’20 they had $320 Billion in loan originations with total revenue of $15.7 Billion (208% increase). Their net income for 2020 was $9.3B (948% more than 2019). They have a very strong cash position with total liquidity of $7.7 Billion.

Rocket also increased gain on sale margin by 100 basis points year-over-year to 4.41%. Rocket Auto, their retail marketplace facilitated the sale of 9,400 auto units - Up more than 2,000 units as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Rocket homes assisted their clients with $1.6 B real estate transactions just in Q4’20.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Interest rates:** The Fed is currently pumping an insane amount of money into the economy and holding the interest rates down. The current interest rates are some of the lowest ever in recent history. Almost everyone who has a mortgage is refinancing it since the rates have basically halved over the past year.

**Covid and Stay at home restrictions:** Rocket is currently the leading provider of online mortgages. Given that a large majority of people are currently stuck at home/unwilling to go out, if they want to refinance their loans, Rocket would end up as their primary option. This is accelerated as more and more young people who prefer online marketplaces start buying their houses.

**Customer retention:** Rocket has amazing customer service (Predominantly due to their company culture, AKA ‘[ISMs](https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies)’) with a client retention rate of 92%. Their recapture rates were 82% for refinance transactions. This is an important metric since Rocket is foraying into other sectors such as homes and auto and will easily be able to cross-sell their products.

**Risk and Competition**

The main risks associated with Rocket are

**Mortgage rates:** The current refinancing boom is due to rock bottom mortgage rates. Any substantial increase in these rates would drastically affect both the revenue and the bottom line of the company. The company’s short-term prospects are almost completely dependent on the Fed.

**Sale Margins:** The current jump in the margin for Rocket is predominantly due to the low mortgage rates as well as the huge demand for refinancing the mortgages. This led to loan originators restricting the demand by not decreasing their offered rates in line with their funding costs, which enabled them to improve their sale margins.

**Internal ownership:** The open market holds less than 10% of the total shares. So, if the insiders convert and sell even 10% of the ownership, the outstanding shares will double and can cause the stock price to drop.

**UWMC’s Announcement:** UWMC during a recent event announced that it would no longer work with real estate brokers doing business with Rocket Companies. The full and long-term impact of this announcement is not yet clear and can impact Rocket adversely in the near future.

**Conclusion**

I deliberately left out the short interest and the short squeeze play as I believe it would be extremely difficult to time it if it ever happens. Rocket, with its emphasis on technology and outstanding customer service, is in a good position to gain market share in the mortgage market. On the flip side, the company is heavily dependent on the mortgage rates and on how long the refinancing boom would continue. I believe the company is undervalued given the explosive growth in revenue and future prospects of all their associated platforms!

m3nd0z,,StockMarket,post,1615572504,"This is obvious to most on here, I am sure. I am new to this I am trying to wrap my mind around what is the best strategy here for a day trade move.

Here is the hypothetical setup: 

I buy 10 shares for a $100 a piece ($1000). A breakout happens and a share soars to $125 ($1250) right before a potential dip.  I went from my average cost of $1000 to a net gain of $250. Should I sell ALL 10 shares at this peak for $1250 or should I only sell 2 shares at the total value of my $250 gain and use that to amount to buy back on the dip??

It makes more sense to me to sell from my new profit on the gain instead of redistributing the total equity I initially invested. Besides, if the stock continues to grow I would potentially just lose value in the equity of my original investment at $1000. Say, if I sold all shares at $1250 and bought back in on a  dip of $1000 .... Also, this is based on non-commission trades.

Anyway, what are your thoughts or",Obvious to most... Sell SOME shares or ALL before buying on the dip??
m3nd0z,gqpueau,StockMarket,comment,1615574073,I think the difficulty will be to predict the Moment of the dip. „Buying and selling at the right time“,
m3nd0z,gqpzset,StockMarket,comment,1615576528,"Obviously if you know where the top is, you should sell all and buy back on the dip. The problem is you don't know. In reality, something like this is more likely to happen:  

1: Company goes from 100 to 125. 

2: You sell all and wait for the dip. 

3: Company goes from 125 to 150. 

4: You admit your mistake and buy back in at 150. 

5: Company dips back to 125.",
m3nd0z,gqq0m23,StockMarket,comment,1615576908,"I think many advisors recommend selling half of your position if you are trying to time an exit at the top and lock in some profits. That way when you're wrong (which you will be most of the time) you still have part of your original position to participate if the stock continues to go up.

And if your right, you have the cash to buy the dip.",
m3nd0z,gqpwu87,StockMarket,comment,1615575174,As busquets mentioned you never know the top of the growth and the bottom of the dip.

m3nd0z,gqqg6kf,StockMarket,comment,1615584217,"Selling two shares at 125$ would net a 50$ gain not a 250$ gain.

Basis is 100, gain of 125, adjusted gain is 25$ per share. Or something like that I do tax law not taxes.

So with that extra 50$ you’d buy an extra “half” share if you could. If fractional shares arnt a thing you’d want to either keep the 50$, save it for future investment or sell enough shares to where the gain = enough to buy additional shares.

If I’m a long term investor I’d sell all of them and try to buy back in on a dip. Just hard to time the dip. No one could guess Tesla would drop as hard as it did this past week.",

I believe that senior management will be inspired and led in much the same way that EGO was under Paul; GAU is quickly becoming a competitive junior miner. 

I believe Paul’s connections to EGO will help this miner navigate the junior gold world, and his experience with operating mines in different parts of the world give him a good understanding for how to anticipate geo-political issues and take advantage of costs (labor, energy).

If I buy 100 shares of DMYI now, how do those shares work once IonQ starts trading under its own ticker symbol? Do shares DMYI convert to IONQ shares? Do I retain DMYI and indirectly reap the profits from their successful launch of IONQ IPO? Do I need to separately purchase IONQ shares?

If I've made any errors in assumption or missed a key question, please feel free to educate me further.",

Especially with such Insanely high implied volatility. Would you buy a gas station scratch ticket for $2,000 if the max jackpot was only like 5-10 grand? Liquidity is so low rn that dude who spent 90k on calls could've just bought shares and it would've had a pretty nice impact on price. How many 10s of millions of dollars did retail traders just dump directly into the pockets of the very same Market Makers who are fucking us? Wasn't too difficult for them to keep the price at $260 (the exact price where the most Calls AND puts finish OTM) with only 22 mil volume and negligible upward pressure. There were about 80,000 800cs bought this week. At an average price of $500 per, guess how much cash that is?.... $40,000,000. Hundreds of millions were spent on strike prices over $300.

I’m seeing a lot of wildlife donations and I’m pissing my pants with excitement as a conservation biologist. 

To everyone donating and sponsoring animals you have no idea how much you’re helping. Typically, countries that contain high levels of endangered apes are lower on the GDP scale and have very little funding so the influx of even a tiny bit of cold hard cash to these foundations is going to have a positive cascading effect on the local ecosystem. I’m not sure how many fellow conservationists there on WSB/GME but I’d like to thank you personally for the positive impacts you have/will make. 

I thought I would throw my two cents in and suggest some highly effective NGO’s that do miracles. My passion is African wildlife so all the NGOs listed will have major projects within African countries and yes most have projects that protect apes. I am in no way connected to any of these organisations I just know the work they do is important. 

*\*\*This is not financial advice; I am not a financial advisor just a gibbon with a keyboard. Please do your own research when donating to any charities\*\**

[https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/GeneralDonatecopy1/index.html](https://fosseyfund.salsalabs.org/GeneralDonatecopy1/index.html)

These guys a popular choice to choose when sponsoring endangered apes directly on here. Funding goes directly to anti-poaching/research/education and local communities (highly important). Their C.E.O has already thanked WSB personally:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a\_message\_to\_wsb\_from\_the\_director\_of\_the\_dian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/)

This is personal: Earlier this year 6 gorilla rangers were shot and killed here on January 12th  in an ambush. There are poor countries in Africa, then there’s the Congo – it receives very little help and small donations would be a huge fucking help. You can choose to adopt a fellow ape and the money would go towards helping the entire park protect our brothers and sisters.

 

**3. African Parks**

These guys are kings in what they do and probably the most important on this list. They're taking long term control of natural areas across the continent and provide protection and management to over 40,000 square miles (roughly the size of Germany). Their work involves all aspects of park management, from research projects to anti-poaching. Africa parks will be responsible for preserving green spaces in Africa for years to come.

In honour of HeyItsPixeL FZS is a German-based NGO with a focus on conserving biodiversity and protecting wilderness areas through multiple projects around the globe – a really efficient organisation and industry renown for effective strategies.

If you guys are lucky enough to go and see wild predators in Africa in 20 years it’ll be largely due to the work these guys do. This South Africa NGO uses applied research to maintain predator and bird of prey species populations within and around protected areas. Projects are primarily in South Africa but are expanding to other African countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. Personally working for these guys would be my dream job.



**6. Elephants Without Borders**

I’ve seen a couple of elephants been sponsored in the name of GameStop and would love to nominate this NGO as a candidate for anyone willing. Primarily these guys operate within Botswana (the country with the highest population of elephants in the world and also known for its  💎's). The African elephant population is bearish, to say the least – these guys are doing great things to try and bring it back up.

&#x200B;

**7. Naankuse Foundation Wildlife Sanctuary**

This is the only wildlife sanctuary that I know of that I would put on the list. Naankuse started by saves predators (mainly cheetahs) that have been captured by farmers that would otherwise shoot them for eating their livestock. Now they’ve grown into a huge ecotourism organisation that I would recommend volunteering with if you want to get up close with African wildlife.

&#x200B;

**8. Jane Goodall Institute** 🦍

Finishing the list with the queen of Primatology herself Jane Goodall. The institute provides sanctuaries in multiple countries for apes that have been affected by poaching or wildlife conflict for rehabilitation and hopefully release.  Jane Goodall herself has made a huge impact on ape populations across Africa and probably responsible for countless wild populations of chimpanzees

&#x200B;

**Final appreciation**

I wanted to thank you all of you apes – I’ve chosen a field of work that I love but will never make me rich but when GME takes off, I’ll continue perusing my dream of helping African wildlife but after visiting different galaxies onboard the monkey expresses I’ll be able to contribute way more than I ever could thanks to you guys. 

But remember the only ticket on the monkey express to the baboon galaxy is diamond hands baby – hold not for my dreams but for your own!  🚀

Where is the media coverage on this?

With the advent of the ecological crisis forcing 10,000 - 100,000 species on the brink of extinction each year (WWF), this philanthropic movement from WSB should be headlining the news everywhere.

If you do a quick google search wallstreetbets and donations, nothing pops up regarding the recent generous movement. Just wanted to point out how filtered media outlets are as it seems like they only post stories that contribute to the narrative that WSB is some kind of collective hive mind bent on manipulating the market... when WSB has probably done more good in these past months than those big corporations have in their lifetimes.

Edit2: Snek


Ishimwe was born into Mafunzo’s group on July 16, 2015. His name means “praise” or “gratitude.”
His father is Mafunzo (who is himself the grandson of Effie) and his mother is Taraja (the daughter of Titus and granddaughter of Uncle Bert).
Ishimwe was the first surviving infant in Mafunzo’s group, and for that reason the favorite of his father, but there are now also two other gorillas close in age to Ishimwe: Ukwiyunga and Umutware. The three youngsters are inseparable.
Ishimwe initially struggled when his mother gave birth again when he was just three. Taraja gradually pushed Ishimwe to be independent and stopped nursing, but she still cuddled with him for long grooming sessions, which for gorillas is reassuring and calming. He is now a fantastic older brother to Suraurwanda (whose name means “visit Rwanda”) and was born in November 2018.",

Rangers are the people who hunt the poachers, they are the heroes that sleep next to the elephants at night and shoot anyone who tries to hurt them. They usually live at the park not seeing their own families for months, poorly funded and they're constantly murdered- six rangers at Virunga Park were killed in January this year already.

m4qnhj,,wallstreetbets,post,1615707315,"We all know that Gorillas are endangered. But did you know that there are only 1000 Mountain Gorillas worldwide. 

This means that if every WSB user adopted 0.00015 gorrilas, we could completely corner the market on gorillas. 

This means that every single Gorilla in the world would be safe and looked after. 

However Gorillas are not the only great ape with volume issues. There are 7500 Sumatran orangutans worldwide. So once we corner the Gorilla market, it wouldn't take much to corner the Orangutan market either. To adopt every single Orangutan each WSB user needs to adopt 0.001 Orangutan. 

Infact we could buy up the entire Great Ape Market. There are approximately 500,000 great apes around the world Orangutans, Gorrilas, Chimpanzees ect. That means each WSB user needs to adopt only 0.071 of them to adopt them all. 

What do we do with the apes once we've adopted them? Personally I'm going to let mine pick my trades. Can't do a worse job than me. But they can paint.

m4wli4,,wallstreetbets,post,1615734009,"Yesterday I made a post explaining calls, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4a87a/i_teach_high_school_which_means_i_explain_things/).  In it, I said I'd explain puts later.  It's later, so I'm explaining them below.  I also had a lot of people ask me further questions about selling calls, so after I talk about puts, I'm going to cover some of that info to clear up confusion.  Assuming this goes as well as the last one, maybe I'll do one more post about options, in which I'll talk about writing calls/puts, and maybe go into a little more detail about the Greeks and how options are priced and valued.  We'll see. 

Moving forward, if you didn't read yesterday's post, then the first thing you should do is read that, because I'm going to use terminology and refer to concepts that were explained in that post.

**WHAT IS A PUT OPTION**

If a call is a bet that that a stock is going to go up, then a put option (hereafter referred to as a ""put"") is a bet that a stock is going to go down.  Like a call, a put is contract involving 100 shares.  However, instead of giving you the ability to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price, a put option gives you the ability to sell 100 shares of stock at the strike price.

Example:  Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think it is going to tank.  You can buy a put option for $100, and if the price of GME drops below $100, you're ITM.

**HOW DO PUTS WORK?**

The same way as calls.  You buy them the same way, you pay for them the same way (premiums), you sell them the same way if you don't want to exercise (more on this later, as selling your contracts was the most common question I got yesterday), and they are impacted by theta decay and IV the same way.

One key difference is the exercising of a put option, which we'll look at in a second.  Other than that, there isn't much more to put here.  If you understand calls, then you understand puts.  Beyond exercising, the only real difference is that you are betting on the price to go down instead of up.

**CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE ANYWAY?  I WAS LYING WHEN I SAID I UNDERSTOOD CALLS.**

Sure.

Let's say that GME is trading at $300, and you think the the hedgies are winning and the squeeze is over.  Or maybe you think that the squeeze is going to squoze next week, and after that the price is going to drop once everyone takes their profits.  Regardless, by 3/26, you think that the price will drop back down to $40 or lower.

So you buy an $8.32 GME 100p 3/26.  Do we remember what that means and how much it costs?  It means you spent $832 for the right to sell 100 shares of GME for $100 on or before 3/26.

Now you wait.  If 3/26 comes and goes and the price never drops, then your option expires OTM.

But if you were correct and the price does drop below $100, then you are ITM and have a choice to make.  You can sell the contract or exercise it.

**OK, SO HOW IS EXERCISING A PUT DIFFERENT THAN EXERCISING A CALL**

If you choose to exercise a call, you have one option: buy the shares.  When exercising a put, you have three options.

1.  If you already have 100 shares of GME (maybe you missed the peak and are holding a bag), then exercising the put is as easy as making the option writer buy your shares.  You give them 100 shares of GME, and they give you $10,000 ($100/share x 100 shares).  

2.  If you don't have 100 shares of GME, then you can buy 100 shares for whatever the stock price is (if it dropped all the way to $40, then you'd buy them for $40) and then sell them to the option writer for $100 share.  That's dumb.  Don't do that.

3.  If you think it has farther to fall (and you have a margin account), you can enter a short position.  You borrow 100 shares and sell them to the option writer for $100, then you wait and buy them back later to replace the shares you borrowed.  That's big dumb.  Don't do that either.

Really, though, you should be selling your contracts instead of exercising, because exercising contracts throws away any extrinsic value you may have built (see below).  Plus, you probably don't want and can't afford 100 shares of whatever stock you have options on.

**THE PART WHERE I TALK ABOUT SELLING YOUR OPTION CONTRACTS AND ANSWER SOME COMMON QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB THAN LAST TIME.  I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUTS AND CALLS BOTH HERE.**

*First, let's talk about value and taking advantage of that value to sell for profit.*

We talked about this a little yesterday, but you need to make sure you understand that your option has value from when you buy it until it expires, and that you can use that value to make money.  Does that mean it has value even when it's OTM?  Yes, even OTM options have value (see: extrinsic value from yesterday).  Why?  Because people buy OTM contracts.  In fact, OTM contracts can even make you money while still OTM.  Did you buy a $400c when the stock price was $100?  If the stock price gets to $350, you may be OTM, but your $400c contract can be worth more now than it was when you bought it (assuming there is time left before expiration and theta isn't killing you).  But how can you buy an OTM contract and then sell that same contract for profit when it is still OTM?  Remember the premiums.  When people buy options, they pay the option seller a premium to buy that contract.  The premium on a way OTM contract is going to be very cheap.  The premium on a ""near the money"" contract that is that has time to spare is going to be higher.  If you buy that contract when it is way OTM and sell it when it is near the money, the price the buyer gives you could be higher than the price you paid to the seller, which equals profit.  The same is true of a put.  If you buy a $100p when the share price is $400, you'll be able to sell that contract for a profit if the price drops to $150 (again, assuming you aren't running out of time.  Time is a big deal.  Seriously.  I'll talk about that later).

On the other hand, an OTM option that is running out of time and not even close to strike (or hasn't move appreciably since bought) isn't going to have as much value as it did when you bought, and any sale would be at a loss.  But remember that you can still sell it even if it is losing.

ITM options always have value because they are worth the difference between the stock price and strike (remember intrinsic value?), which can't be zero if the stock is trading above strike.

*So when can I sell my contract?*

Anytime.  You can sell it ITM, OTM, or ATM (at the money, which means the stock is trading at the strike price.  I don't think we talked about ATM options yesterday).  Are you approaching expiration and the stock is trading sideways and you don't think you're going to hit the strike before time runs out?  You can sell it and cut your losses.  Did the stock spike deep ITM but you think it's going to crash back down?  Sell that thing and realize some profit.

*Who determines the price of a contract?  Who determines the premiums?  Do I set the premiums when I sell my contract?*

The premium/value of a contract is determined by an arcane combination of factors, including time to exercise, strike price, stock price, volatility, and others.  There is a lot of Greek involved.  There may be actual magic involved, too.  Either way, the price is set for you and you don't have to worry about it.  

*But who's going to buy my contract?  If nobody ever wants to execute, then who ends up with all the calls?  If nobody has shares to sell, who ends up with all the puts?*

I was surprised at how many people asked me this question.  The short answer is that it doesn't matter.  Someone will buy your contract.  The medium answer is that it could be individuals, institutions, or the market maker absorbing the trade if no one else will.  Regardless, calls/puts that weren't offset will be exercised by some entity or other.  In the case of calls, if they didn't want the shares, they'll just sell them.  In the case of puts, if they didn't have the shares to sell, then they'll buy them.

*If I sell my contract to someone else, am I on the hook when they exercise?*

No.  The writer, or the person who created the contract and first sold it, is the only person who will be on the end of an exercise.  If you write a call that goes ITM, then you can get assigned and have to cough up some shares.  If you bought a call and then sold it when it went ITM, then you don't have to sell any shares to cover.  If you want to learn about writing calls/puts, then maybe I'll do that next time.

*What if I don't sell my ITM option when it expires?*

It depends on the brokerage and whether or not you have a margin account.  Your brokerage will either exercise them, sell the contract for you, or let it expire.

*So what is the deal with time, then?  Or, when should I sell my contract?*

Time, which is referred to and measured as theta, plays a big part in the extrinsic value (or potential, as we talked about yesterday) of an option.  The closer you get to expiration, the faster theta decay (the loss of value due to time) is going to increase, and the faster you are going to start losing value.  In fact, there can be instances in which the stock price goes up, but your option value still goes down because theta decay is eroding value faster than the other pricing factors are increasing value.  For this reason, you generally don't want to wait until expiration to sell a call, and should have a plan to do so earlier.  Theta Decay is real.

*So when is ""earlier?""*

There are too many factors for the valuation of each option to give you a standard time to sell.

**IN CONCLUSION**

If you think a stock is going to go up, buy a call.  If you think it's going to go down, buy a put.  Sell your contracts.  Don't exercise them.  Don't wait until the last minute.  You have nothing to lose but your ~~chains~~ premiums.

That's most of what I can think of to say about the basics of buying/selling options.  Is there more to it than that?  Yes, but adding it in here will make it too long and too technical, and more articles that are too long and too technical aren't going to help people who are struggling to get the basics.  As I said above, I might do one last options post about writing contracts and maybe covering the Greeks.  We'll see.  Regardless, it won't be today or tomorrow.  Maybe next weekend.

Furthermore, more funding could go to philanthropic efforts and education (really the number 1 thing we need). GME could then just proliferate into so many places that everyone benefits. We really need a company to lead an effort like this. I can think of no better candidate. +And some of us get tendies to do the things we've always dreamed of... but...

m5094m,,wallstreetbets,post,1615744887," About one year ago I decided to open a new account just for fun dedicated to active trading with $69k. Today is the one year anniversary of the said account. So I am celebrating $1.3M in gains with three cups of morning coffees instead of my usual two. I felt a lot of rules we set on ourselves limit returns we can get. The strategies I use for this account would be shitted on by investment professionals and most people lurking on value investing forums. This account was dedicated for fun trading using strategies that I don't implement on the other accounts I manage. I have been sharing my DDs here with the community.

For those asking for the trade history. There was several hundred trades if not thousands over the past year. It is not possible to share everything I did over the past year in a screen shot. I have shared my best DDs here in the past and my 45.7k Karma points at that.  

I want to mention that for the first half of the year I did not invest in options and my leverage is always less than 120%. In retrospect that was a mistake and I could have amplified my returns several fold. I do not go long on meme stocks. Mentioning some of the positions would violate Sub rules and I will withhold those unmentionable positions. So here are the top 5 positions in each category:

m4zw0c,,wallstreetbets,post,1615743872,"$GME okay boys and girls, here is an update for tomorrow:

1. Last Thursday & Friday were very healthy consolidation days for us. On wednesday we experienced some volatility, and I'm not even talking about the sudden drop to $170. We rocketed to $348 very quickly which was unsustainable and lead to an inevitable sudden drop. 

If you look at the previous week before that sudden rocket + drop, you'll see that we were steadily gaining from $100 - $250, we want this steady gain, we don't want a sudden rocket UNTIL the hedgefunds are forced to buy back the oversold shares (which will cause an inevitable rocket). 

High volitality and sudden price changes scare people, especially big smart money investor institutes, so we don't want this during the run-up process. 


2. The stability that we have seen last Thursday and Friday is incredibly good news. Remember: if the hedgefunds were dominating this scenario, the share price would be $4. ANYTHING over $4 is a win. A friendly reminder that the price of GME shares was $120 little more than a week ago, and was $40 a little more than two weeks ago. Just hold and keep watching the price increase.


3. The stimulus checks will be a very helpful boost to the health of GME shares, the price may not go up purely because of this stimulus package, but it will definitely help to prevent the price from going down this week.


4. Do not put all your faith in predicted dates. As I am sure you have seen, we have collectively made a move not to promote specific dates. Sure, we are hoping to have big movement *around* Friday March 19th,  but it may be earlier, may be later, may even be a month later - who knows? No one. We can only predict and give as much help as we realistically can. We can not know the future.


5. Hedgefunds who shorted the stock a month ago are STILL in the same shitty position, barely anything has ls changed in that respect. They are trying everything they can to give themselves some time in hopes that we will release the pressure, give up and go home, but what can we do to avoid that from happening? HOLD.

6. And finally, a word of caution. None of this is guaranteed. There are, and will always be, certain factors which are totally out of control, and facts which we can never get confirmed. Welcome to Wallstreet - where lies and cheats get you rich. Do not invest money which you cannot afford to lose. This. Is. Not. Guaranteed.  


And also, just to mention - the closer to Friday 19th, or perhaps Friday 26th, the more volatile this stock will become. Use your best judgement and research and hold for as long as YOU feel comfortable. Don't do it for anyone else, this is your own money that you are investing with. YOU are the only one responsible for it. 

Goodluck to everyone on Monday 15th and remember that every dollar above $4 is a win for us.",Update for Monday...

m4a87a,,wallstreetbets,post,1615654565,"I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them. So here you go.

Note: before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things, remember that this is a basic primer for idiots; some of it has been simplified.

WHAT IS A CALL OPTION: BASICS

A call option (hereafter referred to simply as a ""call"") is a contract that gives you the ability, though not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date, called the expiration date. Example: You buy a $400 call for GME that expires on March 19th. What that means is that at any time between now and end-of-day on 3/19, you can buy 100 shares of GME for $400. If the price spikes to $700 dollars, you can still buy them for $400. That's a pretty good deal.

So I need the price of GME to get to $400 to break even, and anything above that is profit, right? Not quite. You have to pay a premium for the option, which is the amount of money you're giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract. The premium is listed as the price per share, so if the option has a $2 premium, that means that you have to pay $2 per share of GME in the contract, which means that you pay $200 the buy the call ($2/share x 100 shares). You give the seller $200, and they give you the call option. Since you paid $200 for the option, this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share. Why? Because if the price only got to $400, you could have bought it for $400/share without buying the contract, which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste. However, if the price goes to $403/share, then you make a profit, because you effectively paid $402/share for a stock worth $403/share.

But what if the price doesn't go up, or even goes down? Do I have to still buy those shares for $400? No. You never have to buy the shares if you don't want to. Remember, a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400, but not the obligation.

But what if the price of GME goes way up but I don't have $40,000 around to buy 100 shares at $400/share? Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40,000 sitting around, or (slightly advanced info here that you don't need to know) to someone who is trying to offset a position. Regardless of who buys it, they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM, or in the money. What does that mean? Let's look at some option vocabulary.

CALL OPTION VOCABULARY

Strike Price: This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract. In our $400 call option above, the strike price is $400. At any time before the expiration date, you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400/share for the stock.

Exercise: Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock. In the example above, you would spend $40,000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stock's price at the time. Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock? No. If you can't afford to exercise, then you can sell your option to someone else.

Expiration Date: This is when your call expires. if you have a 3/19 expiration date, that means that your call option is no longer good after 3/19

Premium: The premium is the price you pay to the call-seller for the contract, and it is listed as the price per share. Knowing that, how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of .25? If you do the math, it will cost you $25, which is .25/share x 100 shares.

ITM and OTM: ""In the Money,"" and ""Out of the Money."" ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price. If you have a $400 call, and the price of GME goes to $405, then your call is ITM because you can buy a $405 stock for $400. If you then immediately sold the stock for $405, you'd make money. OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price. If you have a $400 call and the price of GME is $350, then your call is OTM. It is important to realize that being ITM doesn't mean being profitable. In the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium, if GME goes to $401, you are ITM because 401>400, but you haven't broken even yet because your break-even price is $402.

FDs: FD is not an investment term, and you don't need to know what it means in order to understand calls. It is a WSB term, and it stands for maggot's delight (but with an F, because autmod won't let me define FDs). FDs are OTM calls with short expirations, and as such are a huge gamble. [The guy who spent 90k on 1dte \(1 ""day to expiration""\) OTM GME calls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3r3v2/found_out_how_to_buy_call_options_yesterday/) Those were all FDs, and they all expired worthless. Why are they called FDs? Because when you buy FDs, you usually end up taking it in the ass.

WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS, THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

You have probably seen something like this: GME $400c 3/19. Let's break it down.

GME $400c 3/19 - The GME stands for Gamestop, which you probably figured out. The $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400. If it said $400p, it would be a put option, but we'll talk about those later. The 3/19 stands for the expiration date.

Now let's make it more complicated. If I said, ""I bought 10 $5 GME $800c 3/19,"" what do I mean?

It means that I bought ten contracts of GME $800 calls with a 3/19 expiration, and I paid $5 per share. If I paid $5 per share, how much did I spend on my contracts? I spent $5,000 ($5/share x 100 shares x 10 contracts).

Now you try it. A $700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share. How would you explain to me that you bought two of them?

You would say that you bought 2 $7 GME $700c 3/19. Now you can look like you know what you're talking about even though you still probably don't.

WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS?

This is confusing. Why do people even do this? People buy call options because you can make a lot of money. If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price, then for every $1 the share price goes above your break-even price, you make $100. If you have a $400c with a break even of $402, and the price gets to $412, then you make $1,000 profit. That's $10 of profit ($412-$402) times 100 shares. You can buy the shares and hold them, or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit. Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money. It is usually better to sell the contract, but that's not an important distinction because most of you can't afford to exercise anyway, and will be selling contracts.

WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS?

When you buy a stock, at least you own the stock. If you buy an option and it expires worthless, then you have nothing. If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held, then he'd still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME, +/- 5% depending on when he bought on Thursday. Instead, he has nothing.

WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING

So you bought a call option, and every time you look at it it's worth a different amount of money. That's because there are actually two types of value in an option: options have Intrinsic Value, and Extrinsic Value.

Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option, If you own a $400c, and the price is $412, then the intrinsic value of the option is $12/share, or $1200, because that's the value you would get if you exercised it right now. as stock price goes up, intrinsic value goes up. Pretty easy.

Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition, so we're going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has, and that potential is based on time and volatility. For example, if there is a long time before expiration, then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM, because more time = more chances for the price to rise. Therefore, options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration. Conversely, less time to expiration = less value, which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases. This is called theta decay, but you don't need to worry about that.

Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value, and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily, because if a stock price swings wildly up and down, there's a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM. This is reflected in a measurement called IV, or Implied Volatility. Like Theta Decay, IV is a more advanced concept that you don't need to understand now as long as you get the basics.

Due to the factors of time (theta) and volatility (IV) constantly changing, the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time. This is why the value of your option will constantly change. Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways (low volatility)? Your option value will decrease as IV drops. Is the stock starting to jump around? Your option value will increase as IV increases.

Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing. Why do you think that is? If the stock value is increasing slowly, but you're way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow, the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise, and your option value can decrease.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS

You can sell your contracts at any time. You don't have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts. This is good, because if the price spikes, you can dump your options for profit and move on. There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guy's 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290. If he had sold then, he wouldn't have lost everything by waiting until expiration.

I BOUGHT A CALL AND I'M ITM! HOW/WHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS

Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button. They get your money, and you get their shares. This can take some time.

OK. I GET IT. BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TL:DR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DON'T GET IT

A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. To buy the contract, you pay a premium to the contract seller. If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract, you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit.

The End.

SO I'M AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY?

No. You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous. Don't go crazy. Buy a call. See how it works for real. Don't YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge. Or do. Live your life how you want; I'm not your dad. Just make sure you post the porn when you win or lose.","I teach high school, which means I explain things to idiots every day. If you still don't understand call options, I got you."

m4v9bs,,wallstreetbets,post,1615729419,"A few months ago, I was in a state of abject despair. I had been through two horrible/extremely heartbreaking relationships back to back, lost my job due to COVID-19(was living on unemployment and savings), I had developed a neck beard nest, was borderline suicidal, sleeping 12+ hours per day, etc. I had no interest in anything but smoking weed, jacking off, and sleeping.

Then, in December, I started following the GME stuff(didn’t have much to invest myself sadly), which lead to a deeper interest in the stock market, etc. I would wake up every day pre market(I had no sleep schedule before so this was big for me) and just sit there and watch various stocks and read discussion. It got addictive and I would be reading for 8 hour long sessions at times. I got more and more into it, to the point where I was reading books about the market(I hadn’t read a book in two years before) and just generally having not depressing thoughts all the time. I got a job in January, but continued basically spending all my free time either stressing about bullshit or reading about the market/looking at charts. At this point, I had begun investing a little money which made it even more interesting. Eventually, around beginning February, I was started to feel back to my normal self somewhat. Still scarred, like not at all ready for love again and scared I will slip back into depression(still have some really low days), but also my interests were coming back, I was having energy again, I was wanting to see/make friends again. 

Now, in March, shit is pretty much back to normal. I now am maybe not as obsessed with the market(some of my other hobbies started to come back like philosophy, tv and movies...I seriously went 6 months without viewing a movie or tv show because I was that depressed lol) but still looking at it every day and actually working on my own SQL project for stock screening. But just wanted to thank this community for proving a catalyst to get me back to normal. I didn’t need drugs, just needed lots of charts for my smooth brain to enjoy.

m507x1,,wallstreetbets,post,1615744802,"There have been a good number of other posts about how GME's valuation is not crazy, and this will be much the same - I just want to raise more awareness about this. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I simply have a wife with several boyfriends.

So, most people think that GME is overvalued because of how quickly it has risen, fallen, and risen again. Today, at this very moment, yes GME is overvalued at this price, but I believe that its current price could go much higher on fundamentals and future growth, and here's why:

**Price and Market cap:** So, yes, the $250 + price seems super high but I think that's because most people only consider the literal share price and not the market cap. Most new retail trades see this price and think that it's crazy because GME's stock price is higher than AAPL and many other bluechip stocks, but the stock price is not what matters, market cap is. GME's current market cap is about 18B. For comparison, AAPL and AMZN market caps are 2.3 and 1.5 trillion respectively. So for new traders, look at the market cap for valuation, not the actual stock price. Most companies that rise significantly in stock price usually split shares and once GME's price stabilizes, I believe that they will too but that's not what we're talking about right now.

**Potential**: Before the squeeze, GME's market cap was hovering in the very low billions (between 1-4 billion). Since then, it has obviously exploded because of the crazy short interest and the famous squeeze. However, since then, I believe that GME is becoming a legitimate value play. Ryan Cohen is a fucking genius and he is intent on shifting GME to a gaming e-commerce GIANT. I think that the reason GME is going up so much right now (it's increasingly healthily not parabolically) is because Wallstreet is starting to see it as a value play as well. If GME can capture the gaming market, part of the gambling market, and parts of the e-commerce market (related to gaming), there's no reason why its valuation couldn't increase significantly above what it is today. Again, Ryan Cohen is an absolute genius when it comes to e-commerce, and I think that people are starting to see that he could turn this company around. Let's say that in a few years, he turns GME around and it gets a market cap of $100 billion, which would put the stock at roughly $1500 (assuming no splits happen). This is why I'm saying that a $1000 + price target is not insane by any means. Now, the only way for that to happen in the short term is for more squeeze activity to occur, but I'm talking long term. I truly believe that with the leadership of Ryan Cohen, this stock could move in a similar way to TSLA (sustained, rapid growth over a long period of time) (and I am not saying that it will have the same market cap as TSLA, it won't, I'm saying the way the stock moves could be similar). That's why I don't consider Hodl to be a meme anymore. I think that GME is truly a good long-term hodl because of its imminent transformation, potential markets, and future fundamentals.

**DFV**: I also want to address DFV. I personally think that when DFV first got into GME he did it for 2 reasons: 1. he saw that it was grossly undervalued (this was before Ryan Cohen) and 2. he saw the disgustingly high short interest and thought there could be a squeeze. Well, he was right on both of those things. Michael Burry also saw similar potential when he invested before the squeeze. As we all know, DFV has consistently increased his position in GME and has hodled through all of the ups and downs. He even doubled down after the senate hearing. Do you really think that someone would put millions of dollars into a stock that just got beat down just to stick it to the senators or to make a joke? NO! DFV truly likes the stock as a value play and sees the long-term potential in GME - he's not just in it for the short squeeze or the memes, otherwise, he would've been out last month and wouldn't have doubled down.

**Numbers**: I'm guessing many of you are saying to yourselves ""but uncle Hank, my smooth brain can't comprehend GME going up to $100B without some numbers."" Well, here you go retard. First, I just want to say that $100B is an arbitrary number that I'm just using to say it can go multiples higher.

Here are some big e-commerce stocks: AMZN, SHOP, BABA, WMT, EBAY, PYPL, CHWY. Here are some popular gaming/gambling stocks: ATVI, PENN, DKNG, BYD. So, all of these stocks have market caps in the 10's or 100's of billions. The e-commerce stocks are particularly appealing to GME because that's where Cohen will likely shift GME to. E-commerce continues to grow exponentially and has only increased because of covid. Gaming as its own industry is also rising dramatically with most of the growth being from digital sales. Finally, as everyone knows, gambling is one of the up-and-coming industries that will only continue to grow with increased legalization (especially sports gambling and other online types of gambling). In 2020, US consumers spent over $800B in e-commerce merchants alone. Global e-commerce sales in 2020 were over 4T and are expected to grow over 500B each year. The video game market is estimated to be over 60B in the US and the global gaming market is estimated to be around 150B. Finally, the global online gambling market is estimated to be about 50B and will only rise more with increased legalization. So what does all of this mean? The potential markets that GME can tap into are worth many, many trillions of dollars. Obviously, GME is not going to capture a large portion of these markets, but what this shows is that GME is attempting to go into several industries that already have HUGE markets and are growing fast, and that if GME can get even a fraction of these markets, it will increase its revenue and thus its valuation by multiples. This means that GME is tapping into markets with HUGE potential customer bases and revenue sources. This is not even to mention the fact that GME is already the go-to brick-and-mortar gaming destination (not a very big factor but it obviously helps some).

**Chewey**: This is my most important point. I believe that Ryan Cohen wants to make GME the Chewey of gaming e-commerce. What did Ryan Cohen do with Chewey? He made Chewey into the go-to pet food/supply e-commerce store. Before Chewey, there wasn't a go-to pet food/supply e-commerce store. He essentially e-commerceified the pet food industry. I believe that his goal is to do the same with GME and that GME has wayyyyyyy more potential than Chewey. As shown above, gaming, online gambling, and e-commerce are much, much larger markets than pet food. GME is also already an established brand, so Cohen doesn't have to start it from nothing. There is also not an established go-to for gaming e-commerce. So, I believe that Ryan Cohen is going to make GME the Chewey of gaming e-commerce, which is a far bigger industry than pet food, and the fact that he is starting with an already established brand and isn't starting from nothing makes this even bigger. If you think that Ryan Cohen is not going to make some dramatic change to GME, then why the fuck would he put billions into a failing company? This man is intent on radically transforming the company. 

**Conclusion:** Yeah bitch I like the stock. $1500 is not a joke. I want to emphasize that the only way for GME to get to $1500 in the short term is with more squeeze activity, which I am obviously rooting for. But long-term, I believe that GME will be well above the current price of $260ish. Do I still think the squeeze will happen and do I want it to happen? You bet (check my post history for proof). Though I am rooting for another squeeze, however, I also see the long-term potential in GME as a value investment as I think DFV and many others now do as well. Again, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.

Bio:

After witnessing the slaughter of his family this tiny chimpanzee was kept tied up by Chadian rebels at their forest camp near the border of Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon.

When the rebels were flushed out they fled leaving the young chimpanzee behind, luckily he was then rescued by officers of the Ministry of Fauna. Noah arrived at our sanctuary in Mefou forest in January 2018, starving, confused and frightened, jumping at every new sound. He was estimated to be ten months old and weighed just five kilograms. 

He was emaciated and had wounds on his hip joints from being tied up. Initially he appeared to only recognise bread as food but within 48 hours he was eating everything in sight relishing especially oranges, bananas and papaya. He was delighted to discover yoghurt! 

After his traumatic experiences it is no surprise that Noah did show some signs of stress and was ready to bite his caregiver if he was frustrated. 

It did not take long however before he bonded with his caregivers strongly, responding well to gentle grooming and tickling. Once Noah had regained his health and strength it was time to be integrated with the other babies. 

When Noah first met Sandie he was very happy and tried to play however she initially refused but it did not take long for her to become interested and they have been best friends ever since. When first introduced to the boys Lomié and Farah, Noah was scared and wanted to stay on his caregivers lap. When the older boys approached, Noah shouted at them, even though they were being calm and wanted to play. Farah and Lomié were not put off by Noah’s display tactics, they watched him for a while and then started running past him pulling his feet, testing his reactions .With interest Noah watched Farah and Lomié play and by the end of the day Noah started to tentatively play with the boys, regularly returning back to his caregiver for reassurance. With that promising end to the first day everyone was keen to see how they would all go the next day. 

Everyone was thrilled when the day started with hugs all around between Noah and his new friends. The hugs reassured Noah and with this new confidence he set off exploring with Lomié. In no time he was climbing trees with the other baby chimps and playing in the forest. Noah has since been integrated into our PreNursery group where he lives with a small group of young chimps. We expect him to continue to thrive in the sanctuary happily in the company of his own kind.",

m4yhun,,wallstreetbets,post,1615739810,"There are a lot of numbers thrown about these days. To help me get a better grasp at what a difference selling at 1 000 or hodling til serious numbers makes, I made a little spreadsheet. To not get blinded by the big numbers, I also converted the results to a monthly payout over 30 years, basically to help me understand what impact it would have on my need to earn an income. Maybe it is of use for others in getting mental strength to not sell at 1 000.

You enter the number of shares you hold, and the average price you paid for each. It fetches the current shareprice. It gives the option to sell a number of shares to recup your initial investment, thus giving you peace of mind for the further battles. Or YOLO all the way (i.e. enter 0), you decide.

There are two strategies I accounted for: Selling in stages or selling all your shares at once.

It will calculate the total gain for you, and also how much that would mean per month over a 30 year period. For me it made it very clear why there isn't really a point in selling at 1 000, if there is only the remotest chance of it going to much higher figures. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and hopefully this spreadsheet can add to our arsenal of anthropoid defense weaponery.
